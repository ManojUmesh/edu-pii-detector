 Challenge & selection 

 The tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the   mind map . 

 What exactly is a mind map ? According to the definition of <ADDRESS> T. and <NAME> B. ( 1999 , Dessine - moi   l'intelligence . <ADDRESS> : Les Éditions d'Organisation . ) , the mind map ( or heuristic diagram ) is a graphic   representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain 's   potential to be released . Cf Annex1 

 This tool has many advantages : 

 •   It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done   quickly 

 •   It is scalable 

 •   It allows categorization and linking of information 

 •   It can be applied to any type of situation : notetaking , problem solving , analysis , creation of   new ideas 

 •   It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn 

 •   It is fun and encourages exchanges 

 •   It makes visible the dimension of projects , opportunities , interconnections 

 •   It synthesizes 

 •   It makes the project understandable 

 •   It allows you to explore ideas 

 The creation of a mind map starts with an idea / problem located at its center . This starting point   generates ideas / work areas , incremented around this center in a radial structure , which in turn is   completed with as many branches as new ideas . 

 This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized , it is a map of the thoughts . 

 Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method . 

 Application & Insight 

 I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board   ( white or paper board ) . In the center of the board , I write and highlight the topic to design . 

 Through a series of questions , I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map . I adapt the series   of questions according to the topic to be addressed . In the type of questions , we can use : who , what ,   when , where , why , how , how much . 

 The use of the “ why ” is very interesting to understand the origin . By this way , the interviewed person   frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning . I plan two   hours for a workshop . 

 Design Thinking for innovation reflexion - Avril 2021 - <NAME> <NAME> 

 After modelling the mind map on paper , I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their   work with the addition of color codes , images and interconnections . This second workshop also lasts   two hours and allows the mind map to evolve . Once familiarized with it , the stakeholders discover   the power of the tool . Then , the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive   exchanges between the stakeholders . Around this new mind map , they have learned to work   together and want to make visible the untold ideas . 

 I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for   decision - makers . These presentations are the core of my business models . The decision - makers are   thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them .   They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation . 

 Approach 

 What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for   the project . This tool helps to give meaning . The participants appropriate the story and want to keep   writing it . Then , they easily become actors or sponsors of the project . A trust relationship is built ,   thus facilitating the implementation of related actions .

 Design Thinking Assignment 

 Visualization Tool 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank . As   a result of a poorly implemented linear solution , a more customer centric approach was   needed . 

 After learning about design thinking in this course , we decided to apply it to solve this   problem . The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using   diagrams , figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders .   Previous to this change , none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them , but the   new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them   understand the problem in the way the team and I did . 

 Application 

 The process starts in the prep time . The team uses a series of tools and software to   develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we   created during the process . The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual   way , rather than verbally was a game changer . 

 After having a presentation prepared , the team hands an activity to the stakeholders ,   where the solutions discussed previously appear . Nonetheless , the solutions need more   work to them . After this . The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions   while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their   suggestions would impact on this specific problem . 

 The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their   investors . It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as   show how customer centric the solutions are . Every complaint and suggestion from   customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course ( Involving : can   we do it ? Can we afford it ? … ) . The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the   stakeholders on the same page . It allows them to completely understand and feel part   of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions , which eases the   work of the team . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team . It increased the   productivity and the success rate as well as the customer / stakeholders satisfaction . The   use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 find a solution based on their customer satisfaction . This solution is later revised and   tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process . 

 Presentations , graphics , and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction . As a   company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the   varying levels of understanding , but when paired with the adequate process things just   flow .

"Reporting process 

 by <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> 

 I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller , along with my actual position of 

 Country CFO . The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results 

 for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated 

 those . 

 When I was receiving the position , I went to visit my colleague , former <NAME> <NAME> , 

 who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller . 

 The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers 

 sent him an email with the main figures for the week , he forwarded those to his country 

 accountant who consolidated it , the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he 

 finally reported to the headquarters . The whole process took almost a full business day to 

 complete . 

 Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my 

 country had more operations , I decided to change the process in order to reduce the 

 duration and to ensure standardization in the format , and actually , reduce the human 

 intervention , making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file . 

 Selection 

 Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file , I select some of those to 

 determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the 

 process of the information and the reading of the same . In that sense , we form a group of 

 the country controllers , country CEOs , IT guys , and people from the headquarters to find the 

 best solutions possible . 

 Application 

 For the first lunch , we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy - paste 

 processes and reducing the manual intervention so , we build an online application where all 

 the controllers fill the figure of their respective country , along with the comments . During the 

 first week of the first stage , we sent the new report along with the old one , and after the 

 meeting with the headquarters team , we ask for a post - meeting review of the new format , all 

 the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next 

 report . 

 For the second lunch , we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review 

 meeting , we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one . The final report 

 included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment 

 from about 36 men hours to around 8 , without missing any valuable information and 

 including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much . 

 Insight 

 With the application of the learning launch tool , the controller ’s team along with the main 

 stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions . 

 On the other hand , we found probable requirements from headquarters , expecting to find 

 that a more agile approach that improved the workflow , reduced the time investment of 

 everyone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied 

 with the results of the exercise and the new report . 

 The final report was slightly different from what we anticipated , but the differences were 

 more related to form and a few topics to be included in the report . 

 Approach 

 Despite that , the team was not used to design thinking tools , they were able to work with the 

 learning launch that was the appropriate tool . The team needs to review the insight gained 

 from our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future 

 launch designs , especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take 

 at least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter .

 Challenge 

 My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without 

 sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant , and can not 

 cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months . 

 The company is in a dilemma , as it has two potential investors ; The first 

 investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the 

 plant , in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain 

 changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has 

 shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50 % 

 in the company , the second investor offers the capital necessary for the 

 creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the 

 final product , since this is the one that is generating the exponential 

 growth of the company , for the moment it is only asked to focus on the 

 company 's success product and as they recover the investment they can 

 be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20 % stake 

 within the company . 

 As a manager of the company , I need to make the best decision for the 

 above mentioned one . 

 Selection 

 I decided to choose the visualization tool , visualization allows me to 

 understand and analyze the context , to be able to define the needs and 

 their possible solutions . This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision 

 of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires ; 

 through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors , such 

 as <NAME> and <NAME> ; and based on this I can make the best decision . 

 Application 

 In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set 

 myself , the tool has been of a very wide utility , since when applying it to 

 my challenge very good results were obtained , since with this I could have 

 an analysis to the measure of the two investors . The first thing I did with 

 my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required 

 the flagship product of the company , first I had to understand why the 

 demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months , by applying 

 the tool I could find the answers to this question ; I could see that 

 customers needed this product as it was , without any modification 

 because the product worked wonders . 

 With this study of the clients interested in the product , I was able to 

 analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two 

 investors . 

 I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first 

 instance to supply the product that was having great success . Which was 

 the second investor , since he was interested in first of all to give the size 

 of production that our customers demanded , and then worry about 

 improving it , but in small and concise steps . 

 I discarded the first investor , as he did not meet the requirements that the 

 company needed at that time . I realized that this investor was convinced 

 that by changing the product to the way he thought , the demand was 

 going to increase more ; but in reality what the company needed was to be 

 able to cover the demand that the product was having , this investor 

 wanted to throw everything we had , to the side of the road , but he did not 

 think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in 

 case things do not go as well as expected . 

 Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points 

 of the company 's needs and how each investor , according to their 

 proposals , could help me , based on this I made the best decision . I chose 

 to work with the second investor , we were able to supply the demand for 

 the product , then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into 

 research for product innovation , and make some small changes , which 

 were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities . 

 When customers became more interested in the improved product , we 

 decided to increase production by improving the product . 

 Perspective 

 The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we 

 obtained by using the visualization tool , the first thing is that we must 

 always think first about the needs of customers , of the people interested 

 in the product ; it is very useful to know what the problem is , what is the 

 cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution . Secondly , 

 based on what we have obtained , we can find a partner that fits our 

 needs , and be able to work as a team , unifying ideas and producing 

 possible solutions . Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design 

 course , I was able to create a strategic plan for the company 's problems 

 and make it a successful plan . 

 Approach 

 What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used , I 

 would like to use the learning launch ; I would do it in the following way , 

 rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that 

 the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the 

 required demand . It may or may not work out , but I would like to have 

 employed this strategy .

"Assignment :    Visualization   Reflection    Submitted   by :   <NAME> <NAME>    Course :    Design   Thinking   for   Innovation      Trail   Challenge :   To   Build   or   Not   to   Build      An   environmental   charity   wanted   to   conduct   a   fundraising   campaign   to   raise   $ 4   million   to   build   a    public   path   in   a   busy   tourist   area   of   a   small   town   in   British   <ADDRESS> ,   <ADDRESS> .   They   had   been   gifted   a    large   piece   of   land   by   a   local   landowner ,   which   was   a   substantial   gift   and   prevented   them   from    needing   to   purchase   the   land ,   however ,   they   still   needed   to   raise   a   large   amount   of   money   in   order   to    pay   for   the   supplies   and   labor   to   build   the   trail .       Even   though   the   local   community   appeared   to   be   supportive   of   the   trail ,   they   could   not   provide    enough   money   from   private   donations   to   build   it .   If   the   summer   vacation   property   owners   did   not    provide   some   funding ,   then   there   was   a   strong   possibility   that   they   would   not   raise   enough   money   to    complete   the   trail .   The   charity   did   not   know   if   the   community   as   a   whole   would   support   the   project    and   needed   to   conduct   testing   with   key   influencers   and   potential   donors   to   gauge   their   interest .    Building   the   trail   without   testing   the   support   first   was   too   risky   because   the   charity   did   not   have    enough   money   in   reserve   to   cover   the   cost   of   the   trail   if   the   fundraising   efforts   were   not   successful .       Tool   Selection :   Visualization      Visualization   is   the   process   of   “ assembling   scattered   ideas   into   a   compelling   story   that   can   generate    vivid   mental   images ”   ( Designing   for   Growth ,   p49 ) .    As   the   consultant   for   the   study ,   I   chose    visualization   because   the   charity   had   a   firm   concept   of   why   they   needed   the   trail ,   how   it   would    benefit   the   town ,   and   how   much   it   would   cost   but   needed   a   persuasive   way   to   tie   it   all   together .   The    business   case   for   the   project   was   strong   but   without   a   tool   to   help   them   illustrate   how   the   trail   would    positively   impact   the   residents ,   there   was   little   chance   people   would   donate   enough   to   meet   the    budget .   We   needed   a   tool   that   provided   a   “ head   and   heart ”   message   to   convince   people   to   support    the   project .   Visualization   provided   the   perfect   combination   of   key   messaging ,   beautiful   photography ,    architectural   renderings ,   safety   data ,   and   budget   criteria   to   create   the   vision   for   the   project   in   an    easy‐to‐read   document   that   was   only   four   pages   in   length .   Visualization   allowed   us   to   describe   the    urgent   and   compelling   need   for   the   trail   in   a   succinct   and   tangible   way .       Application      Once   we   drafted   the   vision   document ,   we   worked   with   the   charity   to   identify   a   list   of   people   whose    opinion   would   be   important   to   the   success   ( or   failure )   of   the   fundraising   campaign .   The   list   included    past   and   potential   donors ,   key   influencers   in   the   community   such   as   large   landowners   and   business    owners ,   affluent   summer‐only   residents ,   and   elected   officials .   We   requested   one‐hour   meetings   with    all   of   the   people   on   the   list .   If   people   did   not   want   to   meet   with   us   in   person ,   which   was   often   the 

 case   with   the   part‐time   residents ,   we   offered   to   conduct   the   meetings   by   phone .   When   someone    agreed   to   meet   with   us ,   we   emailed   them   the   vision   document   so   they   could   read   it   in   advance   and    prepare   their   questions .   This   created   a   good   environment   for   an   informed   and   candid   dialogue .      While   the   scheduling   of   the   interviews   was   in   progress ,   we   designed   a   questionnaire   to   guide   our    discussions .   Consistently   using   the   questionnaire   ensured   that   we   covered   the   same   questions   with   all    the   interviewees .   The   goal   was   to   speak   with   20   –   25   key   influencers   in   the   community   and   gauge    their   interest   in ,   or   opposition   to ,   supporting   the   fundraising   efforts   for   the   trail   as   either   donors   or    campaign   volunteers   or   both .   We   successfully   met   with   24   interviewees   and   compiled   the   feedback    into   a   summary   report   along   with   recommendations   for   the   charity .   The   entire   process   took   three    months .      Insight      Fundraising   and   design   thinking   both   require   a   willingness   to   adapt   and   fail   fast .   Good   fundraisers   are    responsive   to   their   donors   and   design   thinking   serves   as   the   perfect   platform   to   plan   and   launch   new    fundraising   initiatives ;   it   is   an   ideal   methodology   for   solving   complex   philanthropic   issues .   We   are   not    formally   taught   design   thinking   models   in   fundraising   classes   but   they   should   be   added   to   the    curriculum .       Although   it   is   not   explicitly   stated   in   the   course   videos ,   it   occurred   to   me   that   both   fundraising   and    design   thinking   are   rooted   in   communication   and   relationships   and   both   are   iterative   processes   based    on   testing   and   investigation .   The   elusive   synergy   between   art   and   science   is   as   beautifully   illustrated    by   design   thinking   as   it   is   as   inherent   in   daily   fundraising   practice .        Improvements   for   Next   Time      Visualization   was   an   effective   tool   in   this   circumstance   and   I   would   use   it   again   in   a   similar   situation .    However ,   it   would   also   be   enlightening   to   create   a   journey   map   with   a   wide   spectrum   of   people   from    the   town   because   there   were   many   assumptions   made   during   the   visualization   process   about   how   the    trail   would   be   used   and   what   benefits   would   be   desired   by   the   tourists ,   local   public ,   and   sponsors .    Journey   mapping   would   have   confirmed   the   validity   of   those   assumptions   and   supplemented   the   data    gathered   during   the   interviews .       The   other   tool   that   I   would   use   next   time   in   conjunction   with   visualization   is   storytelling .   I   would   take    someone ’s   first   hand   account   of   the   situation   and   create   a   short   video   to   showcase   the   urgency   of   the    project   or   program   from   his / her   perspective .   A   link   to   the   video   would   be   included   in   the   email   about    the   interview   along   with   a   PDF   of   the   vision   document .   I   think   this   would   provide   a   holistic   micro   and    macro   perspective   to   the   exercise   and   spark   some   interesting   conversations   in   the   interviews .

"Cheese Startup - Learning Launch ​by <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 We are a small company in <ADDRESS> ( <ADDRESS> ) that refines high - quality organic cheeses   from small producers in the Pyrenees . We also trade milk and yogurts from these   producers . We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants ( 60 % of   our turnover ) and to <NAME> stores ( 35 % of our turnover ) , the remaining 5 % we   distribute to individuals , mainly family , friends and acquaintances .     Selection 

 I have chosen the "" Learning Launch "" because it is more adapted to my way of working   and the needs of the company .     Application 

 Due to the coronavirus crisis , all restaurants have closed and <NAME> store sales   have dropped dramatically . therefore we have had to change our target niche and head   towards private individuals and common stores .     We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals . In the survey   we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume , as well as milk and   yogurts , also the type of milk ( goat , cow , sheep ) , the level of curing and the price they   would be willing to pay for our products . We have also proposed sending boxes with   different products on offer , in which the average price is significantly lower .     After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores , we have focused   our offer on a certain type of product , we have distributed it and analyzed the result not   only with our customers but also with objective sales figures .     Insight 

 The result has been spectacular , our weekly turnover had fallen to 25 % with a loss of   75 % ( 60 % of restaurants and 15 % of delicatessen stores ) . The situation was dramatic   but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5 % to 25 % and common food stores   have gone from 0 % to 15 % . 

 Approach 

 Our situation is not good , but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy   recovers . We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based   on the client and transferred to the producer . Before , we used to transfer products from   small producers to customers . Now the flow has changed .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> : 

 There is a company which provides financial advisory to customers either in person or virtual .   Lately organisation climate has been seen decayed as result of arguments , hassles and the   lack of fraternity and cooperation among the campaign workers . The aim is improving   climate organisation to transmit unity and trust to our customer . 

 Selection : 

 <NAME> is the first tool selected , because this tool allows to connect with the audience ,   to make understandable the message , and to transmit emotions . Campaign workers would   feel identified and understand the importance of tolerance and empathy . 

 Application and insight : 

 Many stories were told in various sections . Stories from previous experiences , fictional   stories , and stories told by participants created a different atmosphere due to participants   started to produce deeper relationships among them and recognize the importance of being   empathic . An important result was that meeting with clients were longer . 

 Approach : 

 The activities work in a good way , but visualization tool would work very well in a challenge   like this . Showing the way , some elements to get a harmonious atmosphere through   visualization is an option in a further situation .

"Storytelling   The Path to Innovation 

 <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Be it any organization , team or a government venture , I have often observed that they experience   failures because they could n’t connect with their audience aptly . In such scenarios , storytelling   can turn the table significantly . I have used the tool ‘ storytelling ’ in my organization to convey a   complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me . The idea   is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the   targeted audience . I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience . I   have used the technique in front of my team - members of the organization to impart its essence ,   brainstorm notions , make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies . The crucial   element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted   audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story . When I shared the story , I   tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it   related to their work emotions . The information and feedback immensely helped me in   recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world . 

 Application 

 I used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the   essence and impact of revolutionary thinking . I understood that the story has to make sense so   that they can comprehend the context and relate with it . I started the story of the time when there   was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc . and a company brought   a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products . I emphasized on its out - of- the box thinking & ideas that made the brand conquer the market . I observed that my audience   were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company . After I finished , there   were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing   project . The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming . 

 Insight & Approach 

 When I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder , “ Did my tool work ? The answer I   think is ‘ YES ’ . Will it serve the purpose ? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid   them in making apt strategies . ” 

 The exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then   storytelling as a design - thinking tool , if implemented efficiently , can bring ground - breaking   changes in organizations & countries . I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience ,   inspired them to think new and deliver better results . 

 As a student of design thinking , I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say   that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking   activities .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 I take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university . We were in contact 

 with Capão das Antas , a rural Community in the suburbs of <NAME> <NAME> ( SP - <ADDRESS> ) . We had the   intention to criate , with the local producers , a project that wold improve the quality of life in   the neighborhood . For that , in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Capão   and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes . After some visits we   concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local   farms . Therefore , we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase   their rent . 

 Selection 

 In order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers , we made a first test 

 were we delivered the products at the costumer ’s door . The action had a good result but we   want to increase even more ours sales . So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and   then improve our business model . 

 Application 

 After we analise all the data we had and build the business model , Its was far from be 

 the most sustainable and profitable one . To improve our project , we made a plan to test new   ways of seling . So every week , after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer   door , we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model . 

 In order to give examples of how it works , after some weeks we notice that the 

 farmers were having problems in separate the orders . The costumers were ordering with na   app called whatsapp , but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was   messy with the conversations feed . As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app   that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed . Therefore we tested this improvement   in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders . 

 Insights 

 The application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building 

 a solid business model . Therefore , I learned that the more you test possibles ideias , more   chance of sucess you have . Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to   achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there . 

 Approach 

 During all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on 

 what we were seeing during the deliveries . I think that we could have achieved better results   by analysis more sources of data , like feedback from all the stakeholders . Besides that we   could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business   model .

 Topic 7 

 “ Why are people sometimes altruistic ? ” 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 MDI-191 student 

 <NAME> 

 April , 2020 

 In many classical economic theories , it is common to determine a human , as a very egoistic   creature . <NAME> <NAME> ’s books ( but not all of them ) were wrote based on this idea also .   However , the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by <NAME> <NAME>   <NAME> in the nineteens century and it assumes , that all human beings are consistently rational ,   narrowly self - interested , and who pursue their subjectively - defined ends optimally1 . However ,   in our real life we face acts of altruism very often : our parents provide us with all necessary   goods , a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless   people . So , it is very clear , that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time ,   they also tend to help others . But what makes them to do this ? Why are people sometimes   altruistic ? 

 Gerashchenko Igor in his article “ The ethical teaching of A. <NAME> in the context of the modern   economy ” writes , that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man , as a   single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community . All resources   were so difficult to get , that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for   survival . The following way the system of social values , where helping other people is highly   appreciated , started to form . The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared   much time later , when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from   each other , or to form smaller communities , as nuclear families . But even now , in modern word   and in modern families , we can see people continue to act in altruistic way . So , let ’s try to   discover , what other motives , besides ancient habit , do they have . 

 One of the mechanisms , which makes people act in altruistic way , is called reciprocal ( or   mutual ) altruism . It means , that individuals tend to help someone , who is likely to give   something back . But it does n’t mean , that human beings are egoistic . People subconsciously   wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions ( there the golden rule of   morality2 is taken place ) . <NAME> <NAME> , the author of the article “ The purpose for just   cooperation as a motive of economic behavior ” , provides us with results of the experiment ,   which shows the relevancy of the statement , which was made above : 

 Both of two players ( A and B ) were provided with a certain amount of money ( a and b   respectively ) . Firstly , player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B , and after that   player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money   ( x or y respectively ) they want to give or not to give anything at all . 

 The rational strategy for both players will be not give money . Because in case , when A decided   to share , it would not be profitable for B to share money ( b + xa — yb < b + xa ) . And if A decided   not to give money , B would not give money either . However , in reality , when the experiment   took place , the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money . The average   received sum of money were 32,5 % of the initial one . But in case , when one of the players

 Not to give   a + yb , b — yb   a , b 

 denied the opportunity of cooperation ones , in most of the cases it put the end for the future   transaction , as the condition of relicense was lost . 

 One more thing , which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism , is economic   games . There exist a lot of such games , but the most famous are “ Dictator ” , “ Ultimatum ” and   “ The division of the public good ” .   In “ Dictator ” game one the players receives a sum of money ,   part of which he / she can give to another player . The rational behavior , which is expected from   the first person , is not to give anything , as only in this case he / she will get the maximum   possible profit . Strangely , but in 616 experiments3 , which were carried out , an average given   sum was about 28,35 % of the initial sum and only about 1/3 of all participants gave nothing . The   motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice , as the first person did nothing in   order to get money , so he / she thinks , that it would be fair to share them . 

 Another explanation of altruism is people ’s consciousness about their reputation . As I   mentioned above , altruism is socially approved behavior , so individuals , who are known for   helping people around , may be in more respect , than others . So , the motives for the altruistic   actions can be not only empathy , but also concern for the opinion of others .   Charity donations   are a good example of an altruistic action , which has a considerable impact in person ’s   reputation . In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously , but   names of people , who donate huge amounts of money , are usually well - known and numerous   times mentioned in newspapers , magazines and TV programs . So , philanthropists may expect   more support from the society , if they need , as they are known as a good person . 

 Developing the idea about philanthropy , we face another reason for being altruistic . This   motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization , also known as communal   interest , which differ people from animals . People want to live in comfortable conditions ,   where hospitals , education and other social institutions work well enough . So , they are ready to   contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better   life . That is why the idea of social altruism appeared . Scientists faced the fact , that they are   unable to explain why people continue help others even , when they do not have any filiation at   all . This type of behavior started to take place , when human ’s intentions goes beyond family   and reputational altruism . <NAME> <NAME> and Urs Fischbacher in their article “ Nature of human   altruism ” call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity , which works under the possibility of   altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment ( stigmatization ) . 

 Taking all things into consideration , we can conclude , that altruism has a significant economic   effect not only on one particular person or a small social group , but on the whole society . And   strange , as it may seem , altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for   someone , who receives help . Moreover , many social organizations , even economic ones , would   not work at all , if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way , as due to desire to get the   maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations , what may ruin the whole   system .
