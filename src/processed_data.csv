"<NAME> <NAME> REFLECTION – VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGE 

 While working for my previous employer , a large defense contractor offering products and services from undersea   to outer space , I managed all tradeshow and sponsorship activity for a sector headquartered in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> .   Before I arrived , each business unit was managing their own pool of funds , deciding which shows and sponsorships   in which to participate / contribute and there was no overall structure as to the total sector spend . Decisions were   being made with no regard to sector priorities , large contract bids or future bid considerations . Additionally , there   was no alignment on any of the branding and marketing material , and more than once different business units   from the same sector were appearing at trade shows , without knowledge the other was participating . There was   an immediate need to align the funds under one umbrella and to develop a unified approach to spend , messaging   and participation at tradeshows and with sponsorships . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 For this exercise , I opted to apply the design thinking tool of visualization to first uncover the issue at hand . To help   with our fight to align the budget under one umbrella ( managed by me ) , I first needed to shine a light on just how   many unnecessary ( from a business perspective ) trade shows the business units were attending , how much in   sponsorship money was being dispersed , as well as the total sector spend in these areas . As we know , visualization   as a design tool ( as per slide five in the week one slides ) means to “ make it tangible and concrete ; to draw a   picture , tell a story , take a photo , make a map … ” By pulling together historical data about these spends , compiling   it into one location , making it colored - coded and easy - to - read / filter , I was able to get senior leadership to   understand what I was trying to accomplish and persuade them into what I was trying to do for the organization as   a whole by taking the budget ownership and participation management . 

 While the new tradeshow and sponsorship process would be an evolution beyond just shining the light on the   need ( identifying which to participate in and why , aligning objectives to meet customer and business needs , etc . ) ,   this first step was important in being able to secure buy - in . 

 APPLICATION 

 This was a larger undertaking than one might initially believe . After having initial conversations with each of the   business units , it was clear that not everyone was on the same page ; why would they be ? After all , it did appear as   if we were taking away their autonomy in this area . That was when it was apparent that visualization needed to be   used , in order for the larger picture to be seen . I started first by trying to wrap my head around just how many   tradeshows and sponsorships our business units were participating in and contributing to . Since this function was   never “ managed ” appropriately , there was little documentation and I had to rely on speaking directly to those   within each business unit ( three , in total ) , and digging into past financial history . They were a bit reluctant at first ,   but eventually , I was able to garner the insight I needed to begin pulling together all the data into one place . 

 I used Microsoft Excel to house the data , using different colors to identify the three business units . In doing this , I   was able to provide an all - up look at what tradeshows the sector was paying for exhibits and sending attendees ,   primary business objective for exhibiting / attending , what sponsorships were being purchased , dates / locations of   all activities and total spend for the sector . By using different colors for each business unit , it was easier for   leadership to sort and better understand if the selected events / activities aligned with the larger strategy for each   business unit . It also allowed me to keep everything in one place while having the ability to sort and filter to tailor   different conversations based on the audience . It may seem like a simple approach , but after uncovering that there   was participation in over 60 tradeshows , and contributions to more than 200 sponsorships , it was clear that to   start , all information needed to live in one place and leadership needed to see this visually . Since the budgets for   tradeshows was separate from that of sponsorships , I separated those entries on different tabs . 

 Below is a screen shot of the tradeshow list , with colors and some columns not shown , as to avoid potentially   sharing any proprietary information . The light green highlights shown reflect international tradeshows .

 <NAME> <NAME> REFLECTION – VISUALIZATION 

 INSIGHT 

 This exercise turned out to be extremely valuable and was eye - opening for sector leadership . By being able to see   and sort all the data in one place , leadership was able to just how much money was being spent , and where each   business unit was deciding to focus their budget . In creating a common understanding , through the use of   visualization , eyes were open not only to the challenge the sector was facing , but that there were options and   opportunities to be better aligned and consistent with messaging and approach . Leadership was able to better   understand the problem itself and use data that was already available ( just now in one , organized place ) to begin   considering a more reasonable approach to managing this process . 

 APPROACH 

 This exercise taught me the value in keeping data such as this in a central , organized repository from the   beginning . If there had been better management of tradeshows and sponsorships prior to my starting with the   organization , this would be one step that could have been avoided in the process of identifying a new approach . I   have since taken this more detailed , structured approach , to a new organization with great success . With this   specific example , I would not choose a different design thinking tool based on what was uncovered by going   through this exercise . Visualization was the missing component to connect the dots for those further removed   from the process , and set the stage to use other design thinking tools further along the process to find a new ,   unified approach to managing these efforts .

"Reflection 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I often used the tool Visualization to be able to understand clearly the needs of our 

 clients / customers as well as what will be the expectations of our supervisors that will be needing in order   to succeed on the promotion of the products we are launching . This tool makes us visualize more on how   we can conduct a process flow with no flaws that would encounter . Well there are no perfect team or   should I say a teamwork is a big factor in order to achieve what is the goal setting . Identifying weak spots   and new opportunities will greatly affect the team and the production of the accounts we are handling .   As what the video says , communication is important to be able to understand the needs and wants of our   clients . Each member of the team encounters different kinds of clients and we experience how to handle   them differently . Therefore , this tool will help us as we go along the procedure and production of the   team . 

 Application 

 Our team is handling account opening and maintenance of all clients who are investing . The 

 company launches an issuance that will have to open over 3,ooo accounts in less than a month . In this   manner , and in a short staff team , we have to conduct a series of practices that will have to visualized .   From the way as to how we will receive a bulk of documents until how we will file all those accounts which   we are going to opened . Number of accounts we will received , reviewed and opened is far different from   what we usually do on our team . Therefore , we have to conduct series of trial and error in order to   properly monitored each and every clients ’ accounts . 

 We tried to gather some help from the other team as we pilot launch the issuance of accounts . 

 We visualized by making a graph as to whom will the function be put on and how this will be like a factory   set up that continuously work flawlessly . We still encounter some problems as this accounts can not be   opened in less than a month . So there comes a backlog on the regularization of documents . 

 From then , before we conduct next quarter ’s issuance , we gather all the teams and tried to ask 

 them as to what is the weaknesses encounter during issuance and ask for their suggestions on how we   can come up with a good process flow that will help everyone to work with no hindrances to encounter .   We visualized it by using the traditional whiteboard graph and putting details like the point person per   function , turnaround time of one account to another function . And time limit as to how many accounts   can we accomplished in a day . In this sense , the next issuance is more rigid and simplified other than the   previous one since we already determined what cause the problem . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 I learned that it is important that every team member should cooperate and communicate in 

 order to determine one ’s weaknesses and provide suggestions that can contribute a lot with the   production of the team . There should be a leader that will oversee the function of each members and 

 make sure that no one is leaving behind . This kind of approach will make it easier to properly managed   not just our clients but also the staff of the team . In this way , it will not be that much tiring to do once the   process floe has been managed .

"Challenge 

 During this course , the visualization tool inspired me more than other tools . It reminds me of how I   solved one of the tasks of my company . I used to work as a manager in a fashion school . Our boss   decided to open the second department of school which was going to focus on sewing and couture   technics . As a manager , it was challenging for me -I had to attract new customers and increase sales of a   new department to the same level as the old department in a month . The visualization tool helped me   out in this challenge . 

 Selection 

 In my case time issue gave me an opportunity to find out the shortest and effective way to share - and to   communicate- our school 's goal with the team , to brainstorm possibilities , and to find a logical   resolution . As <NAME> <NAME> said this tool is the way of communication 

 Application 

 As a manager and artistic person as well I gathered my team and explain our goals on the inboard . I   brought documents and mood boards and even found out an inspirational short film about other   fashion schools ' progress story and during our meetings . after 3 hours we already had a draft of a   business plan . we set a goal to do market research and research our customers - student . At the end of   the week , every team member came up with a presentation that included charts , graphics , and research   results . We brainstormed again and set a final meeting with our boss . As she was busy as usual the   shortest and logical way to represent our team 's work and concluded result was the presentation . The   plan was approved 

 Insight 

 The amazing part of our hard week was our feedbacks and results . At the beginning of the second week ,   we welcomed our first 15 students to the new department . Chosen design thinking tool by me worked   out well . Our results for the team , for me , and our boss was blissful . 

 Approach 

 The visualization tool actually was a common tool for this school . But we used it without knowing   technics and appropriate schematics . The launching of the second department gave me more aware of   this tool . And this course taught how it is important and even lifesaving in management of problems and   save time . 

 Thank you !

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> and selection 

 The first tool I use is Visualization , to solve the problems I often face on campus is 

 mind mapping . With this approach , I was able to solve various difficulties I faced , such as 

 finding suitable materials , using appropriate colors to the appearance that would be shown . 

 Then this approach also makes it easier for me as a designer to find alternative paths 

 from a problem that I often face with my lecturers and groups , in my current project , namely 

 making a standing dask with an ergonomic approach and problem solving that I use is Visualization . 

 Application 

 I started the process by separating some elements first such as appearance , size , user , 

 color , so that the expected results can be more satisfactory . In this “ standing desk with an ergonomic 

 approach ” project , I promote the kindness of workers when using a desk so that work attitudes 

 can be better and increase work productivity . 

 Currently I am still waiting for the results of interviews from several sources to 

 complete this project because the problems I face are still quite a lot and this Visualization 

 really helped me in this regard . 

 Insights & Approach 

 Observations were made on humans , the environment , machines , equipment and raw 

 materials used for the production process because they all interacted with each other , thus 

 requiring an understanding of humans and the work facilities they use . Work with a heavy load 

 and the design of work facilities that are not ergonomic result in excessive exertion , also the 

 wrong work posture can cause discomfort at work , this results in complaints and early fatigue . 

 Because I found that this project still has many things that need to be followed up , I apply that 

 Visualization as the best solution for this project . 

"
"Elements : 

 1 . Challenge : There are many challenges which one can face as a teacher . The basic job of a 

 teacher is to teach the young minds and inspire them , and this job is best done when the first   student from your class to the last student is benefited from what you teach . Even if one   student is left out the task a teacher is assigned to do is not accomplished . This challenge   came to me when I had 2 students in my class who were differently able . These 2 students   were a part of inclusive education program of my college and they both were sponsored by a   big financial company , as a part of their CSR activity . Now let me tell you about the   background of these 2 students . One was visually impaired up to 98 % and the other was   suffering from cerebral Palsy and could not walk and always needed a wheel chair . Both the   students came from a poor economic background and were the first ones in their family to go   to such a reputed expensive college . The challenge I faced was that both of them were not   accepted well in the class . I observed that both are sitting in the first bench alone and no one   is talking to them . These 2 students were also scared as they were from a regional language   background and English was not their forte . The other regular students came from effluent   families and were impeccably dressed just like their English , no one bothered to talk to these   2 differently abled students , forget about helping them in their studies . I as a teacher was   deeply troubled as I felt that not intelligent students but the weaker section of students need   a teacher more . Another challenge was that in future more such students will be joining and   so the college students should accept and understand inclusive education . My college had a   tie up with this financial giant and there were more students with special abilities expected in   the coming years . Now I had this great challenge of making the regular students not only to   accept the specially challenged students but also to help them in the education process . 

 2 . Selection : The tool I selected is Visualisation tool . This is a tool which allows you to think and 

 visualize in your mind all the possibilities . The usage of this tool allows one to think in a non   verbal way . The usage of his tool gets better by practice . This tools helps to visualise all the   possible outcomes and solutions which are associated with a particular challenge .   Refrence   <URL> 

 innovation / lecture / <ID> / visualization - tool 

 3 . Application : 

 First I sat alone with chart papers and pencils and started to find out the aspects of my   challenge . There were 2 aspects I got visualise , one how to involve the regular students in   my inclusive education and secondly how to help the specially abled students come out of   their shell . I visualized that I can ask the class representatives to help me . I also visualised   the challenges of the specially abled student which included difficulty in learning and speaking   English , hard subjects , peer pressure , form filling , writing exams , scribe etc . Now I spoke to   the class rep and the class spoke to other students in groups and all were convinced to   support . It was decided that every week one new student will sit with the differently abled   student in the class and helping them in the studies , this   student will clarify their doubts , so   this was weekly buddy . We made buddies for every task . English buddy helped them with   coping up for English related issues . Exam buddy helped with problems of finding scribe and   filling forms . There was a lunch buddy who would facilitate their movement to washroom during   lunch time and also help in getting food This way these 2 students became the responsibility   of the entire class . And I am planning to continue this pattern . These students are now   comfortable , not scared at all and the entire class has owned the responsibility . 

 4 . Insight : 

 The insight I got is that how visualisation can be done . I had to step into the shoes of the   specially able students and understand the problems as they would face it . 

 5 . Approach : 

 Next time also I would follow it the same way , maybe I will add another tool to it say story   telling . This story of my current class has become a winning story which could be told to the   future student s to come . Also my visualisation Pattern will differ If the students under   consideration are different . Say for example if I get a student who is hearing impaired I may   need another sets of visulisation

"Reflection - Learning launch 

 Challenge     The grocery store where I worked during my internship got many requests for adding   alcohol - free products , e.g. , alcohol - free ciders & beers , to their selection . As a health- conscious store , they eagerly answered the clients ' demands but soon discovered that those   products ' sales were relatively low compared to their expectations based on the number of   requests . The store now faced a challenge in improving the sales of those products with an   easy and low - cost solution .      Selection     To solve the issue the store was having , I chose the learning launch tool as the selected tool .   Due to the budget restrictions and time sensitivity , the learning launch tool seemed to be   the best tool suited to handle the challenge . That was because the learning launch allows   the store to quickly test the experimental ideas and get instant feedback on whether the   idea was a good solution or give possible ideas for a better solution .      Application     We decided to test an idea that came up during the ideation session . The idea was inspired   by new products promotion we had seen a lot . Often , when new products are coming out ,   the companies would set up tables in different stores for food samples to promote their   new product .         To use that idea as a possible solution , we looked up when were the most popular times for   people to buy alcohol , and as we suspected , the highest sales were Wednesday to Saturday   evenings and the night before a holiday . We decided to set up a table for sample testing of   the alcohol - free products around those popular hours near the alcohol products section . To   promote the acquired alcohol - free products , our personnel handling the sample tasting   table . They used the feedback that we originally got when clients requested the products to   attract people to the sample tasting table . E.g. , alcohol - free cider is healthier and also helps   people who don't / can't drink to feel more included .          During those alcohol - free products sample testing sessions , we noticed a definite spike in   sales , but we also saw that a lot of customers were asking where they could find the   products in the store , which made us realize that having the current product arrangement   was not helping the sales of the products . Based on the realization , we decided to move all   the alcohol - free products to a new location . We made sure that they had appropriate signs   to attract customers and noticed additional overall sales improvement .        Insight 

 From the learning launch tool test , we confirmed the opportunity to use ideas from other   fields to solve the specific needs that we had regarding certain products . Based on the   results , we could say that the learning launch tool served its purpose and helped find a   solution for our challenge . In addition to that , we also got additional ideas to further   improvements that we had not anticipated .      Approach     The learning launch tool was definitely the correct tool for the challenge we had , we have   used it before , and I would use the same tool the next time when I 'm asked to handle a   similar challenge . The store has continuous feedback coming straight from the customers ,   and we have also always used a mind mapping tool to get the ideas that could serve as   possible solutions for challenges .

"Learning Launch - When Shutting Up Helps Innovation 

 I am a Sr . Program Manager in a Finance IT shop for a very large corporation .   We help other Finance   teams through process automation or bringing them into the 21st century as I like to say .   I chose   <NAME> <NAME> as my tool because the theme of finding ideas to solve a problem and using unique   thought processes , data and experiments to confirm the solution is useful .   This type of design thinking   fits with a project I am currently working on .     The Challenge   A stakeholder directive to reduce headcount needs in a department which joined our organization last   year .   Within three months people would be moving to different organizations and contractors let go .    What I knew : they managed large quantities of data and interacted with a billing system in a manual   way .   What I did n’t know :   How exactly they spent their time .     I asked for a time / work study from the team director .   Mapping the team ’s time to their work functions   and flow , my initial thought(idea ) was we could automate inputting data into the billing system by   expanding a protocol we had successfully used in the past . This could not be a cookie cutter solution   though ; this team ’s work was performed in a system we no access to ( risk and possible disconfirming   fact ) . I had been told by the team director that previous automation attempts had failed because the   work was too complex ( risk and possible disconfirming fact ) .   This solution needed to go beyond the   standard elements of automation and be equal to or faster and more accurate then what the team   currently did themselves . This idea could meet the directive challenge and be better than the current   alternative .      I told the stakeholders ( Director and VP ) I had an idea to pursue . I was given a small development team   to explore its merits .   The target team director provided a resource ( and skeptic ) to work with us .     Brainstorming Optimization   I set up meetings with my developers - all with different skills and specialties . Generally , I am quite   verbal , which can mute the brilliant person who does n’t like to speak off the cuff .   So , instead of   directing the team in how I thought this problem should be resolved , I tried something different - I shut   up . As the curator , I gave the team a focus ( the specific need and the idea ) . I left space for others to   contribute , leveraging their expertise and differences .   The ideas flew - nothing was bad , it just may not   have been right as a solution .   It was a lesson learned for me and one I am trying to incorporate more   and more .     A workflow to shorten the time and attention it takes to consistently make correct , appropriate changes   to thousands ( and sometimes millions ) of customer accounts emerged .   The solution was scalable ,   addressed the work complexities and the client could view the process and make last minute changes if   necessary . On paper , if we could get billing system access , this solution could achieve the automation   and headcount savings being asked for .   Aha ! Design thinking !   We now needed to get stakeholder   approval to move on to designing and experimenting with the process .     Presenting the Solution   Our presentation was cobbled together .   We reviewed the workflow and showed pieces of other   projects that had some similar moving parts . We described how one section of work would flow into the   next and the ability the client would have to control the data . This was unlike work we had done before ,   but it could end up being a pathway for many other teams in the future .   Our napkin pitch was clumsy 

 but it did the job . The apprehensive client team director could see the possibility for success .   Our   leadership knew our capabilities and approved our next move - to build and test the idea .     Confirming the Results   We had reached Wow . We got the billing system access needed and what has been developed is being   tested for release next month .   Trials are showing we can take a large amount of data and using   automation input it correctly into multiple layers of a highly complex billing system .   We will reach the   headcount reduction requested and an even higher percentage of time savings than previously   predicted . If I was going to do something differently , next time I would ask for more client input upfront .    This would have helped sharpen the focus on the issue to be solved more quickly .

"Motivating Reflection Visualization examples ; 

 Insight and Existing our <NAME> ; 

 Our answer tends to the issue of supporting reflection - on - activity . Our work is enlivened by   Schön‟s conceptualization of reflection - on - activity and broadens it by recognizing how the   intellectual demonstration of reflection converts into explicit plan exercises by and by . By   considering designers‟ reflection practice , we hypothesized that a visual portrayal of plan   antiquities that catches and conveys the plan cycle and setting of plan movement would   better cultivate reflection - on - activity . To approve our methodology , we planned , actualized ,   and assessed Reflection , an intelligent perception instrument for supporting exercises   related with reflection - on - activity . Assessment of Reflection with proficient originators   indicated both subjective and quantitative advantages of our approach . There are a few key   advancements in ReflectionSpace . To start with , Reflection upholds reviewing plan stories ,   understanding the progression of configuration , contrasting various undertakings , assessing   time contributed , and finding covered up 

 designs . Second , Reflection offers a period and movement driven perception of plan 

 materials that can be explored at various degrees of detail . 

 Application of the matter ; 

 Reflection - on - activity is a basic segment of innovative plan . It empowers creators to assess   their plan cycle , gain from past victories and disappointments , and increase motivation which   thusly can improve plan productivity and results . For instance , a visual creator may   participate in a "" self - assessment "" meeting subsequent to finishing the plan of a site and find   out if the last plan met customer prerequisites , regardless of whether she pre - maturely   dedicated to a model , or whether this venture took longer than other website composition   extends that she dealt with . Dissimilar to appearance in real life which empowers   in - the - second considering plan action , reflection - onaction empowers basic contemplating   earlier activities comprehensively . While not so much regular but rather more granular than   appearance in real life , reflection - on - activity is similarly significant for improving plan results .   This roused us to inspect conduct identified with reflection - on - activity , assemble an intuitive   representation device that bolsters this conduct , and assess its effect on reflection for   genuine plan ventures . Existing antiques assume an indispensable function in innovative   plan - creators use existing curios to figure the plan issue , produce thoughts , and assess   options . Studies affirm that creators frequently access earlier scenes ( encounters ) when   tested with new issues .

 Introducing the Reflection Activity 

 During a study abroad experience , students worked on a collaborative design project with international   peers . The purpose of this design project was to provide students with meaningful international   experiences . At three points in the project , students reflected on their experience working in a cross- cultural team . The purpose of these reflection activities was for students to look back on their   experiences , learn from them , and be prepared for future similar experiences . Three times throughout   the quarter , students were asked to reflect on their experience working on a project in a cross - cultural   team . In the first reflection , students reflected on their interests and goals within their field of study and   how those connected to the course . The purpose of this reflection was to set the stage for the course   and students ’ experiences in cross - cultural teams . In the second reflection , students reflected on how   they saw the project and the intercultural collaboration , and how these related to their learning . The   purpose of this reflection was for students to pause a few weeks into their work and see what they had   learned and make any necessary adjustments for the rest of the course . In the final reflection at the end   of the quarter , students reflected on their overall experience . The purpose of the final reflection was to   support students in looking back at their experience and thinking about what they had accomplished   and how it connected to their future . After each reflection assignment was submitted , the teaching   team read the individual reflections of each of the teams they were mentoring and provided feedback to   that team . The reflection assignment was graded on whether the student did the assignment and on the   depth of the reflection using levels of reflection by <NAME> <NAME> and Chike Smith : Descriptive Writing ,   Descriptive Reflection , <NAME> <NAME> , and Critical Reflection1 . Students were asked to write at the   last two levels ( and were given indicators for each level , so they could judge for themselves ) .   Additionally , the Red educator read all of the Red students ’ reflections because their reflections were a   component of their grade for the course . In terms of outcomes , there was potential for students to   better understand cross - cultural communication . After engaging in this reflection activity , students may   better understand working on a large - scale open - ended group project , and how the project benefitted   the client and society . 

 Recreating the Reflection Activity 

 Description 

 •   1 Introduce the reflection activities to the students at the start of the trip . 

 •   2 Read the reflections and provide each team with feedback . 

 •   3 Read the reflections of the students from your respective institution for grading . 

 In the words of the Educator : 

 Remind students to submit their reflections . Students often forget to submit their assignment for 

 various reasons . It helps to remind them of the due date . 

 Support students ’ cross cultural communication . The first week of the course is spent as a cross - cultural   seminar . This week sets the stage for the first reflection activity and provides students with important   information as they begin their cross - cultural team projects . 

 Ask students to report on the team dynamics . I 've frequently asked my students to give me feedback   on the team dynamics . But it ’s only because I 'm not there to observe that on a daily or even a weekly   basis . I get to see the end product as a presentation in class or a project implementation or a project 

 report , but it does n’t tell me how the team dynamics work or how well the members work . 

 What was the inspiration for the reflection activity ? I started implementing these reflection activities   because the Swedish part of the teaching team suggested these activities . They sounded like a great fit   for our goals for the students ’ experiences

"Challenge & Selection 

 I have been assigned to work with experienced professionals in the area of Manufacturing Parks 

 Development to establish a new section concerned and governing the Industrial parks development in the 

 city and to activate the organization mandate related to the this jurisdiction as specified in the establishment 

 law of this organization by introducing business processes , procedures , daily activities , projects and 

 stakeholder engagement strategy that reflects the organization position in the government structure . 

 There are 3 aspects that makes the challenge very difficult to handle . The first one is the top management 

 has no knowledge and expertise in this area and can not establish a relation with the professionals that 

 doing the job already due to the gap between business , management and technical perspectives , so there 

 is lack of direction and miscommunication . The second one is those professionals are sticking to their 

 informal way of performing the job and being in their comfort zone and do n’t want anyone to enter their 

 peaceful territory . The third one is that I have no deep knowledge of that area but had a deep experience 

 in establishing teams and sections . 

 The selected tool for the challenge is the Mind Map tool . The mind map is a technique to write down the 

 information and ideas in a certain context that shows the relation between those information or ideas and 

 how they are actually connected , it ’s specifically a technique to maps out the ideas . It uses words , lines , 

 symbols , pictures , colors or shapes to organize information or thoughts without certain order or sequence 

 but mainly centered and rooted to the main subject . It looks similar to a tree base with many branches , the 

 base of the tree is the main subject and the branches are the information of the ideas related to that main 

 subject . 

 Initially I need to understand the connections and relationship of their current activities to the responsibilities 

 specified by the law , this is see how thing connected and interconnected . 

 Application 

 I have used the mind mapping tool mainly to understand how thing are connected and interconnected in 

 this area of business by discussing with the professionals about how things been done and what is actually 

 happening in terms of activities . By using the mind mapping I tried to list the main responsibilities which 

 supposed to be performed by the section depending on the law and link what is happing currently in reality 

 with that given responsibilities by the law . 

 The drawn mind map been verified by the professionals after multiple attempts to address all the facts . For 

 the responsibilities that have never been performed , a brainstorming session conducted with the 

 professionals to come up with the activities and project to be performed by the section to activate those non 

 active responsibilities . The final mind map presented to the top management to align them to actual reality 

 and get their approval and direction on the actual activities and the proposed one too based on their 

 strategic objectives . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The mind map tool helped a lot in understanding the whole picture and it helped to bridge the gap between 

 the management and the professionals . The management become more aware of what is happening and 

 what they need to manage . The professionals started to feel relaxed after they notice that the management 

 started to understand the nature of their duties and the challenges they face . 

 When the assignment given to me I felt very stressed due to the lack of my expertise in their core area , but 

 after drawing the mind map I become more aware that the real requirement to establish the business 

 processes for the section is to rearrange current activities , proper management and formulation of 

 procedures , activities and projects and put in a systematic context and integrate it into the used system in 

 the organization . 

 If I had to the do the same exercise again , I will combine the visualization tool with the mind map . Both mind 

 map and visualization tools can create a clear perspective and easy to explain and understand especially 

 for the matter of no existence of mutuality or common understanding .   A mind map can be considered as 

 visual representation of the ideas and by replacing words , statements , processes or lines with actual 

 representation by using images can lead to optimum understanding of the issue .

"Challenge :    An Auto Manufacturing plant has several production unit and assembly lines , namely- Engine   Foundry , Engine Assembly , Transmission Assembly , Vehicle Assembly etc . All these production   processes are very energy intensive process . Among these , <NAME> <NAME> was the most   Energy Intensive due to the working for 2 Electric Furnaces . Since the plant was not equipped   with cutting edge Data Acquisition Systems , there was no visibility whether the processes were   executed at optimum efficiency . There were old PLC and SCADA systems but the data was   stored in disparate stand alone computers . As a result , collection of data for reporting and   optimisation process was a painstaking task for the Foundry Managers and <NAME> <NAME> . Any   form of optimisation leading to cost saving required installation of a centralised data aggregation   platform with proper analytics tools and proper visualisation to ease the decision making   process .    Problems & their Impact : 

 1 . Lack of visibility of the foundry process .    2 . No Centralised database for real - time analysis , visualisation reporting and decision 

 making . 

 3 . Increased cost due to less efficient processes .    4 . Low productivity of the unit leading to less output of the plant 

 Foundry process included , 

 •   Loading the scrap metals cubes from the trucks into the bins 

 •   Creating a mix of scrap metals along with aluminium and other metals 

 •   adding them to the furnace for the melting cycle to begin 

 •   once molten , the metal is then transported to the foundry machine where the hot metal is   poured into sand moulds to form engine blocks 

 •   these blocks are then cured , hardened and polished . 

 Insights :      Energy wastage happens during the starting - melting - holding and idle times of the furnace . This   wastage leads to increased cost and reduced energy efficiency as well as productivity of the   plant . 

 •   Smart Energy meters were connected at the source transformers and power lines which   supplied the furnaces , machines and other peripheral loads of the foundry unit . 

 •   These meters are then connected to a network of controllers and data aggregators which   sent the data(electrical parameters ) to a common database . 

 •   This enabled the analytics team to fetch real - time data with 1 second interval . 

 •   Data collected included , current , voltages , power , energy , power factor , frequency and 21   others . 

 •   There was a total of 32 such data points generating 672 data points / second 

 •   The data when populated in the data base allowed the team to plot the entire process on   a real - time basis and compare the same to the theoretical process suggested . 

 •   Parameters like power / energy / current / voltages etc showed when the furnaces and   machine are idle , and what efficiency are they working at . This was then correlated with   process cycle- "" Cold start of furnace , melting cycle , holding cycle and refill cycle "" with   time on the x - axis 

 •   This exposed shortcomings of the processes like - human interventions , overstretched   breaks , careless operations of the furnaces(like heating of empty furnaces , filling up cold   furnaces etc . ) 

 •   The shortcomings identified in the analysis were validated by the ground operations team   during the "" gemba "" . 

 •   Root cause analysis of the "" human intervention "" problem was done using 5 - Why   methodology and it was found that , "" The scrap material cube sourced from the 

 supplier were bigger than the instructed dimension . This took more time to melt in   the furnace . The operator had to chip the cubes and break them into smaller   pieces which took more time . "" All this while the Furnace was kept in cold start   mode which consumed energy . 

 Application : 

 •   The scrap metal supplier was fined for violating the SLA and was asked to comply   with the norms . 

 •   The operators and ground workers were made aware of the new process and the   monitoring system which increased their work efficiency . 

 •   The extended breaks were cut down . 

 •   These combined steps led to an overall reduction in energy consumption by 15 % and   overall cost reduction by 17 % which translated to roughly 7 lac INR per month . 

 •   The reporting in now done on a single click instead of manual records which saved 720   man - hours / month . 

 •   The visibility of the entire data has increased the speed of decision making process due   to attractive n yet informative graphs and charts . 

 •   The entire project broke even with 3 months . 

 Approach : 

 •   The new stricter SLA was drafted for the scrap metal supplier and the consignment was   now received with proper quality assurance documentation from the supplier side . 

 •   The processes are regularly audited . 

 •   The supervisors are trained to use the monitoring dashboard to identify and report   anomalies and generate production reports , cost reports , billing and consumption of   energy all through the portal . 

 •   The senior management like the foundry head and plant head are given access and   training to the executive level view of the portal which help them in fast decision making 

 •   The ground team is backed by a tech team with IT which provides 24x7 support for   issues on the portal and a vendor partner who is available on call of the maintenance of   the meters and the controllers .

"REFLECTION : STORYTELLING 

 Challenge & Selection 

 During my time with a Welfare Organization , I was working with a team who set up a camp in a village . I   was given the task of connecting with villagers and explain to them the importance of education for   their children . In villages , parents prefer their children to help them in daily chores instead of sending   their kids to school . It was my task to help them realize that sending their kids to school is much more   beneficial for the children rather than working in the fields . The strategy used to communicate and   understand them was that I first started with the story so that they can know what I am trying to tell   them . After the story ends , I gathered the feedbacks to understand their problems and help them in   understanding how they can overcome those problems and situations . By doing this , I help them in   creating a bright future for their children . 

 Application 

 I have a story to share about using storytelling in this situation . While helping the villagers in   understanding the importance of education for their children , one of the points I wanted them to realize   that knowledge can help their children to make better decisions and choices even if they 're going to   farm in the future . I told them a story about a friend of mine who was born into a family of farmers . His   father always wanted him to take over after him . The father did n't receive any formal education .   Traders and merchants always fooled him in selling the crop at a lower price or in buying bad crop   seeds . He always felt that not getting a formal education was a significant disadvantage , and he did n't   want his son to suffer the same way as he did . 

 Insight & Approach 

 He sent his son to school . The son graduated from school with flying colors and joined a college where   he learned more about farming methods and crops . After completing his education , he came home and   took over his father 's field . He used new ways to irrigate the fields , which resulted in lesser use of water .   He also started sowing different crops and different ways of planting crops . He also started farming off- season vegetables . He even bargained well with the merchants and bought good quality of crops from   traders . This change in farming soon started benefitting the family . His father felt proud of his son and   was happy seeing his son doing way better than he could ever have . 

 I told this story to the villagers , and it had a significant impact on them . I also received valuable   feedback , which helped me in understanding some of the problems they faced and their mindset . 

 I believe storytelling is a way to make people better understand what you are trying to convey , and it   sometimes serves as a tool to understand some of the problems which people hide . But after hearing   the story , they open up .

"Designing ONe Wallet Solution 

 Reflection on Visualization and Learning Launch 

 Challenge & Selection     The bank in which I am currently serving as one of the Digital Business Lead has been trying to find an   effective solution to serve the lower - mass segment that comes with the upper - level segments the bank is   focusing on .   We already had some ideas and ideal conditions that we should have to meet the best   interest of all stakeholders involved , the challenge is however to devise and develop the most effective   product , along with the roadmap of how the bank should leverage on this product in the future .     To provide a bit of a context on the challenge at hand , the bank currently has one third of its savings   account opened as payroll accounts for blue - collar workers at minimum - wage range of salaries .   The bank   has its top reputation in serving corporate customers that have thousands of blue - collar workers in their   factories .   Business - wise , the target segment for the bank is the corporate and the individuals working in   that corporation that belong to what we identify as Emerging Affluent and Affluent segments .   However ,   in order to serve the target segment , we need to be able to serve the lower - mass segment that comes   with the package .   The challenge with this specific segment is that they are not considered profitable to   the bank .   Therefore , the bank embarked on a mission to improve how the bank would serve this specific   segment that should be measured in terms of cost and process efficiencies .     In order to devise a solid proposal and roadmap , we realized that the key is to develop a strong product ,   versatile and flexible enough for the bank to serve the intended segment , while still maintaining focus on   the main target segment .   We figured , once the most - fitted product is in place , aligning supporting   environments and activities should be more manageable .       Thus , I decided to kick - off a product designing process with Visualization tool as the main tool , leading to   Learning Launch sequences until we would make the product work the best to the mission .   In addition ,   during the process of designing , <NAME> <NAME> has been one of our most valuable tools in aligning all   stakeholders ’ perspective and providing a map for us to stay on track .   However , the reflection would be   on the emphasis of the Visualization tool that helped us building the cornerstones of this product .     Application     At the beginning , we already had a hypothesis that the most suitable product for the challenging segment   is the electronic money ( e - money ) .   The real challenge at hand is to devise the characteristics of our own   e - money in the amidst of other dominating e - money issuers in the market , while at the same time   answering concerns from the highest - level in the bank toward the effectiveness of having an e - money in   the bank ’s product portfolio .     The process was started with a workshop that involved the directly involved stakeholders consisting of   Digital Business , Operations & IT , Business Banking and Marketing .   The Project Management Office ( PMO )   assisted as the facilitator over the whole process .   We started by defining and constructing the problem   statement . 

 The Visualization tools began its effectiveness since the very beginning of the process .   We defined and   collected all necessary information on the “ What Is ” situation .   Besides collecting readily available primary   data , we dig a little bit deeper by collecting secondary , qualitative data from extended stakeholders and   even the customers themselves .   We divided the workshop participants into four groups , each   representing the said main functions , but each group itself consisted of group members from different   functional team .   For example , there was a group focusing on product management ( the function of Digital   Business team ) , and the group was consisted of members from each of different functional team .   Same   applied to the other three groups .     We considered the first process quite successful as we managed to map all the current situation , complete   with all the aspects had been considered good , those had been the challenges , and those had always been   in the wish list of commercial team but not yet available bank wide .   Visualization helped us see the   situation more clearly and keep all the different functions on the same perspective throughout the   process .   Problem statement was then constructed and agreed upon by all the stakeholders .     The second session was fully dedicated to the designing process .   With the problem statement at hand ,   we started the second process with identifying closely the characteristics and behaviors of the targeted   segment .   Here , we created personas to represent the categories of users of the solution , from the main   target , to several secondary target market .   We heavily used Visualization tools and aids during the   process , from the pictures of real customers that fall to each of categories , to illustrations of how they   would make use of the solution throughout their activities .   Besides Visualization , we also partly use <NAME>   Telling as an aid to construct our personas .   It was an exhaustive process , but we managed to narrow   down the categories from nine to only four , The Worker , The Overseer , The Companion and The <NAME> .    Conclusively we locked that four categories as our main persona for this specific solution .     Then the next day came with the third session , defining the customer journey with the solution .   Again ,   Visualization aids were proven the most effective tool in this stage .   We defined the journeys for the four   categories , and at the end of the session , we managed to create the single journey for all categories .   The   decision became the customer journey from first onboarding to interacting with the solution and even   further to attrition .   We managed to squeeze - in additional journey when the customers would have been   entering the attrition phase , which would have further led to cross - selling opportunities or actual attrition .     The result of our third session were further processed by our third - party agency to produce user   interface / user experience design .   They then proposed by A - B Testing to the board of management ( later   in the following processes ) .   The fourth session was the conclusive session to design how we would design   the suitable proposition to the customers .   Visualization was still a valuable tool in this stage , besides Mind   Mapping that we extensively used to explore possibilities and to determine what could work and what   not .   Reflecting to the course , this would be when we defined ‘ What Work ’ after the ‘ What Wow ’ session   during the customer journey session , and ‘ What If ’ session during the product designing .       Insight & Approach     I learnt a lot from this course , and surprisingly very relevant and applicable to the real designing activities   in my work ( and I am now also convinced it is applicable to all in general as well ) .   Based on my experience ,   even when I personally was n’t completely literate of the step - by - step design thinking , we have done the   concept throughout our processes and we have proven its effectiveness so far . 

 Having learnt design thinking , I will use the concept and the framework throughout the designing activities   in my line of work , as well as encouraging the team to learn more of design thinking concept for their own   successful works .       Continuing the process , we are now in the process of making <NAME> <NAME> for the solution we named   ONe Wallet .   The overall product circles around a server - based electronic money application , with its   supporting environment and processes to serve the lower - mass segment , while on the other hand   creating a currently one - of - a - kind proposition to business banking in <ADDRESS> by the bank I ’m working   for .    We have set several metrics and test scenarios to quickly measure some of the elements of the   products , and to quickly make revisions or improvements based on the result in the next release .   We are   now running on a one - month sprints of development , and we will release the first working version to   limited public by March 2014 before going largely on April 2012 .     Even further , we are now planning to have several small launches after the initial launch that would have   signified small incremental improvements in the solution .   The improvements may not always upon the   ONe Wallet application but can be on the supporting process and environment .   For example , we already   have a roadmap at hand to launch supporting tools in the internet banking platform .     Going forward , I have already been working with my team upon the design thinking framework as well as   the tools .   We make it a habit to always have discussions with the aids of Visualization and <NAME> <NAME> ,   and to construct a process or a solution with <NAME> <NAME> .   Since we have been operating with Agile   mindset and Scrum methodology , the Learning Launches have become our way of working as well .

"Assignment 1 

 Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 A. Challenge : 

 I am a Project Engineer in one of the Oil and Gas company . During one of the Oil and Gas 

 project , we were at the stage of pre - commissioning activities have initiated and are getting 

 completed system by system . After completion of pre - commissioning activities commissioning 

 activities were scheduled . However , there was a protocol to conduct internal as well as 

 external ( peer review ) technical audit of the installed facilities before the commissioning and 

 start - up is initiated . During the technical audit one of the most renowned audit engineer , who 

 had performed technical audits for several oil and gas facilities across the globe for last 30 

 years had pointed out a very minute error that seal cooling liquid to all the installed centrifugal 

 pumps is not a controlled flow . As a best engineering practice , it was recommended to install 

 flow restriction orifice in all the seal cooling liquid inlet lines . 

 Based on the recommendation suppliers were contacted to provide some 50 nos of flow 

 restriction orifice on urgent basis . Most of the suppliers replied with the minimum delivery 

 period of 3 months subject to various overriding considerations and exorbitantly high cost . 

 Challenge was to install the recommended item and start the plant at the earliest to save lot 

 of service cost being paid on daily basis and start the earning wheel . 

 B. Tool Selection : 

 After looking at the situation I had carried out calculations to know the restriction orifice hole 

 size required for the installation and proposed to my leaders to locally fabricate the orifice if 

 possible . Broadly speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea 

 and prototype . There for the requirement to identify the fabricator was like a learning launch 

 to locally manage such issues . 

 C. Application : 

 After getting nod from our managers and leaders sketch or orifice was prepared by our 

 draftsmen and a team of 2 shop floor supervisors were sent to various fabricators to check 

 whether it is possible to quickly fabricate the restriction orifice . To which most of the fabricators 

 said yes but they were pre - occupied with work which they were awarded by various clients 

 and they were willing to do it after completion of ongoing work and it was expected to get 

 completed in 3 - 4 weeks ’ time . Which we can not afford to wait . Finally , one of the fabricator 

 who had capability to do such fine works was ready to take the job and deliver the product in 

 2 days ’ time . There came the next challenge when he informed that he does not have 2 mm 

 to 4 mm stainless steel plate with him and it will take min 2 weeks ’ time to arrange the plate . 

 We have come back to our ware house to locate a stainless - steel plate , fortunately we have 

 located a 4 mm thick stainless - steel plate of 1 square meter size . We took permissions to lift 

 the plate and transport it to the fabricator . Plate was delivered to fabricator and in presence 

 of floor supervisors ’ plate was cut into desired size pieces . There was a requirement of 50 

 nos , where to avoid any failure a 20 % contingency was considered and 60 nos restriction 

 orifice were fabricated in just one day with the fabrication cost of merely Rupees 5K. This has 

 saved couple of hundred thousand Rupee and time of 3 months . 

 D. Insight & Approach : 

 By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified and learned that there are some 

 fabricators available in the nearby area are capable in performing such fine fabrication works . 

 Moving forward , our team who will operate the plant had decided to review such opportunities 

 in future at least as a stop gap arrangement , whenever there are such sourcing issues . 

 In view of above the learning launch is the appropriate tool used to overcome the issue . As 

 mentioned above , our team needs to review the insight gained from this learning launch and 

 incorporate this insight into future projects . 

"
"Challenge 

 I was working on an initiative called “ lab of the future ” for my manufacturing business ( Labs ) . Our   business has Product quality labs across the globe , and each Lab caters to different sorts of   products and therefore has different business processes . The management felt that our labs were   highly inefficient , especially in terms of where we were in our Digitalization journey and the pace   of initiatives we had undertaken . For all these <NAME> , my ask was to define a Lab of the future   vision and come with clearly defined actions in short to long term that would bring in real value   to our labs and will impact their top or bottom line . The key challenge was to clearly understand   “ what did lab of the future mean for my stakeholders ” and generate ideas that would bring a   competitive advantage to us .     Selection 

 The mind mapping tool was a precise fit , especially when I was trying to generate different ideas   and arrive on common , agreed design principles ( something we needed before moving to   brainstorm possible solutions or initiatives that the <NAME> needed to undertake ) . The lab managers   ( key stakeholders ) were the key participants as I believed they held all that was out there to be   thought ( and done ) , and it was just a case of trying to bring all those ideas to one platform and   understand the connections . 

 Application 

 To prepare for mind mapping workshop , i did a lot of prework – starting with creating the design   brief , resource plan , etc . – to collect all the information through interviews , surveys , etc .   and   prepare an exhaustive source of information ( all the feedback ) .    With all the data now collected , the next step was to start the mind mapping process – the intent   was not to accept or discard any ideas but see the commonalities between these ideas and arrive   on design criteria .     To get the process started , I then arranged for a one - day workshop with all these stakeholders   ( 13 ) . The workshop was distributed in three parts over the day . To begin with - On the big   workshop room - wall , I had put all the inputs collected from within and external resources for our   stakeholders to see .   Each of the stakeholders was asked to take his or her time to go through all   the propositions that were on that wall and choose ideas they liked or thought would inform   other ideas . Each stakeholder was asked to do this individually .      In the second half , the stakeholders then , in a group of four , started putting their sticky notes to   a board into clustered themes ( as they seem fit ) , and the rest of the members tried to put their   notes around these themes as well . As we progressed further , these themes , after a lot of   deliberations , discussions gave way to critical insights that the group eventually agreed should   be taken as the design criteria for our next exercise of brainstorming the possible solutions . 

 Insight 

 The primary purpose of using the mind mapping tool was to generate the design criteria that we   would use to establish our brainstorming sessions . With this exercise , all the observations that   the participants made were turned into insights statements that implied what the conditions that   our plausible solutions ( which was part of the second half of the 2nd and 3rd portions of the workshop and 

 not included here ) must satisfy were . 

 Stakeholders , at the end of the day , confirmed that the mind mapping exercise was a very   effective way to capture all the observations , remove a lot of confirmation biases , and explore a   much broader set of possibilities . 

 Please note : I have not included the specific insights for the reasons of confidentiality as those were   data that our team eventually used 

 Approach      Learning launch , I believe , would be another critical tool that I intend to use in the next stage for   launching small prototypes quickly and gather the feedback . I think it could be a highly useful   tool , especially when trying to understand and prioritize initiatives that should be scaled . 

"
"1 ) Select one of the four design thinking tools presented in the course ( listed 

 below ) that you are interested in applying to a challenge of your choice . 

 StoryTelling 

 2 ) Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 I work with a sustainable e - commerce retailer . Despite environmental concern 

 and cheap labor costs , consumers still love fast fashion . Customers are not 

 likely to change their shopping habits out of concern for the environment or 

 ethical workforce . 

 3 ) Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what 

 it is and why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate 

 video lecture references ) . 

 I have chosen story telling as one of the four design thinking tools presented in 

 the course . Storytelling is a fundamental part of every great brand . Within an 

 organization , storytelling can act as a carrier for messages , assist in reinforcing 

 cultural values or transform into a powerful persuasive tool . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge 

 ( e.g. , what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 The first and foremost thing that I did was ​get to know my audience . Me and 

 my team did my research on who our targeted audience was , ​understood the 

 audience before we wrote our story and decided where to distribute it . Who are 

 they ? What are their biggest wants and fears ? More importantly : Why should 

 they care about us ? 

 Talk to existing customers to understand their pain points and why they buy 

 from us already or why have they not considered buying from us . 

 We did this through quantitative customer surveys . Online reviews also provide 

 insight into what our customers wanted , thought , and feel about our brand . 

 4 ) Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to 

 your challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the 

 challenge and about design thinking more broadly ) . 

 Right now sustainable fashion just is n't happening at the scale it needs to . 

 According to our research , we found out that shopping priority , price 

 sensitivity , thoughts of greenwashing , and low influence that sustainable labels 

 have are the most important reasons why sustainable shopping is struggling on 

 the market . Buying sustainably is often presented as something lifestyle 

 influencers and celebrities do . 

 <NAME> sustainable fashion brands price their products beyond the average 

 consumer ’s budget , which makes it harder especially for younger generations 

 ( like those in Gen Z ) to afford and adopt sustainable fashion practices . 

 Furthermore , based on our findings , the main quality the consumer looks for in 

 a garment is style and design . which is most valued , even when considering a 

 sustainable garment . 

 5 ) Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the 

 same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 Our social conscious story will not only be on our site but also across videos and 

 other social platforms . We will share behind - the - scenes videos of the 

 photoshoots and video shoots , how the clothes are sourced and the 

 manufacturing process , entertaining stories and contents , etc . This way our 

 consumers will get to know would give them a great story to tell whenever they 

 wore the clothing line . 

 We will answer various questions such as , ` ` Why did we start our business ? 

 How will it solve a problem for customers or the world ? Why should they care ? 

 Then continue to tell the story in different ways . 

 Another way to use integrated storytelling to sell your products is to immerse 

 customers in new digital experiences . We shall also release online versions of 

 an e - magazine , featuring all our designs and articles on outfit and styling 

 ideas , how - to articles , etc . It is actually a clickable magazine that allows 

 consumers to shop right from the page . It helps them see our brand from a 

 fresh perspective . 

 Collaborate with celebrities and influencers to tell our brand ’s story and 

 initiative for us . The aim is to create content that appeals to the aspirational 

 lifestyle of its customers and an opportunity to get more eyeballs on our brand 

 that advocates for sustainable choices . If we have content that has real 

 meaning , people are more likely to click and go look at the actual product . If we 

 can try and get across our brand message and make people feel inspired or 

 motivated , then they might   go and buy our product . 

 We need to make sure to use a unique voice , tone , colours and style that not 

 only speaks to our customers but reveals your brand personality .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling    challenge and selection          story telling is a great tool that i use all time.story telling is used to create a empathy betweeen product and coust mer.story telling     helps the people to get insipired.i live in a place where senior citizens and handicapped persons live the story helped   them alot to get inspired    they share stories and make others happy.storytelling is greattool that can create empathy , love , trust and also get ins pire other people    the leaders will use storytelling   to connect with the people and fill their minds with their ideas using storytelling too l.            I share stories of my life in order to help them visualize a state ofindependence , I use their feedback against the   context of my story to ascertain     their goals , andsometimes we use stories to better understand their interests and thought processes . I use thisinforma tion to develop different      strategies to try and find a way that works for them to gain moreindependence in the areas they find lacking in their   lives          Application            story telling used in many areas or sectors in organizations they use storytelling to connect their employees with th e company    to create a story their we should make a character that connect to your audience.the companies use this tool to create   a empathy    between product and the coustmer.for example back from my days in school some people come with products to sell   by telling a story    that this products sre created by handicapped childern by buying this products the handicapped people will be benfit ed the make a    empathy by saying handicapped and they say if you buy this product it will help them .          Insight & Approach          Well , wow , that was an eye - opener . Her mother was a calm presence and doing very well . Clearly it was    time for me to open up with my story . I told her how scary it was when my father had his brain    aneurysm in front of me and how I had to get him to the hospital and how difficult and scary that all    was . I shared how he recovered well , and then tied us together , by noting how she and I both have    parents who survived brain aneurysms . This worked really well . She really needed individual attention    for that brief time , and she ended up with that and a true support . She calmed down , her mother , who    had become worried about her , calmed down , and everyone around them calmed down . Peace reigned    again in our little shelter .    So I told this story to the agency , and I think it had a big impact on people there . The policies are being    reevaluated and the caseworkers are going through new training . Sometimes a little story can do a lot of    good .    This course made me see this as a tool in a new way . When I 've done it before it was really "" ad hoc , "" but     now I can prepare ahead and think of stories that will assist me in presenting my ideas and best    illuminate them .    I have a design background , but I ended up as an entrepreneur in business . I had no idea this would ever    be considered an asset , but I am so very grateful that it is !

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am part of an environmental consultancy junior company ( a company formed only by   students ) , currently I am at the operations and commercial group . Recently we faced a   problem with a client , he proposed a job beyond our area of study , so we had to search on the   internet all the information available to come up with a solution . It was exhausting because , as   said in this course , internet is full of information and it is hard to filter it . 

 Selection 

 With all the data collected we needed a tool to filter it . The more adequate tool is mind   mapping to find patterns and look for insights in the middle of all this data . 

 Application 

 Me and my team contact one of our mentor professors and he indicated a PhD professor in the   area of the client´s problem . We arranged a meeting to discuss what we had to learn and what   tools were necessary to came up with a solution in this yet “ unknown field ” . After the meeting   we were able to filter the most import data taking into consideration what the labor market   was expecting . Each person in the team shared ideas to present for our client , here we used   “ post - it ” method . After sharing ideas , we categorized and ranked them . 

 Insight 

 Applying a design thinking method ( talk to people and understand deeply the problem ) with   mind mapping ( brainstorm ideas and categorize them ) gave us a north to not get anxious   about the size of data and present an adequate solution to a problem beyond our knowledges .   The experience was also enriching in the learning process . 

 Approach 

 Visualization of the ideas proved to be highly effective , next time I would start using this tool   since the first meeting with the client , to save hours of meetings trying to explain the problem   to others .

"Storytelling and visualization 

 Selection 

 Storytelling and visualization , I think are the most important tool for progressive innovation .   Storytelling help us to convey the massage and requirement of an idea , concept or product   to our stakeholders and team mates while the tool of visualization helps us to find clarity in   our design by giving us tool to arrange and link together various information and design   ideas . As an engineering student I have came across situations in which these two tools   were very much useful . 

 Challenge 

 During a project of developing an assistant bot system to help elder people . The first   challenge I faced was to explain our sponsors idea behind our project . By using the story   telling method we were able to develop an empathy among our stake holder and convince   them for need of this project . The second challenge we faced was developing a design and   laydown the whole detail plan of manufacturing and alternative method in a systematic way   that we can link our research data and design to build better prototype . For this we used   various tool of visualization such as mind mapping , graphs and even stick drawing figures .   This tool also helped us in presenting our work to stakeholders . 

 Application 

 While presenting the concept to sponsors we told a story about a person who love his old   grand parents and how even when he wants to take care of there needs he ca n’t due to his   work life . We emphasize on factor of loneliness of elder . The story of relatable enough for   almost everyone . The various scenarios were predicted and how our bot should reaction in   each , the tools of mind mapping helped a lot during this process . 

 Insight and approach 

 During the period of entire project , I found the visualization is an essential tool in any   problem solving not just in engineering or business but also in daily life . How visualization   tool made it easier to understand the problem and even finding solution . 

 The art of storytelling was a new thing for me . But as I learn and applied storytelling I was   able to appreciate the importance of it . I thing it is the most important skill that every one   should master . It not only help to convince our stakeholders about product but also increase   our own appreciation for our own work and hence somehow motive yourself to achieve   excellences .

"Challenge 

 The challenge I applied design thinking to was report production within my office workgroup . 

 The procedure for generating a report involves compiling and processing data , analyzing and   interpreting it to derive meaning , then synthesizing the results into an easy to understand report .   Because these reports are the basis of strategic decisions by my organization ’s leadership , clarity and   accuracy are the most important aspects of production . Secondary considerations are timeliness . If   information is provided after a decision needs to be made , that information is effectively worthless . I   used journey mapping to identify areas where the process could be accelerated or condensed , without   affecting quality . 

 Selection     Journey mapping is a visualization tool that helps design thinking practitioners understand 

 “ what is ” the current state . To create a journey map , I asked workers to describe their work processes   and wrote down each individual activity . Arrows between each activity represent the flow of work .   While all steps are sequential , they do not all begin the moment the previous step ends . Capturing delay   between steps is also an important aspect of journey mapping . 

 Application     I prefer to start visualization exercises in a physical form : whiteboards , post - it notes , or large 

 sheets of paper . Whiteboards lower the perceived permanency of ideas , because anything written can   be easily erased or modified . Post - it notes are even better in my experience , because multiple people   can write their ideas simultaneously , and no ideas end up discarded . Large rolls of paper have the   advantage of being easy to set up anywhere , and easy to transport afterwards , but participants are   sometimes hesitant to write half - formed ideas for fear of ruining what ’s already been diagrammed .   Whatever physical representation is chosen to initiate the visualization exercise , converting it to a digital   format is important for archiving and referencing in the future . Powerpoint is my choice for digitizing   journey maps . 

 Insight     I conducted an hour - long meeting with the relevant subject matter experts , and produced a 

 current state map of the production process . We compared this actual state to an ideal production   workflow , and some insights emerged . We were conducting some quality checks too late in the process ,   which required corrections to flow backward through multiple steps . This wasted time and effort could   be eliminated fairly easily by re - ordering our order of operations . Implementing these steps did not   speed up the normal workflow process , but it did significantly improve how quickly defects could be   corrected . 

 Alternative Approach     An alternative approach I could have used was to ask production workers what their ideal 

 journey map would look like , essentially doing a clean - sheet redesign instead of an incremental   improvement . This approach is attractive to me because of the potential for exponential improvement ,   but clean - sheet design is very disruptive to existing business practice . Unless there is a clear need to do   so , or a need is created , disruptive innovation will not be the first choice for many business managers .   That said , journey mapping is a useful tool for all types of innovative efforts . 

"
"​Visualization     > Challenge and Selection   The tool which I found most interesting among all the four tools is   visualization . I use this approach of Visualization or Visual thinking broadly   while working with my father , in front of his customers who are private   agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission   or the delivery of their services to their customers , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens ,   businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the technique of using a straw man   visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for    discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in   the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships   between elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities   for improvements or solutions .      > Application   I applied this tool of design thinking i.e. , Visualization or virtual thinking to   every best possible way I can do . And it is now in my habit to apply it in real   life too wherever and whenever I can apply it because it had always given me a   head start advantage over my competitors in this ever - changing innovative   market .     The more you begin to use a diagram while you talk and create a visual image   for people of how you are thinking . Things like symbols for example . If you are   looking for logos and the way the companies are indulged in representing   them is like a brand .        > Insights and <NAME>   What I have learned from conducting this exercise is getting in habit of doing   visualization is actually a way of cultivating that side of our brain work . It ’s   really really important to be able to understand the way that you communicate   with people .      At last , what I want to conclude is when I started getting in the habit of   visualizing things , I quickly see that the rest of the room responds to me when   I get up and start drawing .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am a business development manager responsible for marketing and selling new technology from the   ASEAN country into my own country , <ADDRESS> . My assignment was to bring a banking packaged   solution , which has been proven successful operationally in <ADDRESS> , and sell it to the banks in   <ADDRESS> . The scope of the system was that it would streamline the banking operations from the front- end to the customer - bank - end , house the customer data in one system so that data analytics could be   performed , and customer agents could use this system to cross - sell further banking products . The scope   was to get several <ADDRESS> banks to consider replacing their existing in - house development systems for   this packaged solution . 

 Our initial assumption was that it was operating well in <ADDRESS> , and therefore , it should operate   equally well in <ADDRESS> . We assumed that the only solution challenge was the language . We invested in   the translation of the package from English to Thai . After the translation was completed , we assumed   that the product was ready to be showcased . During the solution presentation sessions , we invited the   product experts from <ADDRESS> to fly over to <ADDRESS> and showcase the product to several Thai banks .   During several sessions , the product experts would show each of the package features meticulously to   the clients , with additional assistance in language translation by a temporary translator . The result was   that the client did n’t understand the product in terms on the language translation and in terms of how   the features could improve their business operations . We had to go back to the drawing board to   understand why our product launch did not work . 

 Assumptions 

 We came back to the drawing board to question our assumption in the product success . Our   assumptions were that the Thai banks should readily adopt the <ADDRESS> banking model , which we   assumed to be more efficient . The second big assumption was that , if the product is sold well in one <ADDRESS>   country , it should sell well in another Asian country . Our third assumption was that language was the   only product adoption barrier . 

 <NAME> <NAME> and storytelling are keys to success 

 We came back to the drawing board and realized that we were not empathetic to the client ’s needs and   we did not understand their business . We also assumed that the clients would readily link the business   values to the IT functions . We did not give them a story or reason to want the product . We turned   around the situation by doing the following : 

 •   Hire a banking expert to share with us his current pains with systems in <ADDRESS> and key   processes . 

 •   Identified key banking processes that would solve key business issues . 

 •   Co - create with the banking expert on the customer journey of a banking user . 

 •   Create a story of the journey of the banking user on a power point and then showcase that on   the system . 

 •   Get the expert to work with the systems expert to showcase the system . 

 We practiced the system demo several times before going back to the client the next round . 

 Results and insights 

 The customer was delighted with our second shot of the system showcase . We explained the system in   the local language and relate it to their existing business practice . They were delighted at the outcome ,   telling us that they now understand how the system could improve their business . They have identified   areas for product improvement , and they have now become one od the customers to help us co - create   and further develop the products for the next version .

"Storytelling : An innovative initiative to stop child 

 marriage 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Storytelling is a great tool to motivate people to bring change in them . Storytelling is a   process where the speaker knitted the story with actor and actress with strong but   compelling message and the audience find themselves inside the story . I choose to use this   tool to motivate people because I found it most convenient for me . Due to my   administrative authority I have to speak , communicate and meet with all kinds of people of   the society and they usually prefer to listen my speech . So this is a great opportunity for me   to tell stories to my audience and the service seekers . 

 Child marriage is a big problem in my country . According to UNICEF report , “ the State of   the World ’s Children , 2009 ” , 64 % of girls married before age 18 . Along with Child Marriage   Act , 1929 , the minimum age for marriage is 18 years for female and child marriage is   punishable by law . Though we have legal instrument , the rate of child marriage is very high   in rural area for many reasons . As I am serving as an administrative officer having   executive magistracy authority , I have to stop and sentence punishment for arranging child   marriage . But these are extreme measures I have to take when the illegal marriage is   occurring neglecting our request .   So I planned to make awareness through motivating the   parents to prevent child marriage . In rural area , parents believe that their female child   should be married at early age for many reasons- social tradition ( due to misleading   religious and social belief ) , dowry ( higher the age higher dowry practiced mostly in the   Hindu community ) , poverty , insecurity , not interested to invest after girl for education etc .   Due to my work responsibility I have the opportunity to visit schools and attend their   ‘ guardian assembly ’ especially the ‘ mother assembly ’ which occurs once in every month . I   selected to tell them a story taken from my colleague ’s personal life and motivate them   through the story . I found it interesting when I used to tell the story to school girls and   their parents , they appreciate the story very much and dream to become like my colleague . 

 Application 

 First , let me share the story with you . My colleague who is a female officer in civil service   told me the story which is taken from her childhood . When she was 16 years of age , her   father set her marriage with a magistrate who was also serving in civil service . But her   mother was not agreed with the decision and she denied and protested . She played a strong   role to protect her daughter from child marriage because she knew the hazards which will   occur after the marriage . She explained her family members about the physical and mental   shocks which will happen to the bride . She made promise to everyone that one day her 

 daughter would became magistrate by her own and she would provide every necessary   measure about her education . Due to her strong protest , my colleague ’s father compelled to   change his decision and provided all support for education . Now my colleague is a civil   servant as well as a magistrate and interestingly her husband is also a magistrate . Both of   her parents now feel proud that their decision was so right that now they get two   magistrates at same time in their family . 

 When I used to tell the story to students and their parents , I also try to make them   understand what might happen if child marriage occurred to a girl and how they can make   assets by educating her instead of marrying her at early age . I also share other stories from   my experiences from the girls whose marriages were stopped by me and later they are   doing well in their studies . In one assembly I took one such girl and her parents with me   and represent her in front of audience to share her experience and success . The feedbacks I   get from them are so inspiring- one day after my storytelling one father stood up and he   promised that he would support his daughters and nieces to make them educated so they   can walk raising their heads high . 

 Insight 

 The insights I got from the events that , people in rural or urban know about illegality of   child marriage , but when they get a good bridegroom ( in their definition ) the family   members force the girl to sit for the marriage without thinking far . They believe , girls have   to be married one day so why not now when you get the best bridegroom . And in some   community the parents believe rather to invest after education they will provide dowry   with that money . Mostly , uneducated and poverty driven parents are prone to get their   girls in early marriage . They do n’t try to understand the potential which yet to flourish   inside the girls . They do n’t foresee the possibilities among them . The storytelling tool   actually incite the hopes among the parents and they start to believe that their girls will   one day raise their heads high and not only them but also the society will feel proud for   them .   After listening the stories the audiences are sharing the stories to others in tea stall   or in house female gathering . So the stories are moving from ear to ear and make them   thinking about their girls ’ future . This tool can make them dreaming and the girls can build   their confidence to protect themselves from child marriage . 

 Approach 

 I have shared my views and experiences with my senior authorities and abled to convince   them to apply this approach to replicate in their jurisdiction . I plan to expand the   storytelling tool involving the girls whose marriages were stopped by administration or   local elites . These girls ’ stories will inspire other girls and parents . The girls can form   committee involving local representatives , elites and others who can take immediate steps 

 to stop child marriage and aware the vulnerable and prone families . Storytelling is a   powerful tool through which we can take innovative motivation initiative to change our   society .

"Challenge   I am leading a product development team of a company specialising in building IT systems   for government entities . The acquisition of consumer data is fundamental to the system , in   order to build downstream application to support business functions of our customers .   Although the data is acquired through third party providers , using agreed methods , one of   our key customers has highlighted a concern about the poor quality of the data received   from the third parties and lack of systems tools to efficiently identify third parties which are   not complying with the data requirements .      Following an initial engagement with the customer to understand   their problems , we have   done some brainstorming internally to build a prototype for a data quality tool to assist   customers with identification of compliance issues and subsequent engagement with third   parties to address those issues in an efficient manner . The challenge is to build a solution   which is fit for purpose and can be deployed quickly for customer feedback . The portfolio   team has agreed to fund a 3 - month project with the relevant resources . Our sales team will   help us to organise testing of the first prototype with a key customer organisation . The sales   team will also help to us to demonstrate prototype to two other customers to build a   product roadmap for other customers .     Selection     We have decided to use the learning launch tool . This will help us build an effective tool that   our customer can use to monitor any data quality compliance issues . We have done some   initial definition of the problem with a customer and worked with our own subject matter   experts to come up with a prototype . The selection of the learning launch tool will help us   to quickly get feedback from wider customer stakeholders and run hands - on experiments   with the customers to test or revisit our assumptions we have made and to refine the   prototype in iterations .     Application   As part of our first launch , we focused on demonstrating a web browser based user data   quality prototype that provides user dashboards to highlight any errors found within the   consumer data or incomplete data received through 3rd party providers . The dashboard also   provides a set of preconfigured views for users to get insight about the type of issues found   and enables them to drill into the actual data if required . The customer users had an   opportunity to navigate through the prototype interface and provided their feedback about   the features . This was enormous insight for us to know that the users found the interface   very intuitive to use with no user training and they could see the value the data quality tool   brings to help them with the compliance process . As the key assumptions have been tested   to be true , we had a go ahead to move to   the next iteration of the learning launch . As an   output of the first launch , we prioritised features for the next iteration based on the value   they bring to the users .      The second launch was to introduce a notification service into the prototype to send   automatic email alerts to the 3rd party providers for any errors found in the data without 

 requiring a user to initiate an action . Moreover , we built a few additional views to meet user   needs . This learning launch tools helped us to confirm a new product concept with an active   customer to ensure it fulfils their needs without having to wait for the full product to be   ready before the customer can see it . The learning launch proved to be a powerful tool to   align our product development with market needs and making sure an interest from the   customer users .      After securing a commitment from the customer to buy this new data quality tool , we were   able to demonstrate the prototype to two other customers to get their buy - in , which   provided a strong boost for the go - to - market plan based on robust commercial model .      Insight   We applied the learning launch to design and test our products . Through customer   engagement and learning through customer feedback , we were able to build a product to   meet customer needs . It felt reassuring to test our ideas and assumptions with the   customer . It is through this process we were able to get some insight about some other   features users would like to see in the overall system which will be really useful for the   future growth of our relationship with the customer . As part of the project closure exercise ,   we documented some lessons learnt through this session which will be useful for future   application of the learning launch tool .      Personally speaking , I have learnt a new way to approach problem solving   and be open to   apply a growth mindset to come up with a solution for a problem .      Approach   The learning launch is the right tool for our business as it offers both flexibility and agility to   test new concepts with our customers before they are turned into   commercial offerings .   We are going to review the lessons learnt from two launches , in order to make sure any   future launches benefit from this experience . Broadly speaking , this insight will also improve   how other design thinking tools can be combined with the learning launch tool to build a   right - sized framework for solving business problems .

"From mind mapping I understood that it can be used to explain things in a simple way and see if I am   on track . Not everyone can do this . But I always enjoyed doing my work in mind mapping way . 

 I have applied this tool to my challenge by making a flow chart or mind map as it helps me to do   things and keep track of them . 

 Next time I might apply different tool to see how it works .

"Design Thinking Reflection – Learning Launch Tool 

 Challenge     I am a manager responsible for the program and project management practice at a   consulting company that sells professional services around the globe .     In the last few months , I have been facing a challenge to improve and reshape our current   offerings in order to increase business sales and to create a distinctive position in the   global consulting marketplace . The scope of these offerings includes mainly business   transformational programs through tech - solutions . For example , the end - to - end enterprise   software implementation .     Our team of expert tech - consultants are focus on test new ideas to confirm the key   assumptions that our consulting leaders previously recommended to our line - of - service .     Selection     In order to attend completely our challenge and to become more agile , we are ready to   use the learning launch tool of design thinking framework . In general , the learning launch   tool is a kind of experiment that tests new ideas in real business environments . The main   purpose is to get the truth to confirm or dis - confirm our key business assumptions .     Application     At the beginning , we focused on the organization of our new ideas . The consultants did a   small benchmarking to meet the solutions already offered in the market and to check the   fit - level of innovation from each ones . This tested our assumption that our competitors   are offering similar services to cover the program and project management demands .     Then , we went through workshop sessions with consultants from other areas to get new   thoughts about our traditional offerings and to understand the lessons that our   organization learned on the previous assignments . This tested our assumption that other   consulting practices at the same organization also want to continuous improve their way   to provide professional services .      Finally , we focused on the execution of different tests in some on - going programs and   projects . In this case , we encouraged the team to work in an agile management approach   to measure the impact on the performance of their routine activities . This tested our   assumption that its possible improve our work with small changes of the team ’s mind - set .     Insight     By applying the learning launch tool , we confirmed some key assumptions and dis- confirmed other ones . For us this new experiment was very rich in several aspects . 

 Normally in this type of challenge , we need to create a business plan to set the   assumptions and to define the return of investments . The possibility to discuss many   hypothesis going through the unknown breaks down some business paradigms , resulting   in a new path to test the business ideas effectively .     Until this moment , the results exceeds our initial expectations . On the other hand , we   need to know that the design - thinking framework is much more than a learning launch   application , actually is a wide universe of concepts and tools to explore and get   agreement .     Approach     I believe there are excellent tools in the design thinking that should improve and help   even more the solution of our business challenges .    One example might be a mind mapping to help an organization to looking for patterns   during a data collect and analytics .     However , for that challenge we worked on , the learning launch tool seems to be the   appropriate tool to address our goals .

"Challenge and selection 

 Throughout my life as a student I have used tools such as mind mapping , QFD , and the CANVAS   method . At this stage of my career as a specialty mechanical designer , I will carry out a project   that must first be designed through ideas , several sketches , design proposals from several   colleagues taking all this to make a sketch of the prototype ( Go Kart ) in a design software and in   the end have the physical prototype in real life . He used the tool to launch a project that will be   carried out with a proposal of 4 members of a team , based on some questions , key elements ,   ideas and hypotheses and relationships between elements to consider for the client in this case   our Professor approve our project , you like our final project . 

 Application . 

 I begin the process by creating a graph of QFD , a quality management method , based on   transforming user demands ( teacher ) into design quality . To perform the QFD I will use a list of   questions , a survey and look for confirmation data , as existing material I can use existing go kart   sketch , 3d suspension modeling , address and the type of material that will be used , the CANVAS   method . All this to see if it is worth continuing with the proposed idea . 

 In this situation the CANVAS method occupies this method helps to reinforce the learning launch .   This model is a set of rectangles . The middle part has the value proposition together with   <NAME> <NAME> , a box on the left to identify key resources and key activities . 

 With the information obtained , the sketch will be done in a design software , in this case I will use   CATIA V5 . 

 For the activity , each team member will make a freehand drawing of the design of a Go Kart   already finished , with chassis , suspension , steering , braking , tires . 

 I give you several questions to answer or think about , such as : 

 What must be true for your idea to be good ? 

 How do you look for these confirmatory facts ? 

 Why the idea ? 

 Under what circumstances will it be a bad idea ? 

 Under what circumstances will the idea not be appropriate by the teacher ? 

 We have approximately 30 min . To discuss the questions to mark or write the error in the   freehand drawing , and then we mark additional ideas that come from the discussion . 

 Now another thing that is key is that we are all partial , we all see different things , therefore , we   have to share and collaborate . At the end the drawing is made in the CATIA V5 program and with   the final design of our Go Kart . 

 Insight and approach 

 What I learned when doing this exercise with 4 partners is that if in the end our project does not   work it should not harm my career , at the end of the account all the ideas are not good , a learning   launch is not a failure as long as you learn something , ideas are abundant , do not stay with an   idea , there will always be more ideas . 

 It is important to solve your assumptions , your hypothesis , your idea , product or service . Since a   learning launch is a search for the truth as well as a measure that advances life in general , the   measure that one can always do and the most important is WHAT IS NOT ? Because with this   question we can discover what we need to learn to achieve our goal .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge       My name is <NAME> <NAME> . I am ICT Director of a school in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . Some fifteen years ago I co- wrote some software to manage the internal venue bookings at our school . Being a software   developer was and is still not part of my role at the school , but integrating technology into the   curriculum and empowering staff and children to become responsible and capable adults in a   technology rich world , certainly is . We developed the software because there was nothing   commercially available at that stage that suited our needs and pocket . Another reason was that , in   those early years , when we were trying to get staff to use technology to improve the learning and   teaching experience , we reasoned that giving teachers ( and administrators ) tools to do their daily jobs   would improve literacy and have positive educational spin offs . The software has lived on and is used   extensively by an increasing number of people and for more than the original , quite simplistic ,   purpose . The software in function and form is very much end of life but the tool(s ) is so interwoven in   the fabric of how we manage events , sports practices , and classroom activities that we simply ca n’t   manage without it for any time at all . The software is buggy and is written in a language that is no   longer supported . Our challenge is to seamlessly replace the software with something that will meet   the new needs of the school , without disrupting daily activities , on a very tight budget and at the   same time win the buy in of the various managers who will very likely need to change their process .     The project scope includes the marketing departments and admin , grounds and teaching staff across   our three campuses , each of whom are responsible for different and varying components within the   current booking system model ; it particularly includes the academic staff who quickly and easily want   to book venues ( including equipment and resources ) for sport and teaching , with minimal fuss and   effort .      The project is limited to internal resources ( i.e. budget and employee time ) and there is no official   development team available . There is some in - house expertise with database and HTML knowledge   but the constraints of time and the competing needs of other educational demands is a challenge .      All systems in the school synchronise with active directory ( which means resources , venues and   groups of people are seamlessly available for selection / contact ) and a challenge is to offer a similar   feature in a replacement system . Not doing so would present overhead issues in terms of   management .      The IT team consists of the ICT Director , an ICT integrator , an ICT admin support person and the   Computer Studies teacher . The IT team is tasked with rolling out a replacement solution virtually   immediately as the current solution is causing frustrations . The school prioritises budget for   educational endeavours and simply does n’t have budget to spend on an expensive commercial   solution . The budget is very much capped ( non profit school )   and creativity is needed to deploy the   most effective tools within the proportional amount available for software .     Because of the urgency there is pressure to simply replace the current solution without a full   investigation into what is actually needed and why . 

 Selection     We decided to use the learning launch tool to deliver NOT a final product but a solution in the   making .     The design thinking process helped us understand expectations and needs . We chatted to staff and   students and used forms to gain further insights . We observed how staff were using the current   system and tried to journey map a wide variety of situations . We agreed as a team to put aside   discussions about solutions in the early stages and simply gathered as much information as we could .      What followed thereafter were some brainstorming sessions . The team invited a diverse range of   staff to join in and dream about what would be ideal in terms of managing bookings and the   brainstorming included , not only the booking itself but the event and after event activities too . We   sorted and organized our findings and from that came up with some design criteria , basic   functionality without which the staff would not be able to function . We also came up with a variety of   other needs / wants / wow factors that our staff had not really spoken of but that we surmised were   causing problems or frustrations or would perhaps add value . For example , when booking during an   exam time , the squash courts should only be available after teaching hours from a noise perspective ;   another insight was that the teaching day does n’t necessarily operate in typical calendar type time   slots and staff may want a view of their timetable when trying to book a teaching venue , which they   would think of for example as period 3 , rather 10.05 am .      Another insight / assumption that emerged was that the different types of bookings could be   differentiated . The ‘ booking type ’ was identified as one of a possible three types 

 1 . Teaching venue   2 . Sporting venue   3 . Pavilion , hall , theatre , chapel 

 The team then looked at free / inexpensive technology tools or solutions that could be adapted in   creative ways to meet the criteria and decided to prototype solutions for each of the three types .   We had closely observed the students and staff to uncover their unmet needs and used the   learning launch tool to work as a team through iterative cycles of live experimentation ;   prototyping to test our assumptions , discovering and learning from feedback , refining and   relaunching the new prototype .      We began experimenting with existing software – Wordpress ; Office 365 Cloud calendars and   HTML as well as free web software ( and some paid demo software ) . We launched a number of   different prototypes to quickly test whether what we thought the staff wanted would make a   positive difference to how they worked .      Application       Our staff had a specific need ; they wanted to be able to book venues . Several design ideas met that   need better than the current alternative because the process involved in booking one sort of venue   was very different from the process involved in booking another sort . All sorts of ‘ Cloud ’ features   offering anytime , anywhere access were also possible . Furthermore , existing controls were frustrating 

 for the staff and students ; lack of control in management for more ‘ public ’ venues was also an issue .     Initially we focused on frustrations around booking the group venues in our resource centre . Students   traditionally made the bookings via their teacher but had no way of seeing which rooms were   available via the resource centre website , a place they would regularly visit to find research and other   material . We wanted to test our assumption ( quickly and cheaply ) that students wanted to be able to   book directly , in their current work space and that they would respect each others ’ access to a venue   and not pre - book all venues in a way that excluded others from having a fair chance . Our resource   director who was frustrated by the current system agreed to give this a ‘ go ’ .      We committed as a team to six things 

 1 . Roll out a prototype within one week    2 . Choose a particularly difficult student year group as they would push the boundaries and be 

 hard task masters 

 3 . Focus on the assumptions of needs / wants    4 . Question our own bias   5 . Listen to feedback   6 . Adapt , refine and redeploy as we worked 

 We met every day as a team for an hour to share our progress and review where we were at . We built   a web interface that made use of existing Office 365 calendars that we could overlay with the school   timetable and other features . There were buttons on the page that did n’t yet do what was ultimately   intended but gave the students and staff sufficient feedback . Feedback was immediate ( a comment   button on the page ) , coupled with lots of interaction with the students and staff . Our first few   iterations of the prototype were very much work in progress but felt real .     Then team observed how the staff and students engaged with the software and were easily and   quickly able to test the assumptions about where responsibility could lie , where to host the solution   and how the features and screen should be arranged to best accommodate the requirements . The   team also spoke to boys and staff to find out if 

 1 . Their needs had been met   2 . They were ‘ wowed ’   3 . What problems they could anticipate i.e. what could the pitfalls be ( and boy did the students 

 come up with some curved balls ! ) 

 In this way , the team were able to quickly and iteratively roll out and test alternative suggestions /   improvements and adapt the solution on the fly . The outcome has exceeded expectations and work   will follow on tackling the other booking types in a similar way .     Insights     Involving the staff and students in the design of a new system had three positive spin offs .   Staff and students 

 1 . were accommodating of mistakes and less frustrated with the current booking issues    2 . made good ( and bad ) suggestions and those not accommodated are recorded for future 

 releases 

 3 . have taken ownership of the process and collaborate to make it work 

 The IT team had felt responsible for the existing software issues but had been powerless to resolve   them . Through the design process they better understood the staff and students ’ needs and were   more patient with human errors in the existing system , which will continues to operate in parallel   until all the features have been met in the new solution .      The team used data from feedback to resolve conflicts and get buy in a democratic way . There   certainly were challenges and frustrations . Real effort needed to go in to make sure that people felt   that they had been heard .     The speed of deployment was positive . Immediate feedback was hugely rewarding and in a ‘ live ’ test   even criticism felt constructive and was well received . The team were unanimous in preferring to   know virtually immediately whether they were going down the right road in terms of meeting needs .     The diversity of the group , who do n’t normally collaborate in this sort of way , added huge value . The   management overhead on staff was reduced and the students were given a new responsibility within   a safe space .      Approach     Having identified our assumptions the iterative learning launch cycle tested these assumptions in a far   more satisfactory way than the traditional approach of delivering a solution that may / may not meet   expectations .   The below illustration attempts to describe the somewhat linear and limited approach   to a problem versus the more chaotic but yet more effective design thinking approach . We are   presently modelling design thinking principles in our planning for other component to resource   management and other projects .         An illustration of old approach       vs     New Approach 

 We intend to do formal training with our staff and with our students . It is so important that the   students we teach are not afraid to fail and that we create a space where failure is not seen negatively   but as a chance to learn and grow .

"Reﬂection on Visualization Tool 

 By <NAME> <NAME> . 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In this globally connected space of creative practitioners and design students , while working on a   large team with varied mindset , it becomes important to bring everybody onboard with the broad   goal that needs to be achieved . In one of my recent projects , I got the opportunity to work with a   global team of designers . We were a team including students from <ADDRESS> , US and <ADDRESS> .    While our common interest for accessible product design helped us to agree collectively on some   baseline outcomes that we had to achieve , but it was also important for us to know each other   and have clarity about everyone ’s hopes , expectations , positionality , skills etc . Although I think of   myself as a good team person who has several experience working on a group projects , working   with a global team had never happened to me . I wanted to be mindful of how to approach the   conversation starter , get acquainted with each other and build a positive team spirit . 

 Visualisation tool is one of the most dynamic tool that allows different voices to be heard in   various forms like sketching , making connections through lines and graph , mapping thoughts ,   imaging etc . Through the course I also learnt how visualisation tool can also be applied at   different stages of the project depending on time and requirement . Since it is simple and easy to   use , we collectively found some of visualisation tools that I wanted us to try out to see how it   could help in a global and inter - cultural team throughout the project . 

 Application 

 Since we were bunch of people from different countries , it was important for us to know the   positionality , interests and cultural background of each other . We started with some activities like   sketching idea of team - work , sketching idea of success , mapping positionality ,   sharing picture of   their workspace . This acted as ice - breaker activities to initiate conversations to know about each   other and come closer in terms of a team . We also ideated individual avatar that was a fun and   engaging activity to do . Only in the few hours , we learnt quite a few interesting aspects of each   other 's lives and culture . I felt that during the pandemic , such activities helped us empathise with   circumstances of one another before we delved into the formal project . 

 Our team was working on finding new user - centric and inclusive products for kitchen . In the   following steps of research , we used visualisation tool to find hidden pattern , generate qualitative   and quantitative data insights . During our online interview with the sample user set , we   extensively used photograph and video method for journalling ‘ day in a life ’ . We also shared single   page toolkit to thoroughly add their regular routine .   Using this visualisation tool helped us   understand closely about the lives of the user because it was more convenient for the users to    photographs of thing things interact with rather than trying to recall everything and narrate it to us   on call .   It basically made the activity more humanistic , engaging while also helping us understand   the nuance challenges they faced everyday . It was also convenient for the design team to ask   questions regarding certain artefacts that were shared in the pictures . We also used visual   thinking tools like Empathy mapping ,   sticky notes tools to make connections during the research   phase and create visual mood - board the product ideas the team wanted to work on . 

 In the crucial stage of product ideation and user feedback , visual tools came in really handy .    Taking the innovative mindset approach for the ideation phase , we engaged in rigorous and   intense product ideation that aimed at generating as many of ideas without any judgement . The   product ideation included many aspects like form , usability , ergonomics etc . I have to admit that   the inter - cultural and inter - disciplinary approach turned out to be   beneficial for us as it helped in   bringing thoughts from our own experiences and personal interactions with people with disability   as well . After the ideation , we took those designs to user to take inputs . Everything was in online   mode , so we either presented the ideas to the users or sent them images through main . They   could either print it and scribble on it , or write their comments and thoughts separately and share   with us . The ideation and finalising the design was the most engaging and critical aspect of the   project that went pretty well . 

 Insight and Approach 

 Working online with remote users and team is challenging . While it could create gaps in how each   one of us understood the information , visualization tools like images , videos . Empathy mapping   made sure that the data we gathered through research and user interview was available to us in   different forms that we could refer back to at any stage of the process . These tools also made it   easier for the user to participate in the interview better without seeming disconnect due to the   designs . We were able to share the designs with them over email , which they could either print   and scribble at or edit it online with some assistance , or share their viewpoints with us online on   video .   We put everything up on Miro to extend our discussion in the group . I learnt and realised   how these tools bring out nuance aspects during the whole project , from framing questions t to   mapping user journey to ideating prototypes . They help communicate in non - verbal mode with   more clarity that everybody could see and interact with . It helped me understand how in an   innovation led design process , visual tools can enrich the information and help understand the   context better . 

 Overall , I feel although I was already acquainted with some visual thinking tools , I realised their   significance more after applying them consciously in the project . Visualisation tool is a very useful   method of ethnographic research and ideation . It is certainly a very inclusive tool that values   different multimedia into the each stage of design process . 

 The project went pretty well . But I think it took us time to plan the use of different tools effectively .   Although we coped well during our online work , next time I would like to try them out during in- person project research and ideation . I am pretty sure it would be more engaging and useful that   way . During out last project , we used the template that we gathered from the internet . For my next   project , I am thinking to customise the information before sending out the toolkit to users so that   that our intention is explained well , and the toolkit does better hand - holding in the process .   I am   Also going to   find other kinds of visual thinking tools that either exist or have been generated by   people itself .

"Overcoming Barriers - The Story of the Movie at a Fuel Distribution Plant 

 Challenge 

 The certification program for fuel distribution plant management systems owned by oil company was in   process . I was responsible for coordinating the project . The certifications were conducted by an   international auditing company and were intended to meet requirements defined by the oil company 's   industrial customers . Until that moment , a large number of fuel distribution plants had been achieving   certificates of compliance . However , there was a particular plant where management system   implementation process was not reaching the target . The deployment process had been tried more than   twice unsuccessful . Plant employees were demonstrating resistance to the implementation of the   management system . In order to get the process done , the plant manager had made some decisions   that confronted the employees , which made the situation worse . Given this fact , it was necessary to   understand the reasons for the failure of the attempts and to implement the management system in an   innovative manner , in order to meet the goal set by the direction of the oil company . 

 Selection 

 The situation required careful exploratory action on what was happening at the plant . It was more than   obvious that measures of force , objectionable , would not solve the problem , especially since the   organizational ambience had been tried and made worse . Thus , as coordinator of the Oil Company   program , I chose to personally conduct research on the source of the problem and to conduct   innovative actions to achieve the certification goal . In this way , I chose to use the <NAME> tool to   establish an empathetic relationship with the plant 's staff , so that they could expose their dissatisfaction   in stories , define the problem most perceived by people , contextualize the problem and act ,   transforming the dissatisfaction of the team in satisfaction with the achievement of the results . The   choice of the tool was due to a past experience of using the same tool , when I also had to deal with   behavioral problems of a group of engineering sector employees of the same company , whose project   and project implementation sectors were constantly diverging , causing significant delays in the delivery   of the works . At that time , I used the concepts of the books by <NAME> <NAME> ( “ The Design of Everyday   Things ” ) and <NAME> <NAME> ( “ Change by Design ” ) to turn pain points into delights , abandon the status quo   of processes and practices conducted in the engineering department and lead teams towards the future   scenario . The <NAME> proved quite effective to create an open and continuous narrative that   involved people and encouraged them to proceed in solving the main problem originated prejudice   among sectors and lack of mutual trust between people . Also in the activity to be narrated , the same   authors and books served as a bibliographic reference . 

 Application 

 Work began with the distribution plant team carefully . I did not address failure in attempts to deploy   the management system . Initially , I used some edited films to break the ice , addressing issues such as   perseverance to overcome barriers ( "" The Pursuit of Happyness "" , with <NAME> <NAME> ) ; confronting prejudice   and the struggle for the ideal ( “ <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ” , with <NAME> <NAME> ” ) ; inspiration when in times of   hopelessness and crisis ( "" Walt Before Mickey "" , with <NAME> <NAME> ) and breach of trust between leader   and followers , which is overcome by team maturity ( "" Inception "" , with <NAME> <NAME> ) . After   watching each movie , I distributed people to groups for discussion and presentation of the central ideas   of the films presented . For the last film , in addition to the groups , I requested a solo presentation from   the plant manager , who addressed the issues of the film and paralleled his performance in front of the   team , making it clear that he had made recent mistakes in project execution decisions , and asking for a   vote of confidence to improve their performance . Throughout this first phase , based on <NAME> and   <NAME> , I sought to empathize with the team members as well as between them and me . Rapport   techniques were also used to assist in this process . 

 The next step was to invite the team to star in their own movie . I used <NAME> to build the story   from a group challenge in line with <NAME> . The director of the film would be me and the plant manager   would be the “ stagehand ” . I set the storyline of the film , which would tell the story of the plant team   and their efforts to achieve management system certification ( the story from a challenge ) . We would   not define the title yet . The tentative name would be "" Our Movie . "" I informed that the script of the film   would be presented in a storyboard with 6 frames ( the clusters or groups of information , according to   <NAME> ) , transcribed in sheets of flip chart . 

 I started the preparatory activities for the film , addressing about the moment of the plant that the film   would be shown , that is , the description of the status quo , according to <NAME> . In what situation were   the actors in the film before the certification journey , their doubts , questions and opinions about the   goal ? I led as a director of the film a divergent discussion ( <NAME> ) . Organizational , functional and labor   issues could be presented and discussed one by one . At this stage , besides myself , I worked so that all   members of the group paid close attention to each other and each one could speak , inhibiting   monopolization by one person ( <NAME> ) . Through my encouragement , using the “ 5 Why s Methodology ”   technique to identify the root cause of the problem , and continuing to use Rapport techniques to build   the empathy map , everyone was able to talk about their activities . What they thought about the plot of   the film , its perceptions and inferences ( <NAME> ) in relation to the moment . Thus , it was possible that ,   naturally , everyone shared the particular and collective frustrations ( <NAME> ) . Still , there were   questions and confusion from the group about exactly what a management system certification process   was . I recorded at powerpoint all aspects of the group 's statements simultaneously . Doubts were   elucidated , I led questions and answers elaborated by the group members themselves , until a problem   most strongly perceived by the group ( pain point , according to <NAME> ) was highlighted by all and   elected as the starting point of the film . The behavioral resistance of the group in relation to the   implementation of the certification system was identified , based on wrong information provided by the   region 's workers ' union ( source of unemployment ) and mistaken inferences propagated by influencers   in the group ( increase in workload , without increase salary ) . 

 Having reached this stage , I designed films that presented , from the implementation process to   obtaining the management system certificate , the experience of two of the company 's fuel distribution   plants . The films featured employee testimonials , scenes of work done , everyone 's reaction to the   announcement of the success of international certification , and , finally , what the routine of the plant   was like after certification . I then separated the team into four groups , asking them to produce six   paintings ( <NAME> ) that told the story , in this case the film , of that plant 's management system   certification , considering : 

    1st table : description of the current situation in the plant ( status quo ) ; 

    2nd table : presentation of the finding that would break with the status quo ; 

    3rd chart : description of the emotional reaction of the group with the finding ; 

    4th table : presentation of innovative ideas for conducting the plant certification process ; 

    5th table : presentation of how the group would act during the implementation of innovative ideas ,   conducting the plant certification process ; 

    6th table : description of the new situation of the group after the international certificate was won . 

 During the framing of the films by the groups , I stayed close and interacting with everyone ,   strengthening the empathy framework and urging everyone to abandon the status quo and dare to   generate ideas for conducting the certification process . At the end of time for the work , all groups had   produced his films , exposed in the storyboard of six frames . Each group posted their pictures on each   wall of the room where the work was conducted . From there , I started the "" direction "" of all four films   produced . I requested that each group member chooses a character to play , from a relationship that I   presented , consisting of one management systems consultant , two employees , one supervisor and one   manager . I rehearsed with each group what their “ acting ” would be like when presenting their films . For 

 each group , the “ stagehand ” , that is , the plant manager , would act helping the continuity in the   performances , so that the film did not suffer “ continuity problems ” . Thus , after all the rehearsals and   corrections , the groups were able to “ stage ” their films . While a movie was being screened by a group ,   the others watched as they ate popcorn brought in by the plant 's service assistant . 

 After the presentations of all the films were completed , I began discussions to evaluate each of the six   frames presented in the films , with the purpose of consensing the frames and producing a single movie   that told the story of the plant . Regarding Chart 1 , there was unanimity in the presentation of the   groups , which showed that the team was fully aware of their situation and their current behavioral   posture . The same happened with Table 2 . In Chart 3 , different situations arose . For some groups , there   was no surprise that it would break with the status quo . For others , surprise set the tone . Regarding   Table 4 , all groups presented different ideas . I related all the ideas and led the divergent discussion   ( <NAME> ) about them , so that they all deviated from the points presented and evaluated the ideas   without prejudice and without disagreement . So , I led the team with all the emulation of the journey for   each presented idea , so that all live the problem , simulate how ideas would be applied to visualize the   effects of the application of the ideas and expectations generated ( <NAME> ) . This reduced the initial list   of ideas . I conducted the exercise of evaluating the perception of value that each idea would add   ( <NAME> ) in the process of implementing the management system , both to achieve the goal , but mainly   to the people of the plant . Which ideas would act in the binomial person x problem solving , turning pain   points into delights ( <NAME> ) and changing the status quo to a desired future scenario . Once again , the   list of ideas has been reduced to about four or five ideas . The next step was to evaluate the viability of   ideas ( Norman and Brown ) . What could be done ? What would be technically possible ? Everything that   could be implemented in the short term and also met the corporate requirements of the oil company .   The result was the consensus of the length of two ideas , which were adjusted to each other , so they   were bound together in only one single idea . After this work , it was very interesting to realize the “ Wow   Effect ! ” ( Norman and Brown ) in the participants , who noted how the consensus solution added value to   the process of deploying the management system at the plant . Regarding Table 5 , groups presented   similar action plans and schedules , which were consolidated into a single action plan , with phases that   added or merged into a larger one . In Chart 6 , the groups presented their respective photos or   presented reports of how they understood that their activities and tasks would be transformed , with   changes in routines , but without generating extra workload . The group decided to use the two   approaches in <ADDRESS> 6 final , inserting a summary report , along with a photo of the entire plant team ,   making positive gestures and satisfaction with the achievement of international certification , which they   unanimously gleaned from that moment . The consensus team named the film "" Overcoming Barriers . "" 

 Insight 

 The use of <NAME> in the case presented allowed me some conclusions . When I started working with   the team , I used some films with core ideas , such as perseverance and trusting relationships . I noticed in   the team some nonverbal language typical of those who think they are manipulated , or simply unbelief .   On the other hand , I found that this reaction completely disappeared from the moment the work of   establishing empathy was carried out during the discussion of the reality of the plant and its problems . It   worked very well not to let the failures of previous attempts to obtain international certification be   mentioned . Thus , the word “ guilt ” did not appear at any time in the works , which made participants   more comfortable to interact and expose their opinions throughout the activity . Another point that   worked very well was awaiting the team reaches an established level of empathy for conduct the   activity and , only after , to present the films that teams from other plants recorded , showing their   experiences with the implementation of management systems . I noticed that this experience , in   addition to messing with people 's pride , ended up destroying prejudices that still exist in part of the   team . Finally , impress me enough to conclude that the design challenges are not only a great way to 

 benefit from the power of generating innovation , as well as create stories around an idea , turning   people from passive observers into participants involved , doing- become part of the story . 

 Approach 

 Some lessons learned were found in the application of <NAME> and motivate adjustments in the   application of this tool in future activities . The first is the importance of starting work by providing more   information on who suffers from the product or service ( <NAME> ) . In this case , I would use the   Visualization Tool of Design Thinking and present real stories written , post its or powerpoints , from the   industrial customers in the oil company on problems experienced in relation to the care of that   particular plant . Based on this information , I would work with the team to write in flipchart charts their   views on the issues raised . This has not been done and could in some ways have improved collective   awareness with the need for an innovative solution in implementing the management system . Other   improvement point refers to the absence of an individual time for each of the members could have their   insights and awakenings ( <NAME> ) . All activity was conducted in a group manner . I believe the possibility   to also gather perceptions of individuals , and not only small groups could confer higher quality and   depth in the generation of solutions . Finally , even though the activity has achieved the proposed   objective , some good innovative ideas have been abandoned , not for technical viability , but for   contradicting corporate positions . <NAME> <NAME> 's phrase that the best ideas die more often , because they   fail to navigate the dangerous waters of the organization in which they are born , is a reality rather than   market rejection .

"Challenge : 

 I am a consultant and was brought in by a client to improve their new product development testing   process . They had issues with three key areas in the development process . They had trouble forecasting   resources , tracking test samples and reporting test lab performance . Many departments were involved   in the testing process including design engineering , project management , information technology ( IT )   and test engineering . There were already established processes that were sub - optimized .   Most of the   processes were not documented and people could describe their role but not the entire process .   I had   one month to define the overall problem they were facing and gain cross - functional approval for   potential solutions . 

 Selection : 

 I selected the visualization tool to address this challenge because of the complexity . There were so many   steps to the process it was hard to follow verbally . Most of the users of the process did not understand   the complete scope . They knew the parts they were involved with but not the entire system . In the   visualization video from week 1 , <NAME> <NAME> suggested using this tool as non - verbal way show people   what you are thinking . Once people know what you are thinking , you are more likely to achieve a sense   of agreement .   Agreement is key to gaining approval for the potential solutions . 

 Application : 

 To create the visualizations , I needed to understand the new product development testing process   myself .   I met with key stakeholders and used MS <NAME> on a screen and started creating a process flow   diagram using their input . When the process went beyond the knowledge of the stakeholders , I   scheduled meetings with subject matter experts for those areas . Once the entire process was mapped , I   shared it and made updates accordingly . 

 Once the current state process was mapped , I used the process map visualization to identify issues .   I   numbered each step in the process . We then walked through each step and listed issues encountered to   get a complete picture of the problems . 

 Insights : 

 Mapping the process and sharing it with the team opened a lot of people ’s eyes on how big and complex   the process was .   It also made us realize there was more to the problem than fixing the initial issues   identified . It also got IT more involved in the problem - solving process since they were never involved   with testing new products . They supported the software but did not know how it was used and its   positive and negative impacts . Having a visual also created a common reference point and alignment   that allowed people to communicate more effectively .   Finally , it helped create a common purpose to   move forward with solutions . 

 Approach : 

 Next time I would use the same visualization tools because it did an excellent job gaining agreement on   how the process worked . To improve on this , I would get more people involved early in the mapping 

 process . I had to continually correct / refine the map every time someone was added to the team . If they   were involved at the onset , it would have taken fewer iterations and less time .

"REFLECTION - STORYTELLING 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 I am a Life Coach and certified in <ADDRESS> coaching . I started coaching since the days no one had a   clue about what <NAME> was , apart from the students ’ coaching classes for studies or sports . It used to   be very difficult to make people understand what it actually is . In order to make them not just know   what it is but also in some way what <NAME> could do to and for them , I started using <NAME> tool   of Design Thinking . 

 My target audience , in the initial day , were women who have been away from home for various reasons   and have their own challenges to work around . They were women who were no more sure of their   capabilities and were lacking confidence and self - esteem . In order to help them in any way , they had to   be ‘ opened up ’ and given assurance that this is a safe container and they can trust this process . 

 Fortunately I had my own story to share , to begin with , which was starting from B.Sc Maths to Masters   in Computer Science to now being a certified Life Coach . I had so much to share in terms of what I   became and how I transformed with every change in my life . 

 The women I was working with were skeptical to any change in their life , even if for their good . They had   not seen life in any other way than just the way how it was moving forward . 

 During my certification I had done some sessions as a part of the course and there I saw some amazing   results . Those stories were shared to make people know about coaching and also motivate them to see   it in a different light for them to take the 1st step towards their bright future . 

 When shared those stories , with full anonymity , one related to them and started sharing some bit of   theirs and also gained confidence in the process . 

 Application : 

 I was mostly inclined towards women during the start of my Coaching career as they were my reflection   too . I was coming out of my 5 years of sabbatical and exactly knew the fears I went through when I got   back . 

 I used my story and another very favourite transition story to tell people how one can explore their   fullest potential by just having some honest conversations with a coach . The Coach does not make you   change anything or does not tell you what to do but only helps you to introspect and get to know   yourself and needs better . 

 I shared my story from being in the peak of my Digitial Marketing career when I became a mom and how   I took a back seat to take care of my child and then did not loose hope to get back to work . I explored   my need better by going through a Coaching session and realized Coaching was my calling . I studied to   be more authentic in this field and got a certificate to carry my practice . It has been 4 years since I   changed my career and not one day I have regretted . Doing what I like doing has helped me improve the   quality of my family interactions and bond too . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 My story did comfort the women around that I am not only coaching them but I have also walked the   talk in my own life too . 

 With this I witnessed women opening to me easily and they had less apprehensions of being judged or   ending up wasting their time . 

 Some wanted to know more about my life and how I got the confidence at such an age to start from   scratch and also pursue it with passion as a career . I attracted women going through the same situation ;   taken sabbatical and want to do something more meaningful this time when they go back to work . 

 I had another brilliant story to share which was such an eye - opener for me too . 

 One Coachee had come to me for coaching because of a break - up . She was not in a good emotional   state . We had a few sessions where she expressed a lot and we moved from one goal to the other in the   process of Coaching for 6 months . 

 The transitions we went through from our 1st sessions to the end were just brilliant . 

 Break - up to wanting to do something else than the Content writer she was , to make - artist to hair - stylist   to free lancer fashion consultant to now a certified and successful Yoga instructor ! 

 This story had made a great impression on people , of how Coaching can be used to explore your highest   potential . 

 I realized that my story and this favourite one of mine has impacted a lot of coaches of mine in the right   way ; made them open up , have confidence in themselves and also strive to reach different heights . 

 This   tool surely is my favourite has it has helped me in educating people about Coaching in a more   authentic and trustful way . 

 I am so grateful to it and make a point to use this tool to touch people genuinely and deeply 

 -A Coach ’s attempt always !

"My Reflection – Design Thinking 

 Challenge : 

 I am currently serving as President of Alumni association of my alma mater , a leading Management   education institute in <ADDRESS> . It is a relatively young institute and has completed only a decade since   inception . I am a graduate from the 3rd batch .   Every year , we are joined by Young Professionals aspiring   to become future managers and leaders across our MBA and Executive MBA programs . Since last three   years , we have witnessed a decline in the emotional and cultural connect students have with the institute   during and after the course . Entrepreneurship and socially responsibility are key tenets of our culture   which was inculcated in pioneer batches . The shift was due to multiple factors ; we moved to new   permanent campus and lost the heritage of old one which was further augmented by sharp increase in   student enrolments . We , as alumni group was a little worried . We wanted to ensure that students imbibe   cultural heritage and struggles of the institute to the incoming students along with the force which binds   it together . 

 Selection & Application : 

 I brainstormed with my team and selected two good methods through which we can pass on right   message and also have student ’s attention for a longer duration . Due to pandemic , we could only interact   with the students virtually . One is through visualization , where we can show , pictures and videos of our   journey from Day-1 and tell upcoming students how we have evolved in last one decade . What we did   right and what we learnt so far and course corrected . The other method was storytelling which required   passing on the message through personal stories of time we have spent on campus and how it has helped   us do better in subsequent years so far .   We finally decided to use “ Story Telling ” and the biggest reason   was the fact that through stories we can tell students how those learning have benefited us .   This will also   ensure we do n’t bore students and leave them without any clear take away . 

 We decided to have two dedicated sessions for incoming students . I selected six high performing alumni   who are doing very well in their post MBA journey and are well - connected with the institute as well since   they graduated . Each alumnus was tasked to come prepared and focus on different aspects of our culture   and heritage We had multiple dry runs to iterate and refine our key story points . 

 Insights & Approach : 

 During both the sessions , alumni seal the deal . They presented the messages with their own student life   anecdotes and also covered how that helped . I started and presented my thoughts with below points 

    Build and nurture relationships – Be it personal or professions on both fronts , relationships   should be nurtured continuously and why we should n’t wait for a time to come to start thinking   about them . I told how our institute have very inclusive culture built on mutual respect 

    Work on at least one of your weakness in next 2 years – For me it was Written and Oral   communication in English . I am good orator since childhood but when it came to English as   medium of communication , I struggled . I told students what how our institute helped me 

    Learn to Prioritize and strengthen one of your existing strength – I told them how I nurtured my   leadership ’s skills by taking multiple positions of responsibilities along with becoming President   of Student council . I discussed what avenues available are and how it can be leveraged . I told   them funny stories and sleepless nights I have spent 

 After we completed both the sessions , we asked students for a detailed feedback . We found that   students loved the sessions and understood what as an institute we stand for and what we aspire to   become . After their first term was over , we asked <NAME> about it and to our surprise we were told   that students do quote learning from the Alumni sessions during class discussions and are more aligned   with our values and culture . 

 Approach - Due to pandemic , we did these two sessions virtually this year but after initial success , we   have decided that next year , we will ask alumni to come to campus in person and rather than a class   room session . Alumni will walk through the students to the campus down the memory lane with nuggets   of wisdom , they acquired .

"Challenge & Selection 

 The objective of the study is to analyze the variables that influence the development of   <ADDRESS> , highlighting the interrelationships that exist and noting aspects that are sometimes   not very intuitive . 

 I selected the <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> because I think it allows me to organize and associate   ideas and focus on the target . Likewise , I can graphically account the relationships   between them and how they influence each other . 

 Application 

 Then the list of variables identified by the team , the same as arise from brainstorming   and consultation with experts on the subject shown . 

    Lack of a State Policy 

    Deficient Tax Policy 

    State Corruption 

    Investment in Infrastructure and Research and Development 

    Technological development 

    Primary Economy Exporting 

    Wealth Distribution 

    Lack of structural reforms 

    Deficient Legal Structure 

    Poor Educational Level 

    Poor Access to the Health System 

    Lack of innovation 

    Values and National Identity 

 With the Mind Mapping Tool has managed to distinguish relationships between these   variables : 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned using this tool is that in the group there may be various   contributions that we probably would not have imagined from trying to do the work   alone . 

 The multidisciplinary work tries to discover the solution to the problem from different   angles and points of view . One can even visualize the relationships that exist between   these variables and as an influence on others .

"REFLECTION - STORYTELLING 

 CHALLENGE AND SELECTION : 

  Marketing the products which was produced by the famers is the major challenge to 

 them . 

  Transporting the product from the field to the market is another challenge faced by 

 them . 

 APPLICATION AND INSIGHTS : 

 Agriculture is the backbone of <ADDRESS> . Since my business deals with agriculture , our 

 basic concern here is the challenges faced by the farmers . The major challenge for agriculture 

 is that it is dependent of seasonal rains . And <ADDRESS> is a country that has been witnessing 

 drastic change in climate and seasonal rains in the recent past . 

 Since most of the crops are seasonal , the farmers do not have flow of income at all times of 

 the year . And even during the time of harvest he can not be sure about how much he can milk 

 from his yield . This unexpected situation creates a major problem to the farmers . Sometime 

 they ca n’t even meet the breakeven . 

 Farmers face transportation challenges on both ends of their business .   The one that we think 

 about the most is when it comes to shipping their crops / animals / milk .   Food , specifically raw 

 produce , is of perishable nature .   In fact , milk gets special treatment when it comes to how it 

 is shipped and also fluctuation of price in the market is another problem faced by them . Due 

 to this problem the farmers were unable to bear the transportation cost . Due to unfair price for 

 the products in the market they threw the vegetables on the road side . 

 APPROACH : 

 Few industries are supporting the farmers by proving money to grow the crops . For example : 

 <ADDRESS> . Industries make the farmers to do continuous production of crop which make profit on 

 both the ends . While considering to the wide range of products such as fruits and vegetables 

 the farmer facing there are many challenges such as marketing and the transportation . 

 In order to help generate a regular mode of income for the famers by solving the marketing 

 and transportation challenges . My idea is to start a brand for their product and the products 

 will sell to the food processing industries . So I am using the story telling tool to solve the 

 challenges faced by the farmers . The industries can procure their raw materials from the 

 farmers through the common label . This business model can solve the problem of farmers by 

 eliminating the many distributors and middlemen from the process .

"Reflection- Mind - Mapping 

 Challenge and selection 

 Mind mapping is a very innovative tool . As I teach students of engineering background , this tool   always helps me to motivate students to develop creative solution of any problem . The basic   challenge with the engineering students was the approach , they always think in a traditional   approach in which they are habitual to use their left side of the brain . For designing of any   engineering solution , usually , students were dependent on the past data/ past engineering   solutions/ literature that give them traditional thinking solutions . I use mind mapping techniques   frequently with the students and colleagues for research purposes . I have used sticky notes   technique with the students by giving them a problem and asked for identifying the pattern and   theme lying inside the diversified data . This technique is very helpful to communicate diversified   views on a particular problem by the individuals . 

 Application 

 I would like to share a mind - mapping technique used by the engineering students of our   university . I have given a problem “ how to make online education more interesting and   engaging ” to the students to develop creative solutions .   Students were divided into different   groups of five members each . Each student has given time ( 30 minutes ) to explore the   information or data from the partner / students of other groups ( survey ) or from the internet . Then ,   the students have to write their views on sticky notes and place them on the whiteboard . Every   student had written their views and placed them on the board . After the inspection by me , I told   to identify the pattern or theme from the various sticky notes and the theme/ pattern should be   written on the top as the title from other colored sticky notes and put all the relevant sticky notes   below that title so that we can identify the various patterns from the different views given by the   students . Students were very excited and we recorded the highest participation in the session due   to the adoption of a new methodology . Students were given different views from which the   pattern was identified to brainstorm . 

 Insight and approach 

 The learning I got from conducting this activity is that the students have ideas and creative minds   to develop any creative solution but we need to motivate them for a systematic approach to   develop creative solutions like mind mapping . As we have used sticky notes to share the various   maybe even wild views related to problems which given them some pattern to think for a   possible creative solution , this kind of mind mapping technique should be used to develop an out   of the box solutions . 

 Apart from sticky notes which I have used randomly , I came to know the different techniques of   mind mapping from this course , now I will be more confident to use the various mind mapping   techniques to communicate the views of individuals and make students use most of these   techniques .

"Challenge : 

 Many of my colleagues were disturbed by our organisation ’s new / unwritten value system . Many of   us were afraid of losing some values ( human - centred and emphatic , inclusive , engaging   workforce ) , which were deemed to be extremely important to many of us . 

 In order to work some of these elements , we decided to do a design thinking challenge on ‘ how   to make our organisation more inclusive for people with disabilities and limitations ? ’ . Why did we   select this challenge ? Well - we wanted to have a topic which is not only very much human- centric and engaging but also tackles with inclusion overall . We wanted to contribute to the social   conversation we were having openly   at that moment . And there we go - we had a great topic ! 

 Selection : 

 We have selected storytelling as a tool since we believe in the power of storytelling . We wanted to   put the human beings and their experiences front and centre and take the whole organisation   along on a journey with us . We knew that we needed to develop deeper empathy to kindle the   value system we used to have in the organisation . We needed to prove that there was a bigger   message we had to convey . The message was to become more human - centric and we wanted to   show that by the topic we selected . 

 Application : 

 We have applied storytelling at diﬀerent moments in the process . ( 1 ) before the design thinking   session : once the topic was selected , we communicated the information about the topic and   design thinking session internally . We used stories of our colleagues and their struggles . The   support our colleagues got was incredible . So many people with disabilities and limitations came   out and started to talk about their own disabilities and limitations . These process has created a   base , which was not at all expected . This was the ﬁrst time , I experienced the power of   storytelling . ( 2 ) during ‘ what is ’ process : so many of our colleagues volunteered to tell their stories   ( interviews ) to design thinking participants . They all knew that by sharing their stories they would   be contributing to ﬁnd solutions to become a more inclusive organisation for people with   disabilities and limitations . Many of them opened their hearts to the interviewers . It was an   amazing process . ( 3 ) during ‘ what wows / what works process ’ : once the teams had their proposed   solutions , they also used storytelling to explain their solutions . ( 4 ) Once all the proposed solutions   were presented , the sponsor of the project selected one prototype to turn it into a reality . Then the   solution was introduced to the whole company , using storytelling ! 

 Insights : 

 - Storytelling is very powerful . It can inspire people . - It is extremely useful if you would like to convey a big message - It has to be constructed well , otherwise the message could be lost along the way - It could be less powerful in business topics ( this is just an assumption and should be tested ) - It has to be genuine , otherwise people will not follow you . 

 Approach : 

 - When I was communicating the stories of people , I did not use the real names of people ( since I 

 did not ask people if they wanted me to use their names or not ) . This approach was risk - averse   but less eﬀective . Later on some of them came back to me to ask me to use their real names .   This was much more powerful . The reaction to these stories were bigger and more emotional .   So I learned that next time I should ask permission before assuming that people would not like   to reveal themselves ...

"Example Reflection- <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 Working in an organization we often face challenges that ca n’t be resolved using traditional   way of problem solving , then we require to approach the challenge being more innovative   and there comes design thinking . After analyzing and researching the problem we come   across large quantity of data which might / might not be directly helpful in solving the   problem but could provide the important analysis about the problem which later on can be   used in finding creative solution . While working on problem that is irrelevant or unrelated to   any past experience like here , we needed to find the best to provide knowledge for seekers   that is effective and approachable for all the seekers anytime anywhere , then design   thinking becomes an important method in problem solving process . 

 Selection tool 

 When we analyze the problem could be an opportunity , drafting plan and researching is the   next step . While working and researching on broad field the large quantity researched data   needed to be managed and controlled efficiently . Here comes the tool mind mapping which   is really helpful in managing and controlling the large quantity of data collected during   exploration of what problems and concerns are needed to be resolved .   Mind mapping   becomes very helpful in extracting the insights and pattern from the data collected . This   tool also helps in finding the way to what if stage . Also , when many stakeholders are   involved in the process it helps to cover the broader field as this tool involves the large no   people with diverse thinking and requirements and simultaneously provides deeper   approach to the problem . This tool is a creative , visual and engaging process which in turn   provide great insights . 

 Application 

 As mentioned the example of yard sale in the book- Growth by Fatima Hardy & Mark Turvey , mind mapping became very helpful in our situation . By arranging a fest we managed   to approach large no of people and asked them to provide their insights regarding the way   of learning they prefer and the way they find more efficient in today ’s world and why , what   do they expect and what are their concerns with today ’s way of seeking knowledge . 

 What insights we got from this process turns out to be very different that we were   expecting the concerns could be . Through this mind mapping tool we became more aware   about that exactly the seeker expects and demands . This process turned out to be very   effective as it captured the and represented the mind of our customers and also developed   common mind regarding the current reality among colleagues . 

 Insight 

 The insights we collected by our data were numerable , but after interacting with large   diverse mass the insights turns out to be move diverse that what we expected . This helped 

 us to get more clarity about the customers concerns and needs . This process gave us a new   data and helped us extract meanings from it , and help us see in the direction and pattern    that we might have ignored if this process was not involved in for finding the solution . This   lead us to see the whole scenario through the seekers perspective , made us to engage   ourself in more relevant and customer oriented solution . 

 Approach 

 On practical application of this process no doubt this tool is very efficient , effective in   finding the reality of problem . This allows us to find the true concerns due to which the   problem immerged . In the changing world with diverse customers with diverse   requirements this tool will help find us the true causes of problem which will lead from   correct what is to correct what if stage . This tool surely going to be our effective prop in   design thinking process in future .

"Reflection about Storytelling tool use 

 <ADDRESS> and selection 

 I work developing technological solutions with different purposes for the transport sector . One of   the major concerns of insurers , emergency agencies and local authorities , mainly in developing   countries , is the high road accident rate for motorcyclists , as well as the fatality associated with   this type of accidents . In this sense , a highway concessionaire challenged us to propose a solution   that would reduce the occurrence of accidents by at least twenty percent on one of the roads that   have concessionaires in a South American country . 

 With the knowledge we had of innovation at that time , we considered that the <NAME> tool   would be quite useful to make a good characterization of motorcycle riders . Storytelling is a tool   that allows to reach a deep knowledge of the objective user , in this case the motorcyclists ,   through that emotional connection that is generated when we tell our life stories or when others   tell us theirs , where we let ourselves be seen spontaneously our essence , what we do ( we say , we   see , we hear ) and what we think ; that is , what we are , which is an invaluable source of   information in the phase of identifying the origin of a problem . 

 Application 

 During the development of the first phase of the project we had the opportunity to talk in depth   with about twenty motorcycle riders of both genders , of different age ranges , various professions ,   and different accident records . In their life stories , most of them revealed important topics about   their motivations and concerns about driving . 

 In their stories , many of them agreed that their greatest concern was the lack of recognition of   them in the road context and the insecurity that they were subjected to by criminals who had   them as one of their objectives to steal their motorcycle and their belongings . For this reason ,   many of them justified their way of driving , which sometimes became reckless . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This exercise allowed us to obtain valuable first - hand information on the origin of some unsafe   behaviors that triggered the occurrence of road accidents involving motorcyclists . From this   information , we were able to carry out quite enriching ideation sessions that , after being duly   valued , subsequently consolidated into a proposed solution to be implemented in its early   development stage . 

 The <NAME> and the other tools seen in the course are valuable resources that , properly used ,   potentiate the development of innovative solutions for specific problems . 

 I ca n’t pass up the opportunity to congratulate you for the content of the course , but above all , for   your dedication to achieve an understanding of all the concepts .

"Challenge & selection 

 As a technical consultant working on SIM & relevant services , we remarked recently an   increase of issues after SIM Cards creation in customer warehouse . This situation is   generating many reworks and in worst cases SIM cards are not usable anymore . The   consequence was the increase the cost of quality most of time so impacting the margin of   the company and its reputation . 

 In order to understand the issue , our manager has decided to have a task force in order to   try to identify the root cause of this solution . 

 After a little introduction to design thinking concept , we decided to use mind mapping tool   which is using most of time to find patterns and same themes in ideas . We selected this tool   because we wanted to find patterns between all the ideas we will collect during the idea   generation process ( what is ) in order the find the root cause and the best solution . 

 Application 

 We decided to do the exercise during a seminar as most of team members were available .   We made four teams of 3 persons . The objective was to provide lot of answers for the   following question “ Why are we facing with reworks after SIM card creation ? “ . All the   participants wrote on a piece of paper , one or more potential reasons he was able to find   during 15 minutes . 

 We got many answers as expected ( around 20 answers ) . We stacked all the pieces of papers   on a white board and then try identify patterns . To do so , we group answers by affinities in   different columns . We then give a description to each bloc and after this exercise , we   managed to classify these answers into three main groups : “ Wrong requirements definition   from Customers ” , “ Acceptance tests not well executed by customers ” & “ Technical   acceptance tests complex , long & boring ” . 

 After finding the main potential root causes , we decided to do some propositions of   solutions ( what if ) . We got as examples of solutions : 

 -   Customer training about SIM cards technologies & services delivered by our team 

 -   the implementation of templates of requirements to be checked by customers 

 -   the development of an automatic checking tool 

 The final purpose was to select between these solutions in order to find one or at maximum   two . Thus , we got as main potential solutions : the implementation of templates of   requirements to be checked by customers and the development of an automatic checking   tool . 

 With management team , we decided to develop firstly the automatic checking tool as it will   allow technical team as well as Customers to do check quickly and have a report of potential   errors on applications and SIM specifications based on their requirements . 

 This tool will be used by a little population of technical team and customers . We will then   observe if any improvement has been done on the challenge we were facing before . 

 Insight & approach 

 By applying the mind mapping tool , our team manage from a specific issue to find a great   solution which was far away from our expectation . It allow the development team to use an   agile approach by starting implementing the main tests proposed by day to day users . And   only after one month we remarked that we started to save time spent during testing process   and that tests were well executed because they were done automatically and efficiently by   the tool . 

 This tool will be used broadly in our team because as technical consultant , we are always   facing with issues and it is challenge to always find the good solution . The mind mapping   appears as the good one to use in that situation and I understand from our workshop that it   can be coupled with learning launch for a more satisfying result . 

"
"Reflection – Visualization Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve   a shared understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of   stakeholders before attempting to identify and define possible solutions to the   problem . I use this approach often with our customers , who are government   agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission   or the delivery of their services to their customer , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens ,   businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the technique of using a straw man   visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for   discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in   the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships   between elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities   for improvements or solutions . Application I start the process by creating a   straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man graphic , I   will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment .   The existing material may be operational or procedural documents , training   materials , marketing materials , GAO or other auditing reports . If materials are   not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the   stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . If   appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back- stage ” from previous research , and discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The   Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage approach helps to reinforce   the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with   whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the   organization to provide the service . The template I often start with also has a   column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain Providers and a column   on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO , labor   unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how   the organization operates . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple   shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If the front - stage / back- stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual , either   based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders ,   or another format . For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of   5 - 6 participants each representing a different organization or area of interest .   Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can   write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three   questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the 

 graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make it more   accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about   the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I give them   approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic .   Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three questions   while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I   record commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional   insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the   graphic . After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a   view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion ,   and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and   proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . Insight & Approach What I   have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while   the graphic – especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback –   is important for reinforcing their understanding of the problem they are   working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights   and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for   discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights   into potential root causes of their problems . While they could create the   graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man   jump starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they   are in the graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new   insights about relationships between key entities instead of taking time to   identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it   helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to   obtain information or data to provide the values for the variables . Since I   discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning ,   next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of   design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their   combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of   their work .

 First ,   I   had   to   discuss   my   idea   with   the   head   of   the   school ,   as   well   as   in   a   meeting   having   the   presence    of   other   teachers   and   the   parents   of   these   youngsters .   In   fact ,   it   was   at   this   meeting   that   I   got   to   know    that   everyone   was   particularly   concerned   about   the   situation .   I   was   able   to   secure   approval   from   the    management    of    the    school    to    always    have    a    15    minutes    “ talk    time ”    every    Thursday    morning    gatherings .   Through   this   platform ,   I   was   able   to   share   my   story ,   especially   how   I   was   able   to   survive    being   born   in   a   low‐income   family .   I   was   also   able   to   invite   people   who   share   a   similar   background   as    mine   and   were   very   successful   in   their   careers   to   come   and   talk   with   the   students   about   how   they    have   been   able   to   achieve   their   career   goals .   During   this   program ,   we   did   not   forget   to   let   the   pupils    know   the   importance   of   speaking   up ,   especially   when   faced   with   challenges   that   may   seem   impossible    to   overcome‐examples   of   which   may   include   loss   of   one ’s   parent / guardian ,   financial   difficulty ,   abuse    of   any   kind ,   etc .   I   used   this   opportunity   to   share   a   story   of   how   I   lost   my   mother   when   I   was   in   school    and   how   it   affected   me   to   the   point   of   almost   dropping   out   of   college   until   I   opened   up   to   my   advisor    who   helped   me   to   overcome   the   problem .   This   really   made   the   students   a   lot   more   confident   about    discussing   their   problems   with   the   advisors   appointed   by   the   school ,   of   which   I   happened   to   be   among .    By   talking   with   these   students ,   I   discovered   that   majority   had   lost   interest   in   school   because   they    lacked   real‐life   mentors   who   they   could   look   up   to   and   draw   inspiration   from .   To   put   in   a   summary ,    one   particular   student   told   me   that   ‘ there   was   nothing   for   them   out   there ’   after   graduation   from    college . 

 INSIGHT 

 Through   this   means   of   storytelling ,   I   have   been   able   to   personally   connect   with   my   students ,   especially    in   those   other   things   that   I   would   not   have   imagined   could   be   a   problem .   Previously ,   I   would   not   have    thought   that   the   apathy   towards   school‐related   activities   could   have   been   hugely   influenced   by   the    seemly   bleak   situation   in   my   society .    Having   found   this   out ,   we   have   been   able   to   establish   a   network    of   successful   professionals   who   now   provide   all   sorts   of   support   systems ,   which   have   led   to   a   practical    solution   to   the   problem ,   not   just   to   my   school ,   but   to   other   schools   within   my   vicinity .   This   has   also    made   us   think   within ,   such   as   revising   our   school   curriculum   to   cover   the   prevalent   situation   in   my    society .   Presently ,   rather   than   teaching   the   students   about   studying   to   be   gainfully   employed ,   we   now    focus   more   on   entrepreneurial   skills   in   our   day   to   day   teachings   in   the   classroom .   And   the   good   news 

 STORYTELLING 

 is   that   more   and   more   students   have   started   returning   to   school   because   there   are   people   who   are    always   available   to   listen   and   provide   solutions   to   their   problems . 

 APPROACH 

 To   be   quite   honest ,   even   though   I   was   not   aware   that   I   was   making   use   of   one   of   the   four   design    thinking   tools   highlighted   in   this   course   to   solve   a   problem ,   I   do   not   think   I   would   have   used   a   different    approach   considering   the   demographic   age   group   I   was   dealing   with .   Though ,   I   must   acknowledge    that   if   this   knowledge   had   been   common ,   this   problem   would   not   have   lingered   long   enough   to   the    point   of   causing   the   students   to   lose   interest   in   school .

"Visualizing an Error - Free QC Process 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of our company ’s Quality Control ( QC ) team . My job is to make sure that all of the   materials we review are accurate for spelling and grammar , as well as content . It is important that the   materials reflect our brand standards and also contain the correct dates and price points . 

 There were errors on a large number of the pieces we were reviewing . These errors ranged from spelling   to dates to inconsistencies in content . The team was receiving outdated or inaccurate information that   prevented us from ensuring that the correct content was being reviewed . 

 The errors and omissions did not seem specific to type of material or department . The challenge was to   try to determine why we were seeing a large error rate and to find ways to enable reduction in those   rates . 

 One of the key challenges was that the QC team   works with different departments and teams within   each department so we not only have a large scope of work , we also have a large number of people   involved who work on different teams and we were not aware of all of the other team ’s processes . 

 Selection 

 In order to help figure out what was going on , we used the visualization tool . One of the things I struggle   with is taking a large , broad concept and figuring out what it actually looks like . I find it difficult to see all   the cogs that make a machine work and that is why using the visualization tool really helped in our   situation . 

 <NAME> <NAME> spoke in her video about how visualization can help you realize what is important . It allows   you to see things differently and hone in on what is important . It can help trigger conversations and   ideas , as well as helping a team to arrive at shared conclusions . We thought that using the visualization   tool could help our team to try and determine what was going on . 

 Application 

 Our team met with a few others and we used the visualization tool to help us determine what was going   on . We drew a number of diagrams on a white chalkboard . One of our diagrams involved following a QC   submission through its path , beginning with its origin . We drew a square representing each team and   then a line off the square that contained what information should be attached by the team . 

 Then , we drew another square for the second team and lines off of that square saying what info was   added or removed before it advanced and so on . Essentially , at this step it looked like a train with lines   off of each car .   This was a really helpful step . It enabled me to see the entire process of a submission   from the very beginning until the final resolution . It also stimulated discussion among our team 

 members . Once we completed the first train . We circled steps that were being left out or could be   improved . 

 We used color Post - Its to track what steps were necessary , neutral , or could be eliminated ( red , yellow ,   and green Post - Its ) . These two visual tools let us all view our process in a similar way . We were able to   fill in the gaps and do a step - by - step trace to determine how we could help the system improve to   reduce errors . 

 The visualization tool was very effective . 

 Insight 

 The visualization too was really interesting and informative .   I was surprised by how deep it went and   how much it revealed . We were able to determine that a lot of the errors were occurring b / c the   protocol was not being followed . The train diagram revealed that sometimes teams were skipped ;   occasionally protocol was n’t followed ; and that not everyone was aware of all of the tools at their   disposal . 

 The design thinking course in general taught me about different ways to look at problems and I really   like the “ what is , what if , what wows , what works ” approach . I work in an organization that thrives on   looking at things differently . This course spoke on a lot of unique and different ways to approach a   problem and utilize different ways of thinking . I loved the idea of “ what if ” . What if we can look   outside of the constraints , what if we could think about things without some of the barriers . I liked the   idea of freeing our thinking to look at different possibilities and then reel it in to what works . 

 Approach 

 The visualization tool was both useful and helpful for this project . If I were to redo the assignment , I ’d   broaden the scope a bit and use storytelling and visualization to train other teams . We could share   the stories of what we have noticed in patterns with examples and we could utilize visualization to   illustrate some of the procedures and projects , which would make them easier to understand for all   teams .

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I work for a large company . We have offices in 10 different countries and hundreds of 

 workers . I am in charge of the development of the tool most of them use for work every 

 day . 

 As you may imagine , communication in an environment with so many different people , 

 languages and different cultural backgrounds is not easy .   We had   problems before 

 developing the tool in the right direction because of misunderstandings between the 

 different offices and us , or even between the developers and me . 

 I decided to try <NAME> as a way to improve the communication . Storytelling would 

 help everyone understand each other , being more empathic , and bring context at every 

 stage of communication . 

 Application 

 Briefly , my work consist in talking to the countries , gathering their problems and needs , 

 then , communicating these to developers that will build tools for them . 

 I used storytelling in 2 different ways : 

 When I talk to the local offices : 

 Before , they used to tell me : “ Hey <NAME> , next to the car information , we need a button 

 that sends an email to the previous owner . ” 

 Now , I ask them more questions , and force them to build a story . They will go for 

 something like : “ When the worker finish the inspection of a car and save the report , he 

 usually goes to the list . Then he needs to send an email to the previous owner of the car to 

 confirm the transaction . ” 

 When I define the task for the team of developers : 

 Before , I will just communicate : “ We need a new button next to the car information that 

 sends an email to the previous owner . ” 

 Now , I will explain the entire story to the developers . We will go through the task together 

 and , usually , we find better solutions . E.g. In the previous case , one of the developers 

 proposed to automate the email delivery , as it always needed to happen . 

 In this case , storytelling improved the communication , brought more context and made 

 everyone understand each other ’s needs . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Storytelling helped with the communication , forced us to always think about the context , 

 and help the programmers think in how a worker is doing his job . 

 It also brought empathy in the company to these departments . My office is a pure 

 technical office ( we work only with computers developing digital tools ) . The rest of the 

 offices have tools , inspectors , cars … For us , it is very easy to lose context and not being 

 able to relate to who is using our tools . Storytelling helped us to think in each other , to be 

 more empathic . 

 There are more people in my company doing my same job . I am trying to make them 

 understand how well this change worked for me , although , they are quite afraid of 

 changes . 

 I think this course gave me a few tools I can use at work . To improve communication , to 

 bring new ideas to the company and , finally , to get my job done better .

"Challenge 

 The Covid-19 pandemic was one of the worst health crises that shut down all   economies for the first time in history . However , it impacted the healthcare sector   specifically as there were not many support applications and systems that were   equipped to deal with this number of patients in terms of tracking and monitoring . 

 The healthcare challenge that we as a team faced during the beginning of the pandemic   was to establish an easy - to - use technology to monitor and track employees who test   positive / negative for covid 19 apart of the covid-19 company initiative . 

 The project had multiple stakeholders internally and externally such as IT Department ,   Corporate Communications and external such as 3rd party software developers . 

 The timeline for the project was to create a prototype in 4 weeks with the involvement of   all stakeholders . The plan was for IT , and 3rd party software company to develop a beta   prototype . Once the prototype was completed , the corporate communications team will   assist in the go to market strategy . 

 Selection : 

 The team have agreed to utilize the learning launch tool as the tool is designed to assist   in developing a seamless technology for all users through careful experimentation to   create value generated assumptions apart of the covid 19 initiative . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. ,   what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 The first launch we focused on providing an easy - to - use beta mobile application that   runs on IOS with only the location feature to ensure the team captures all needed   information about covid cases . 

 The main focus was to collect , process and observe data related to covid cases .   However , after 1 week of data collection , observation and brainstorming , the team   concluded that the application requires additional improvements using a more human   centric approach . 

 Therefore , the team have launched the 2nd version of the application with adaptability on   Android and added features such as real time location , facial recognition , and contact   tracing capabilities . 

 Our second launch was to release the new platform to a group of farmers to see how   they will interact with it . Our focus was to observe to see if there were any gaps .   Through this process it helped us understand our market and what our users   considered simple . After testing the second platform we conducted interviews with the   farmers who interacted with it to understand their experiences and to find out if this 

 second prototype was easy to navigate . Our priority was to ensure that the farmers   could use the platform with ease . 

 • Insight 

 We applied the learning tool via the learning approach where the team was able to   design and test the optimal application through rapid experimentation and continuously   improving to meet a human centric user base . 

 However , through the process , the team have learned that incorporating several design   thinking tools can be beneficial such as utilizing the storytelling and Visualization   activities to develop a marketing campaign for the application . 

 • Approach : 

 For our team , we saw the learning launch tool as the suitable tool for our challenge .   However , as a team the next steps would be to revise the application and insights from   the 2 versions for future lessons learned .

"CATEGORY CENTRALIZATION         ( Learning Launch Tool ) 

 Challenge & Selection      I work in a commercial department of one of the leading retail companies and to keep up   with the evolving markets , customer demands and expectations , digitalization , etc . , using   Learning Launch Tool has become part of my life .    In order to increase stock availability , sales and footfall into our stores year on year , whilst   protecting the bottom line and profitability , as well as the limited budget and resources ,   every new project is given a timeline and detailed critical path to keep the project   constructive and productive .    The last challenging project was linked to a particular category centralization ( at that time   decentralized ) and involved members of different internal departments and external   stakeholders , with the focus on implementation of centralization in 1 smaller regional   market within the 3 months . The purpose of Learning Launch is to get to the truth – identify   all internal and external challenges within the B2C workflow and the current ways of   working . The truth saves money , time and should the assumptions be correct , the benefits   for the category and the business would be substantial .     Application      The process started with the focus on the current ways of working , resources , processes ,   systems , data and efficiency . Involving key stakeholders and decision makers of each   department / market , short structured meetings and surveys have been set up with clear   agenda to identify all the pros and cons , what ’s available to us today and what ’s not and   what would be the key elements to address , to overcome all potential block stopper . We ’ve   set up a number of different teams and each team has been allocated specific tasks to   deliver within specific timeframe . All tasks have been reviewed and further challenged until   all the gaps have been clearly identified .    It was during this stage when it became evident that current ways of working , processes and   system constrains are the main challenges . Hence , we needed to create few workshops   during which all challenges were addressed , data quality and quantity has been reviewed   and in a collaborative way , new assumptions and solutions were identified .    The next step was to create a very clear critical path , prioritizing all the tasks , setting up new   processes and new ways of working ( including training ) , with the aim to track / get detailed   visibility into the project and to deliver it within the given timeframe and budget .       Insight & Approach      Throughout the whole process , the top management were fully aware of all the   observations and assumptions that came out by applying <NAME> <NAME> tool , the   necessary steps that needed to be taken to meet the category / business needs . And rightly   so , on many occasions we were challenged back . By applying <NAME> <NAME> tool , no stone   should be left unturned . 

 The actual initial results and insights delivered further internal challenges , which we were   able to identify and solve within a very short time frame . And moving forward with the next   market centralization , we were able to incorporate them in the future planning process .    Learning Launch tool plays a significant role within our business or in any fast paste   environment . Reflect , Review , Incorporate . And as long as all the steps are followed ,   reviewed and challenged and reviewed again , the future gains are unthinkable . 

"
"Challenge 

 In today ’s highly competitive work environment , the organization that trains in the most effective 

 and efficient manner possible will always gain the cutting edge . The toughest part of being a training 

 professional is to ensure learner engagement .   It refers to the degree of attention , curiosity , interest , 

 optimism , and passion that leaners exhibit when they are learning which extends to the level of 

 motivation they have to learn and progress in their education . The passive approaches employed for 

 the past generation of learners are now obsolete . Classrooms and lectures are now slowly becoming 

 a thing of the past . 

 Selection 

 It was the need of the hour for me to come up with active learning methods to ensure learner 

 engagement . So , I decided to adopt storytelling .   Stories have been around for millennia . Ancient 

 cultures used them to pass on traditions and wisdom to subsequent generations . In corporate 

 training , storytelling is a medium that can be used in new hire training ( introducing new employees 

 to the company ’s history , goals and visions ) , product training ( the story behind the creation of a 

 certain product and its uses , including testimonials ) , application training ( the steps involved to move 

 from point A to point B ) and soft skills training ( e.g. , the consequences of poor time management 

 and how to rectify it ) . I decided to employ story telling in all these four types of training programs 

 carried out in my organization . According to the video lecture on storytelling , it is about the 

 connection that we give to people about a piece of information that we 're trying to share . A good 

 story at it ’s essence , is simply conveying a message that has logic . 

 Application 

 The foundation of a great story starts with knowing the audience . Sometimes we make a lot of 

 assumptions about who our audience is . Mostly , we assume that they are like us and that is not 

 always the case . I also often see organizations too broadly define their audience , which is also not 

 helpful . So , before starting any training program , I decided to go for a thorough discovery process to 

 get to know the real audience including their demographics and previous experiences . The second 

 part of a good story is a clear sequence of events . A great story is characterized by a clear sequence 

 of events that moves it from the beginning to an end and has its moments of reflection . So , I took 

 extra care is arranging the story in proper order to ensure that the audience will be able to capture 

 the essence of it . The third part is about selecting the most appropriate story which suits the 

 context . There 's a variety of stories that a trainer can tell during the training program . So , I do a lot 

 of research to narrow down the story that best fits the situation and suits the audience . 

 Insights 

 Including story telling as an integral tool in the training process was a fruitful exercise for me . In the 

 process of getting to know my audience better , I was able to uncover their soft , mushy emotional 

 side . As much as forming an emotional connection is important , I was able to help the audience see 

 parts of themselves ( or their lives ) in the story . The biggest insight I got was the fact that ultimately , 

 the audience is n’t concerned about you , your process or your expertise . They are concerned about 

 how the message you are there to deliver is going to impact the business , from whatever 

 perspective they see it . In understanding this , I see the importance of customising my message . 

 Customisation involves knowing who you are speaking with , what drives them and then determining 

 the best way to connect with that audience . 

 <NAME> 

 So , next time , I will ensure that all my training programs will be learner centred rather than being 

 content centred or trainer centred .   First , I will think before I speak . Before I speak , I will construct 

 the story . And to construct the story , I will think about my audience and consider the world from 

 their perspective . It ’s not about me , the trainer – it ’s about them and the business . To communicate 

 my story effectively , trainer must be heard . To be heard , I must connect with my audience with a 

 message that is relevant to them , and delivered in a way they can understand . 

"
"Peer Graded Assignment 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Story telling is a very powerful tool . An interesting story gain the attention of its listeners , and when   the listeners pay attention , they surely learn something from it . An impressive story can boost   someone confidence and take someone imagination and dreams to the next level . 

 I work with team of developers . Most of them are from less standard universities . They have a lack   of confidence and they fear from errors and mistakes . Most of the time when they make a mistake ,   they left the work and declare that they should leave that job and they can not do nothing . They   think they can not achieve in life etc . Most of them are the ones who have dealt with domination and   maladjusted in every stage of lives , they must be endowed and motivation is a path to endowment .   At those times , me with my partner , try to share some stories of our past work that how do we came   at this level . When we share our stories and our bad experiences to such kind of people , it boost   their confidence and moral that these are people like us , if they can achieve it then we can also   achieve it . That ’s the best part of the story telling . Motivation is the core of storytelling . Your story   must be strong enough to motivate at least one individual and you have done your part . 

 Application 

 I have a story to tell about usage of storytelling , how I make it work for someone . I was leading a   project . A development of software . Where I have to incorporate new juniors who had very less   experience of programming and development . I was already explaining the management that we   have to show some confidence in them to boost their motivation and moral so that they put their   best efforts . Appreciation is the foremost requirement of healthy working environment .   Appreciation and showing confidence can make a non - skilled person a very good professional . We   can rely on a person who is motivated to learn no matter if he or she is not yet skilled . Basically a   small software house work closely with its employees . Normally a boss sits very close to the   developers . This makes a very tight environment to work with . One day I came to the office and I see   that one of the developer was deciding to leave the job . When I asked the reason of doing so , he   said that he is getting too many errors , this work is beyond his capabilities and he should leave .   While other developers were trying to get things done . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This was very shocking and surprising for me that due to temporary bugs and errors , this guy was   destroying his career , because where ever he will go , he will face the same issues , so it ’s better to   learn how to face them , instead of how to avoid them . Then I told him the story of computer   networking course assignment . I told him I did n’t know about coding . I was too depressed that how I   am going to do that and how my friends left me alone in this work . I told him how I took help from   seniors , worked day and night to overcome coding skills deficiency , and submitted my work on time   alone with help and guidance of seniors . After listening this story , the guy sat still for a while . After   that he gave a positive smile and told me that he is going to try again and again until it is get done . 

 I also shared this story in workshops and I guess it make a very significant impression on people   professional lives . Work environment have to be reformed and the developers must be given a free 

 relax environment where they can work in their own style and show productivity . A little piece of   motivational story can a novice one to professional one . 

 Design thinking in business innovation has sparked a new dimension in my thinking process . Now I   analyze situations more positively rather than negatively . I think more optimistic and make   motivational stories to move forward the concept and idea of positivity in society as well . 

 I have done BS Computer Science , had worked as a programmer , now I am into business side ,   helping companies to establish . Spreading the design thinking knowledge in the field of business is   one of my motivation now .

"STORYTELLING TOOL 

 CHALLANGE ’S DESCRIPTION 

 Working as a volunteer in Clinic of Marrow Transplantation , Oncology and Haematology in   Childhood , I constantly experience child ’s fear of injections . This problem has an adverse influence on   a patient ’s immunology system because high stimulation activates the emergency resources within   the organism and can lead even to exhaustion . It causes patient   stressed , nervous and distrustful . As   a result ,   also parents usually feel helpless , react with frustration or anger – because they do not   know how to effectively urge their child to break down the resistance or stop hysteria .   The medical   staff has also difficulties to proceed the proper treatment while attempting to reassure a “ fighting ”   child . 

 Having faced such a problematic situation , I challenged myself to find a way of exploring factors that   could decrease the stress and to accustom the patients with such a situation . 

 TOOL SELECTION 

 I chose a tool that is close to their childhood , usually close to their safe zone in everyday reality   outside the clinic . That ’s why I decided to apply storytelling . Through imaginary , I wanted to help   understand children what the current state was and to show the redesign story of the future .   This   action might enable patients to experience the change in our multi - possibilities world . With this tool ,   I wanted to connect with the children ’s emotions , showing that fear is a natural reaction of our   organism . We do n’t need to negate it but to accept it and help ourselves to overcome the   stressogenic factors . 

 I applied the storytelling tool , from the co - creation perspective , to gain better understanding of   patients ’ sense of meaning , focusing on the whole ecosystem of the stressogenic situation – what   can help build a feeling of safety and trust . 

 I started to apply the storytelling tool with an 8 - year - old girl . 

 TOOL APPLICATION 

 Having listened the patient , her parents and nurses , I decided to use within the storytelling process   the real medical object ( e.g. a syringe , disinfectants ) and the patient ’s baby - doll . I asked the girl to   pick up also roles for us . She decided that the baby - doll would be the patient , she – the doctor , and   me – the patient ’s mum . While telling the story I was asking questions about the baby doll ’s feelings ,   what she was afraid of , what mum could do with that , what position was comfort , what could help   the doctor to conduct the treatment as quickly as possible , if telling a story ( within the story ) or a   poem would help the baby - doll patient during the injection . I navigated the story basing on the girl ’s   answers and tried to inspire her with new possibilities during the whole story . 

 When we finished , I asked the girl if she wanted to participate the story once again but that time we   could change the roles . Surprisingly , she said she would be the patient and me – the doctor . And I   retold the story one more time but using the girl ’s preferences suggested previously . 

 Then I shared my observations with girl ’s parents . I ’ve also talked to the child psychotherapists ,   working in the clinic , about the situation . The storytelling tool integrated all people that were like   puzzles of the picture creating the integrative environment   supporting the child . Further , there were   also some visualizing tools developed – like a champion ’s calendar that motivated the child to   challenge her systematically everyday and to master herself within 4 zones : joy , perseverance ,   gratitude and powerful thoughts . 

 INSIGHT 

 Thanks to the storytelling tool I could understand much deeper what the patient had   been struggled with , I obtained unique answers and broadened my perspective of the   challenge . I could accompany the girl in her way to discover more healthy solutions , that   lied inside her , to tackle the situation . I had a feeling that the real value was not only in   listening the story but in co - creation the story - in experiencing better reality   that could   bring safety , trust and peace . 

 This tool was a starting point to iterate by parents , nurses , doctors and child therapists ,   new solutions that could support the patient . To complement their knowledge ,   experience , abilities and practice . As a result , the girl , supported with the whole   ecosystem of relations , not only could live through the difficult emotions for her ,   find the   solutions to decrease the level of stress , get more familiar with the treatment   but also   she discovered that she liked helping people , taking care of them and being in charge of   responsible tasks . On her coming birthday , she wanted to get a toy medical set for   doctors . 

 APPROACH 

 I believe DT is a method that does n’t apply innovative tools but to apply the tools , that   have already existed , in an innovative , creative way . It brings value in people ’s life   trough adjusting the solutions according to unique needs . 

 Moreover , I found useful my professional experience gained within seemingly distinct ,   business environments . Thanks to my translation practice I was aware of translating not   only words but the meaning and the language into personal discourse . Working within   Purchasing and Logistic Department , I understand the significance of the relation within   the value supply chain and the importance of one coherent story co - creation .   My   interests in marketing , CSR and NGO made me realize that uniting people with   interdisciplinary experiences under a clear idea can definitely create something that is   much more important than ourselves . That ’s why people are not to supplement each   other but to complement each other . Simply , people need people .

 For this challenge , I select VISUALIZATION design tool . 

 The visualization is a really core component of the way that we communicate , whether we 're aware   of it or not . When we 're dealing with very complex problems , we 're actually enacting a different kind   of problem solving that has to bring in more than just logic . We 're actually doing extrapolation . We 're   doing inductive reasoning . We 're thinking about possibilities that we have n't yet seen . So that kind of   imaginative work really has to be brought out by exercising and understanding that right side of our   brain . So getting in the habit of doing visualization is actually a way of cultivating that side of our brain   work . Visualization is really important . For the process of design because it 's actually a way of   unlocking a different part of brain . 

 APPLICATION 

 The visualization tool is a powerful tool . It is the perfect tool to be used in such situation . 

 New ideas for products and services are conceived every day — yet many of them fail because they   were n’t properly introduced to the market . Market research helps ensure both that the product   launch will hit the ‘ right buttons ’ in the consumer , and ensures that the product idea itself addresses   the ( often unspoken ) desires of the customer . 

 Market research often reveals counter intuitive facts about your market , even if you think you are   already well acquainted with it . For example , research has shown that ‘ snacks ’ are often used as a   meal substitute , and that therefore successful confectionery - type snack products tend to be more   ‘ foody ’ than one might expect : ingredients like cereal , peanuts , biscuits , and fruit which help break up   the overall chocolate are very well received by customers . 

 Similarly , the tool visualization helped me know how to effectively launch this xyz flagship product of   this giant corporation . 

 INSIGHT 

 Using design visualization tool allowed me to think in a nonverbal way . It allowed me to access parts   of brain , parts of creativity , that I might not normally be using in the course of conversation . Most   people will tell you , especially in the business world , that they are not artistic and they can not draw .   Visualization is n't really about drawing , though . It 's actually about visual thinking , and we all do it .   What I 've seen is that through practice , you can actually get better and better at doing it . Visualization   is anything from the things we write on a chalkboard or a whiteboard . To the images that we create   in a PowerPoint presentation , to photography , video . It 's basically anything that takes us beyond just 

 using words or language alone . Things like color . Things like symbols for example . If you 're looking at   logos and the way that companies represent the , represent themselves as a brand . Those are all ways   to enact a more visual understanding . When we 're talking and we 're verbalizing things we see things   internally , but we may all be understanding the words in a slightly different way . The beauty of using   visualization is that we can tap into a single picture . The more you begin to use pictures , the more that   you begin to diagram while you talk , and create a visual image for people of how you are thinking .   The , the more likely you are to achieve a sense of agreement and consensus with people , the more   you are likely to draw out conversation . In an environment where your , your ability to , to get things   done and to solve problems is dependent on other people being able to understand you and align   their ideas with yours . 

 APPROACH 

 Storytelling would be the approach if I had the chance to solve this challenge differently . I think what   storytelling does for leaders in terms of strategy , is it makes it simple . It makes it relate - able , It gives   strategy color , and life In character and plot . And it , allows the line worker , working your   manufacturing unit to vice president running marketing to have the same understanding of what we 're   trying to do . And so for me , those are two reasons , and there 's a number more about why storytelling   is an essential tool for leaders to become competent in and experts in as they move forward . 

 So , going with the storytelling way , it would have made a different and simpler solution .

"EXAMPLE REFLECTION - VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGE AND <ADDRESS> 

 The tool that I found the most reliable was the visualization tool . This tool is more likely to   achieve a sense of agreement and consensus with people because as I talk , I am able to give   a visual image to people . This tool primarily unlocks a different part of the brain and a lot of   imagination comes into the picture . I often use this tool to approach the customers , investors   and other stakeholders while bringing a new product to the market . I have used this tool   several times to persuade my customers the worthiness of the business idea . The business   idea is usually explained by using various figures and animated characters in my presentation   so that the business idea is visually communicated to the customers . The animated characters   explain the scope , the technology used , the security and other needful details for the   customers through the presentation . 

 APPLICATION 

 I start the process by thinking what necessary information is required to launch the product .   Then I analyse my target customers and their necessities . I make my product in such a way   that I would be able to bridge a gap in the community . After the brainstorming process I bring   the ideas generated together and hand over the thought to my graphics department . They   bring in animated characters to the business idea that I generated to attract the customers .   The presentation is made in such a way that the customers feel satisfied with the product .   The animated presentation is easier to communicate than talking to the customers in layman   language . The presentations show the latest technology used in making the product , how the   customer ’s needs are met , the reliable price and the other necessary factors . The business   ideas usually generated are rare , valuable and inimitable . These factors are conveyed properly   through the animated presentations . Visualisation tool helps in gaining the customers trust   especially when it is a new product or venture . It also unlocks a different part of the brain that   is allows to think creatively and innovatively . The creativity that I bring in would be difficult   for the other competing firms to copy or redesign . Then after the presentation is done , a   question session is held where the customers can ask questions about the product and the   answers are given in such a way that all the queries are cleared . This process is done before   the actual launch of the product to know the certain group of customers feedback . After   receiving the feedback , we tend to incorporate their wants in our product or otherwise in the   upcoming projects . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 What I have learnt while conducting a presentation with visualisation tool is that it attracts   customers attraction or anybody ’s attention to the presentation . It is easier to communicate   with the audience about the business idea . The audience will have a track of what our   thoughts and imaginations are . Visual representation can be remembered easily . It makes the   explanation or the business idea free of doubts in the minds of the audience . The   questionnaire and feedback session help us to understand the features that we are missing   and what all are the necessary actions to incorporate . 

 I would use this tool in my future projects also because of all the explained above points . I   feel this tool is better than the other tools because it does not play with the audience ’s   feelings and emotions like the story telling tool . Also , for a launch of a product or a venture   the visualisation tool is reliable and creates a lot of thought during the process . Thinking about   the idea more and more just increases the features to add on to it . This is the reason why I   stick onto the visualisation for all my projects

"Challenge 

 I was leading a team that was working on a project on marketing research where the team had   to understand the image of the client ’s brand and provide recommendations for improvements .   The management decision problem provided by the client put a lot of demand on resources   which were not plenty at the time . The team largely comprised of student volunteers who were   generally busy with the academic workload . 

 The expected outcome of the project was planning and execution of disguised marketing   research that allows for efficient data collection to gather authentic responses from the target   group . Hence the challenge before me was to define the research problem for the client   including all the variables . But this challenge extended to motivating the team members and   get creative ideas from them . 

 Selection 

 After analyzing all the scope of the issues and the possible repercussions , storytelling tool was   selected . Storytelling tool is uniquely positioned to address the need for optimizing the data   sharing among the team member for raising the engagement level . This aspect was especially   important for me as someone who held the leadership position . In this case , I could understand   the potential of the storytelling tool to empower me to affect the productivity both in terms of   the quality and quantity of the work done by other team members . I could also sense the   potential of the tool to help the other team members in connecting the dots in the research   process . This appreciation of their role in the project was expected to stimulate their creativity . 

 Application 

 The scope of the project seemed too big at the initial stages when the client provided the first   draft of the management problem . Coupled that with the resource constraint , the team had a   big challenge to overcome . The crucial task that I had as the team leader was to ensure that   each team member understands the entire research process to avoid any inefficiencies . This   understanding can also help in increasing the engagement level of the team members . Hence ,   we employed the storytelling tool by creating a narrative for the research process and the plan   for execution . Even the process of creating disguised marketing research plan heavily involved   creating a relatable context and active efforts to connect all the elements of the research   design . The storytelling tool also helped us explain the rationale behind all the activities that   the team members undertook as part of the project . The final research design was product of   improvements that were made after running small test runs of various versions . These efforts   to run small tests like pilots allowed for improving the research design by eliminating the   identified flaws in the design . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The team members during the project execution were found to have come up with numerous   creative solutions to the issues that they faced during the research process . By understanding   the role of each small task in the entire journey , the importance of each activity was clear to   the team members which allowed them to stay motivated and come up with creative ideas   whenever they faced any obstacle . The tool was also effective in creating a common ground for   the team and aligning the motivations of the entire team to work towards a common goal . The   same effect was likely to be achieved by visualization tool . Visualization , like storytelling would   have been helpful in creating a single holistic image of the research process that could have   driven the project execution with greater motivation among the team members , more creative   solutions and higher productivity .

"Visualization 

 Challenge 

 At the moment I am in my third year of university at the Faculty of Communication Design . This   means that I am engaged in design , which is related to communication between people or the   brand and the audience . I am engaged in the development of corporate styles , the creation of   posters and covers , packaging design , layout and much more . And every year I do more than   four educational projects on different topics . Each project must be presented . Presentation is   the topic of this essay . Since a lot depends on the presentation of the project , for example , the   perception of the project by listeners , the formation of their attitude to the project , and so on . 

 Selection 

 To present the concept of my projects , I use the visualization tool . It 's convenient and fast .   Most often , my projects have a complex unusual structure that is difficult to explain on the   fingers . 

 Application 

 Students have only a few minutes to present the project . And in order for the project to make a   proper impression , it is necessary that the teachers understand it . So I use visualizations in my   presentations . These are usually pictograms . These are simplified black - and - white images that   help to clearly see the mechanics of the project . My curator often uses pictographs in his   projects , as they are not personalized , which means that everyone can associate themselves   with these images . There is a visualization at the beginning of each of my presentations . In   addition to pictograms , these are usually photos and thematic pictures . For example , when I   talk about the target audience of the project , I try to show their photo so that the viewer can   understand what I 'm talking about . In addition , before starting the project , I am looking for   references ( pictures that are similar in style to what I want to do ) . I also show references in the   presentation to help the viewer tune in to the right mood and understand what will be   discussed in the next few minutes . Often references are formed into mudboards . Mudboards   are mood boards that also help create the right mood . 

 Insight 

 When I first started using the visualizations listed above , I realized how it makes it easier to   understand . I know everything about my projects because I 've been working on them for   several months . However , when I am faced with the task of telling another person about it in a   few minutes , some difficulties may arise . But the visualization tool helps me with this . Now I   use visualizations everywhere , for example , when I take notes , I make tables and diagrams ,   when it 's difficult for me to explain my idea to a friend , I draw it , and so on . Each person has   their own background , so when we try to explain something on our fingers , a person may not   understand , because for each person the semantic coloring of words is somewhat different .   However , when we use visualizations , everything becomes simpler and clearer . 

 Approach 

 In my field , visualization is a powerful communication tool . Therefore , I would not change   anything in my approach to tasks . Unless in the future I will use this tool more and more often .

"Design Thinking 

 Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The main instrument I utilized was the device of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to accomplish a mutual   comprehension of an issue space among a different gathering of partners before endeavoring   to   distinguish and characterize conceivable answers for the issue . I utilize this methodology regularly with   our clients , who are government offices attempting to apply innovation advancements to modernize   their main goal or the conveyance of their administrations to their client , which might be <ADDRESS> natives ,   organizations , and non - subjects . I have utilized the method of utilizing a straw man representation of an   issue area with an arrangement of inquiries or prompts for discourse to permit a different gathering of   partners to gain from one another during the time spent characterizing the extension , limits , key   components , and connections between components to consider when distinguishing torment focuses   and open doors for changes or arrangements . 

 Application 

 I begin the procedure by making a straw man realistic of the issue space . To build up the straw man   realistic , I will draw from any current material accessible to comprehend the earth . The current material   might be operational or procedural archives , preparing materials , showcasing materials , GAO or other   examining reports . In the event that materials are not accessible , then I direct casual meetings with one- three of the partners who serve as my principle purposes of contact on the activity . 

 On the off chance that proper to the circumstance , I will obtain the idea to "" front - stage / back - stage ""   from revious examine , and talked about in <NAME> <NAME> 's book , "" The Connected Company "" . The front- stage / back - stage approach strengthens the thought that each administration – even an inward   administration – has clients with whom the administration supplier collaborates and interior procedures   that empower the association to give the administration . The format I frequently begin with additionally   has a segment on the left to recognize Partners and Value Chain Providers and a segment on the   privilege to distinguish Oversight Organizations , for example , Congress , GAO , worker 's parties , support   bunches , and different substances that might add limitations to how the association works . The straw   man realistic is straightforward , utilizing basic shapes and symbols accessible in <NAME> or on the Internet .   On the off chance that the front - stage / back - stage view does n't work , then I will make an alternate sort   of visual , either taking into account an abnormal state process stream with swim paths for various   partners , or another configuration . 

 For the movement , I will partition the partners into gatherings of 5 - 6 members each speaking to an   alternate association or zone of hobby . Every gathering gets a notice size duplicate of the straw man   realistic that they can compose on straightforwardly , or use sticky notes to make remarks . I give them   two - three inquiries to reply , for example , 

    What key components are absent from the realistic ? 

     What might you change about the realistic to make it all the more precisely mirror your issue   space ? 

     What key bits of knowledge do you have about the connections between the elements in your   issue space ? 

 I give them around 20 minutes to talk about the inquiries and imprint up the realistic . At that point I   have every gathering report out on their responses to those three inquiries while indicating the imprint   ups on their publication . As every gathering reports out , I record shared traits in the bits of knowledge of   every gathering , and afterward extra experiences that originate from the gathering examination on an   extra duplicate of the realistic . After the session , I digitize every gathering 's notice as an ancient rarity ,   make a perspective that consolidates the mutual and new experiences from the gathering exchange ,   and afterward make a reconsidered realistic that fuses their criticism and proposed changes that they   consented to as a gathering . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have gained from leading this activity with a few gatherings is that while the realistic particularly   the modified realistic that fuses their criticism – is vital for strengthening their comprehension of the   issue they are attempting to tackle , the more significant part of the movement is the mutual bits of   knowledge and shared discovering that happens while they are attempting to characterize their issue   space . The realistic gives the assorted gathering of partners a point of convergence for dialog that   permits them to share their viewpoints and form bits of knowledge into potential underlying drivers of   their issues . While they could make the realistic from a clear slate in a community oriented way ,   beginning with a straw man kicks off the discussion for them . They can rapidly recognize where they are   in the realistic – or on the off chance that they are missing – and can all the more rapidly increase new   bits of knowledge about connections between key elements as opposed to requiring some serious   energy to distinguish them . They can likewise distinguish variables in the issue space – that is , it helps   them to recognize what they do n't have a clue , in what ranges they have to get data or information to   give the qualities to the variables . 

 I found that the most important angle is the mutual experiences and learning , next time I would utilize   the perception action as a beginning stage for a progression of outline intuition exercises . At that point   the changed realistic that joins their consolidated input can serve as a source of perspective instrument   all through the rest of their work .

"It was a fine Saturday morning where I was minding my   own business , doing my thing with nothing else   bothering me it was then it hit me that I was putting   something important for later . My bakeshop planning . I   realised this baking talent in me a few years ago , a   talent which I tried improving after my 12th boards by   going to an 8 - day baking crash course which equipped   me with almost everything I needed to know about   baking . There ’s still room for me to improve but after   baking and decorating several cakes I knew I had to   make this a thing , after receiving several reviews in my   favour . My bakeshop planning becomes a challenge as I   must improve my talent in ways which would make   people happy to travel the distance to have a taste of my   cakes whilst the interiors being their mind ’s peace with a   piece of delicious cake . 

 The best tool I think would help realise my goal is the   visualisation tool . This tool would help materialise the   goal I have in my mind . A bakeshop in the streets of the   beautiful town in <ADDRESS> . Visualisation is any   technique of creating images , diagrams , or animations   to communicate a message . Visualization through visual   imagery has been an effective way to communicate both   abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity .   This tool is said to be used by many successful   entrepreneurs and businessmen around the world . 

 If there is anything in this world that we want ,   visualisation is the best way it makes it come true . Have   it in your mind positively , the universe conspires to bring   it to you in a way better than you had imagined . Use all 

 the possible ways to picturise your mind voice by way of   pictures graph , diagrams etc and make your dream   come true .

"Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I work in insurance industry . Insurance is a complex product and I often found myself   struggling to explain the benefits of it to a prospect . As the product has a lot of clauses and   legal terms customer has to put in a lot of cognitive power to understand . And the other   problem was that customer misunderstood the terms in the insurance . 

 Selection 

 Human beings are only animals which can process an abstract and believe in it . Stories has   been a powerful medium to explain complex concepts like god , honesty etc . I chose to use   stories to explain benefits of Insurance . 

 Application 

 I created small stories around the different benefits of Insurance . I use one of it when and   where required . For example , the survival benefit in life insurance will have small story . The   story would have a one or two characters and I use some relatable everyday terms to   explain the survival benefits . I even include humour at certain places , I found that this helps   in keeping the listener interested in the story 

 <NAME> 

 The stories were very effective in not only in communicating the benefits but also retention   of the knowledge . My customers trust with the product and me increased several folds . 

 Approach 

 The next time I use the stories of real incidents . I feel it will increase the authenticity of the   story and would result in better customer satisfaction .

 This remains indded one of the greatest challenges that I   accomplished during my inital struggling days . This was also   problematc since it was a complex problem � ie it was a blend of   multple simpler problms . ttll <NAME> is a problem � so in order to   solve this � I used this approach of solving . 

 I ofen used this techniuue with all my stakeholders � all I did was   dividing my task into several smaller units � and assigning each of my   stakeholder group a task to perform . This way I had planned the   executon of my work . Now the next hurdle that comes to my way is   selecton od uuite efcient team to execute my vision . . I have used   thetechniuue of using a project mnegement and negotaton of a   problem domain with a set of uuestons or discussion to allow a   diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defning the scope � boundaries � key elements � and relatonships   between elements to consider when identfying pain points and   opportunites for improvements or solutons 

 <NAME> 

 The applicaton of the skills   For the actvity � I will divide the   stakeholders into groups of some partcipants ranging from 5 to 10   partcipants each representng a different organizaton or area of   interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the car design   using various platorms like CAD / CAM / fusion 360 / solidworks . That   they can write on directly � or use stcky notes to make comments . I   give them two - three uuestons to answer � such as : 1 ) What key   elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change   about the graphic to make it more accurately refect your problem   space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about the relatonships   between the enttes in your problem space ? I give them 

 approximately 60 minutes to discuss the uuestons and mark up the   graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to   those three uuestons while pointng to the mark - ups on their   poster . As each group reports out � I record commonalites in the   insights of each group � and then additonal insights that come from   the group discussion on an additonal copy of the graphic . Afer the   session � I digitze each group ’s poster as an artfact � create a view   that combines the shared and new insights from the group   discussion � and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their   feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group .   tpace . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal   point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectves and   develop insights into potental root causes of their problems . While   they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaboratve   manner � startng with a CAD device / modelling devics starts the   conversaton for them . They can uuickly identfy where they are in   the graphic – or if they are missing – and can more uuickly gain new   insights about relatonships between key enttes instead of taking   tme to identfy them . They can also identfy variables in the problem space – that is � it helps them to identfy what they do n’t know � in   what areas they need to obtain informaton or data to provide the   values for the variables . Hence with this approach we can fgure out   various applicatons / implementatons 

 Insight and approach : 

 Debt is a viable option . Debt is scary to take on , especially when   your idea is n't a sure bet , but almost everyone on this list got a loan at   some point to establish early momentum . As long as you have a plan   to pay it back , debt can be a valuable tool . 

 Invest in yourself . You need to invest in yourself before you invest in anything else , by focusing on improving your skills , education and   experience . Without self - investment , you wo n't be able to build a   business , let alone sustain one . 

 Look to the future . These savvy entrepreneurs did n't enter a market   that already existed ; they created new ones , or made bets on how   current markets would evolve . Future - focused strategies always win   out over present - focused ones .Entrepreneurs can come from humble   beginnings , so long as they 're willing to work hard , commit to their   ideas and take the risks necessary to see those ideas become reality .   Take inspirations , and do n't let a lack of money or experience   dissuade you from following your dreams .

"Visualization Tool 

 Challenge & Selection : As a graphic designer I use visualization tool very often to communicate my ideas   to stockholders and get their minds into what I am thinking about and to make sure   they receive the full picture of the design idea . 

 In addition , I use this tool to get customer feedback on the design and how they   would like it to be in order to develop it in a way that is more suitable for their   needs . I use it usually in the beginning of the design process in order to gather   information and understand what customers need . 

 Application : If I am meeting in person with the client , I start by asking questions to help   formulate the initial ideas about what they need and then start reﬁning their   answers on a white board using simple sketches and diagram to help illustrate their   visions of the design they want in front of them . After that , I start adding my   suggestions on how to make the design more attractive and at the same time   deliver it message ; whether it was an event poster , an advertisement on a web   page , or an infographic . 

 After creating the design I print it and hang it on the board and presented it to the   client to check if there are any areas of improvements , sketching all their   comments directly on it to see how it can become . 

 Insight Visualization is very effective in creating a ﬁrst draft of the design that have mostly   all the information that the customer needs and share feedback in the same   moment from both sides ( mine and client ) through the conversation that takes place   in the visualising and brainstorm phase from both sides on the white board which   helps in ﬁnding a common ground and an efﬁcient design . 

 Approach   Since this tool is very effective for my work , in future I will replace the traditional   white board with a smart one . In order to allow more ﬂexibility in the sketches as   well as offering a verity of options such adding pictures , icons , colours and saving   the sketches to go back to it when needed . 

"
"Challenge and selection 

 The first tool used is visualization because it is easy to understand the problem and   stakeholders will not be assuming a triangle when I ’m explaining them the square   which will be useful in providing solution . 

 I have used a straw man graphic which will help the stakeholders to give necessary   suggestions based on the straw man graphic and it will help us to find out the   opportunities and solutions for the improvement of the process . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To   develop the video , I ’ll be using the material available to understand the   environment .      For more information is needed then informal interviews can be taken with one or   three of the stakeholders who will be serving as my main points of contact on the   initiative .     For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each   representing a different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a   poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly , or use   sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , such   as : 

 1 .   What key elements are missing from the graphic ?    2 . What would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect 

 your problem space ? 

 3 . What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities 

 in your problem space ? 

 I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the   graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three   questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports   out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional   insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic .   After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that   combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a   revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they   agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while   the graphic – especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is   important for reinforcing their understanding of the problem they are working to   solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights and shared   learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem space . The   graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that   allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root   causes of their problems .      While they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner ,   starting with a straw man jump starts the conversation for them . They can quickly   identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are missing – and can more   quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of taking   time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that   is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain   information or data to provide the values for the variables .      Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning ,   next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of   design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their   combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their   work .

"<NAME> <NAME> – Final Assignment – design thinking @ coursera 

 Visualization Tool – Reflection on Beauty 

 Pattern 

 Problem Statement : The Challenge   In a daily basis , society is bombarded with media information that dictates beauty patterns . Constantly ,   men and women of all ages are being told what is the accepted human pattern that they must belong ,   suffering from the consequences of trying to fit into this beauty pattern . For example , the long - term   effects once a teenager girl starts to pursue the intangible beauty are widely known and reflect on   increased rates of eating disorders just to cite one consequence . In contrast , older women are being   heavily attracted to the pursue of the anti - aging era through more aggressive treatments ( surgical and   non - surgical treatments ) . However , in this reflection , the hypothesis is that the pursue of beauty may be   endless and more than often , it does not bring happiness to those individuals . We all have seen   celebrities whose faces seem disfigured due to the high quantity of cosmetic procedures , but they keep   going on more . Such globally known examples are <NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> <NAME> , and Rodrigo   Alves , the Human <NAME> doll . 

 In this reflection , it is also accepted the lasting benefits of skincare routines coupled with good lifestyle   choices . In another words , the usage of good quality cosmetics brands in a daily skincare routine by itself   does only half of the job of keeping a healthy look . It is extremely important that the lifestyle of choice   matches the common goal . However , most people expect that the cosmetic products generate not only   an amazing effect on their looks , but also a result that shows quickly . 

 The main challenge is to effectively encourage a lifestyle change that connects the individual to their   inner beauty and core values , but also provides information to feed into the self - care of their bodies and   deal with aging of their bodies and face , by using social media and/or online tools such as Facebook ,   Instagram , Tik - Tok and other widely known networking platforms . 

 The Tool   For this challenge , I have chosen the Visualization Tool since it provides a blank canvas for the user to   dwell on many aspects they desire and at the same time , focusing on the current topic ( the challenge ) .   The objective is to capture any information that flows naturally and with no direction from me – the   facilitator ( no guidance will be provided , except by a few information ) on how the user would expect to   connect the most important areas of facial beauty to their inner happiness , and how they expect to   achieve it . As <NAME> <NAME> stated in her video , Visualization is a way [ that people ] communicate in a   non - logical manner , and by using this tool , I expect to find categories of people and patterns of   problems , and finally , to be able to discover how people expect to deal with the body and facial aging . I   also expect to gain insight on the strategies that people may come up with in order to deal with the   aging process . Most importantly , as Myers highlights during her speech , the Visualization tool has a   major goal to understand the users in a passive manner , and this comes in direct alignment with the   Design Thinking practices . 

 <NAME> <NAME> – Final Assignment – design thinking @ coursera 

 Application    The user received two pages ( on an A4 size paper ) with a large face draw on it . The first face represents   their face now , and the second face represents their face at a future state ( about 20 years into the   future ) . Both drawings of faces have no hair and are generalized simple faces with just the contour of   the head , lips , nose , eyes and eyebrows . The user was asked to draw / collage / paint / write the parts of   the face that brings happiness now . The second face the user was asked to draw / paint / collage / write   how they imagine their looks after all this time ( 20 years ) . 

 Once in possession of the results , I hold several 10 - 15 min interview with each user , individually , to ask   about their drawings . At this time of the interview , the question is “ how are you planning to accept the   changes that you draw in your face ? ” . After collection of this information , all responses were   categorized in groups , patterns and insights were identified . 

 The categories of groups are divided by age , ethnicity , region ( to capture the influence of weather   conditions ) and social status . Additionally , I was able to analyze the results based on easily identifiable   concerns for example , if the lips are the most mentioned problem area in terms of happiness and which   groups consider that feature the most important . My major interest was to identify which strategies   users are planning to deal with the aging process . 

 Insights Gained & Approach   From this exercise , I learned that most people do n’t have a defined strategy on how to deal with the   aging process and most of the responses indicate that this is an area of concern that we are not   prepared to deal with . While some responses mentioned that they consider performing plastic surgery   in the future , there was a consensus on how the surgeries are the last resort and users prefer a gradual   skincare routine to prevent major issues in the future . 

 Some answers included the healthcare aspect ( for instance , skin cancer is a concern specially in the   Northern regions , in contrast with South American responses ) . But also , mental health was mentioned in   many answers stating that the aging process may cause depression in some , so definitely it is of public   interest to take preventative measures to prepare individuals for the future , in terms of skin and body   care . 

 The process in which the Visualization tool was applied seemed to be satisfactory not only because it   allowed each user to express themselves more freely , but it allows the user to not be tied to directions ,   and therefore , the responses were of a varying degree of details and very different from each other . The   Visualization tool , as applied in this exercise , benefited on the post - interview . The rationale behind it is   that each user was able to express themselves in their unique way , and I needed some degree of   quantifiable information in order to categorize the responses . Therefore , when using this type of tool , I   recommend the interview or a table - format follow up in order to gather key points , otherwise the   exercise becomes very subjective .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of the “ Design Management ” department in a retail - based 

 organization . My job scope often requires me to embark on innovative taskforces to 

 propose new retail ideas and architectural innovations ahead of current retail trends . 

 My recent challenge was to propose unique landscape concepts and ideas that can 

 be incorporated architecturally to create revolutionary state - of - the - art retail spaces , 

 to bring greater values to my organization ’s future retail malls . 

 Selection 

 For kick - start , I focused on extensive research on publications and the internet , 

 focusing on traditional landscape design theories , latest landscape technologies , 

 highly dependent on information available on public platforms . As a result , my initial 

 proposals was very limited in content and deemed as too idealistic and unrealistic , 

 impossible to implement and unsustainable , particularly criticized and challenged by 

 my organization ’s property management team . Upon reflecting , I realized that my 

 failure stems from that my proposal was shallow , merely touching upon landscape 

 design aesthetics , without true understanding for the process of growing and 

 maintaining plants , and inconsiderate to users ’ needs . I recognized that I will need 

 immersive exploration of the landscape field in order to successfully redefine my 

 “ What is ? ” , reveal realistic problems and unarticulated insights to uncover underlying 

 opportunities and possibilities . My approach was to utilize “ Story - telling ” to help to 

 empathize with true user experience as a means to curate unconventional retail 

 ideas . 

 Application 

 I interviewed my organization ’s property management team to understand their 

 realistic daily operational difficulties in maintaining landscapes in our malls and 

 learnt from their iterations of common mistakes made by landscape designers . For 

 example , more than often , landscape designs are utopias as designers has minimal 

 understanding for their proposed choice of plant species , which often turns out to be 

 unsuitable for growth in the local climate and conditions etc . In particular , they 

 identified that their greatest challenge was maintaining green walls in indoor malls 

 and ensuring that the green walls continue to attain their designed aesthetic outlook , 

 and often at an expensive maintenance cost . Subsequently , upon establishing a 

 rapport with the property management team , they invited me on overseas guided 

 visits to landscape - themed parks and research laboratories by landscape experts and 

 meetings with green wall suppliers whom they have acquaintance with . The resultant 

 proposal is a green wall collaboration with the suppliers we have met . It was an 

 unanticipated success : achieving a win - win situation for all the 3 parties . For our 

 property management team , the green walls ’ maintenance cost were greatly 

 reduced with their maintenance work taken over by the suppliers , who in return 

 showcased their products in our mall for advertisements . Also , I was able to ensure 

 that my avant - garde landscape ideas can be implemented and sustainably 

 maintained with expertise assistance , at a reasonable cost . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Through adopting the “ Storytelling tool ” , not only was I able to gain in - depth 

 understanding and journey - map the property management team ’s job to establish 

 valuable design opportunities through empathizing with their daily job challenges . I 

 was able to establish a rapport with the property management team through our 

 interview conversations and interactions , thus successfully inviting their contribution 

 and engaging them in design and co - creation of my proposal , which definitely has 

 significant impact on its success . This experience has therefore allowed me fully 

 comprehend the power of “ Storytelling ” and the limitless potentials that it 

 empowers .

"Design Thinking for Innovation 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Gitam University 

 December ,   2021 

 Challenge 

 My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without 

 sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant , and can not 

 cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months . 

 The company is in a dilemma , as it has two potential investors ; The first 

 investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the 

 plant , in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain 

 changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has 

 shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50 % 

 in the company , the second investor offers the capital necessary for the 

 creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the 

 final product , since this is the one that is generating the exponential 

 growth of the company , for the moment it is only asked to focus on the 

 company 's success product and as they recover the investment they can 

 be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20 % stake 

 within the company . 

 As a manager of the company , I need to make the best decision for the 

 above mentioned one . 

 Selection 

 I decided to choose the visualization tool , visualization allows me to 

 understand and analyze the context , to be able to define the needs and 

 their possible solutions . This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision 

 of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires ; 

 through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors , such 

 as <NAME> and <NAME> ; and based on this I can make the best decision . 

 Application 

 In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set 

 myself , the tool has been of a very wide utility , since when applying it to 

 my challenge very good results were obtained , since with this I could have 

 an analysis to the measure of the two investors . The first thing I did with 

 my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required 

 the flagship product of the company , first I had to understand why the 

 demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months , by applying 

 the tool I could find the answers to this question ; I could see that 

 customers needed this product as it was , without any modification 

 because the product worked wonders . 

 With this study of the clients interested in the product , I was able to 

 analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two 

 investors . 

 I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first 

 instance to supply the product that was having great success . Which was 

 the second investor , since he was interested in first of all to give the size 

 of production that our customers demanded , and then worry about 

 improving it , but in small and concise steps . 

 I discarded the first investor , as he did not meet the requirements that the 

 company needed at that time . I realized that this investor was convinced 

 that by changing the product to the way he thought , the demand was 

 going to increase more ; but in reality what the company needed was to be 

 able to cover the demand that the product was having , this investor 

 wanted to throw everything we had , to the side of the road , but he did not 

 think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in 

 case things do not go as well as expected . 

 Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points 

 of the company 's needs and how each investor , according to their 

 proposals , could help me , based on this I made the best decision . I chose 

 to work with the second investor , we were able to supply the demand for 

 the product , then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into 

 research for product innovation , and make some small changes , which 

 were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities . 

 When customers became more interested in the improved product , we 

 decided to increase production by improving the product . 

 Perspective 

 The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we 

 obtained by using the visualization tool , the first thing is that we must 

 always think first about the needs of customers , of the people interested 

 in the product ; it is very useful to know what the problem is , what is the 

 cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution . Secondly , 

 based on what we have obtained , we can find a partner that fits our 

 needs , and be able to work as a team , unifying ideas and producing 

 possible solutions . Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design 

 course , I was able to create a strategic plan for the company 's problems 

 and make it a successful plan . 

 Approach 

 What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used , I 

 would like to use the learning launch ; I would do it in the following way , 

 rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that 

 the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the 

 required demand . It may or may not work out , but I would like to have 

 employed this strategy .

"Tuning Beam for Coursera - design Thinking for Innovation 

 When tuning beam on an ion implanter , it can be difficult to achieve the desired outcome .   There are   many inputs , many manipulations of the system , and several desired outputs .   Before an ion implanter is   signed off or accepted at a customer site , a technician must prove that the tool can perform as   promised .   To be more specific for our purposes only , the beam must reach a specific maximum current   and we will be investigating the beam shape as a possible cause of not reaching the maximum current . 

 The tool I wish to describe is Visualization .   There are already many cues from the software on the   operator interface , but understanding them and “ seeing ” what the beam is doing in your mind ’s eye can   really help when trying to get the tool to attain that maximum beam current .   The tool measures many   different things at different points in the beamline and interpreting these measurements can help the   technician pinpoint the weak link in the beam tuning . 

 The application of the visualization tool should work like this .   The technician can look at the final   beam measurements .   How close is the beam to the desired current ?   Assuming the beam injection   setup is close to a historically good beam , the technician must dig deeper .   What does the beam shape   look like ?   Is it too wide , too tall ?   Now the technician must visualize where in the beamline the beam is   tuned for the specific shape that is outside of normal operating conditions .   The technician can now   increase the voltage on the suspected tuning optic and check the beam shape again .   Did the beam   shape change ?   In the desired direction ?   The technician can use these visualization techniques to tune   specific parts of the beam with much more certainty than guessing and checking . 

 The insight the technician can gain from implementing the visualization tool is more confidence as the   beams are tuned with more ease and at much faster paces .   The technician will be able to independently   check their assumptions and develop a firmer understanding of what the beam may look like and what   kind of adjustments will affect it and to what degree . 

 At this point , we want to weigh our options on using another approach from our toolbox .   Our clever   technician was already using the Learning Launch when trying to manipulate the beam after the   visualization exercise .   The technician was trying to pinpoint the most likely element to adjust while   visualizing the beam and then running an experiment to see if the adjustment worked or not . 

 If we had tried to use <NAME> <NAME> instead of Visualization , the technician could have had similar   results .   After identifying how the beam should be manipulated , the technician could have made a list or   diagram of the different things that can be adjusted .   From there , each adjustment could be categorized   by how it is supposed to affect the beam .   By categorizing each as position , angle , or size , the technician   could then pick from a shortened list to make the desired adjustments . 

 Determining which tools is more effective probably depends more on the personal experience of the   technician .   With a more advanced understanding of the tool , the technician can probably visualize it   better .   If visualization is difficult , <NAME> <NAME> is probably more fail safe , but more time consuming to   implement . 

"
"Storytelling 

 Challenge and selection : I worked on a research project where I accumulated a large amount of data and need to present it to   the business / stakeholders .   This part of the business struggles to attract more customers as the levels of satisfaction are low .   And the data from my research project highlights some of the reasons for   this , as well as suggests what can be changed to improve the proposition . 

 I believe that storytelling tool could help me present these findings to the team in a way that will be   relatable and provide a clear message .   It will allow me to deliver the large amount of data I ’ve   collected in a simple but also passionate way , so that the stakeholders get engaged and see the clear   message iand what changes are needed to happen .   By using the storytelling tool , I wo n’t just be   listing the findings and possible solutions , but I ’ll bring this connection between customers and the   business to the room , so that the stakeholders can clearly relate to the problems in the product . 

 Application : In my case , where I work with large amounts of data , it can be tricky to get a short and concise   presentation .   But by using the storytelling tool , I can summarise the data so that it ’s clear and   does n’t require me to share all the small details .   Besides large numbers of quantitative data , I also   have some comments from the customers about what they like and do n’t like about the product .   So   to bring my story to life and make it more engaging , I ’ll start with a story from a customer .   I can   picture an average customer who is less happy with the service , read a comment from them as well   as tell what exactly goes wrong for them ( website is confusing , or could n’t complete an order ) . 

 By talking also to some stakeholders prior to the final presentation , I can gather information on the   business side of the situation and add to my story some steps that business has been applying to try   and solve this problem .   However , as I ’ve discovered , some areas are not being covered by the   current strategy and they seem to be key to customers .   So , by bringing the customer ’s story to live   in my presentation , it ’ll make the team understand how to amend the current plan and start   introducing solutions that will really make the difference to the customers . 

 Insight and approach : This tool works great in my job where I have to work with large data sets and limited time that the   business has to listen to my findings .    By delivering key findings in a relatable , simple way of a   story , I could gain stakeholders ’ attention as well as deliver key messages without overloading them with details .   This method causes great discussions in the room with people trying the situations on   to themselves and coming up with possible solutions to the problem . 

 I still use visuals when I use storytelling technique to make sure that everyone follows . And in some cases I add a little more detail to the story as I am aware that some stakeholders are much more   detail oriented than the others .   I ’ve had a situation where by just telling a concise story I then   would get questions around the proof for one or the other statement .   So usually , I ’d either have a   handout / appendix with more details , or add some numbers to the main story if appropriate for the   audience .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I am currently pursuing bachelor in electrical engineering in <ADDRESS> it is basically four year course and I am   currently in third year . So I am basically focusing on challenges in Indian Education System . I know this   system might have worked for many people and many of them are pioneers in their respective field but   situation has changed drastically from past few decades and we are still following the same old techniques   of teaching . I have tried to reach out to as many students as I can in this situation of pandemic outbreak   via social media , Google forms etc . most of these are college students and these are few challenges I can   list down from those online surveys 

 1 . College world and corporate or practical world are completely different .   2 . Syllabus taught in most of the colleges is outdated .   3 . Teaching pattern is same up to graduation level .   4 . Lack of motivation in teacher due to lack of funding .   5 . Huge population of <ADDRESS> . 

 Selection 

 In week 2 session <NAME> <NAME> said that storytelling is not the list of things we have to do it 's about the   connection that we give to people about piece of information we want to share and I think it is very true .   In hugely populated country like <ADDRESS> I think a nice story can bring many positive changes . 

 Application 

 Well you have to start every positive change from yourself . I thought in this pandemic lockdown how can   we still continue our learning and also how can we minimize effects of the challenges . Answer was quite   simple our class decided that everything from lectures to assignment will go online many of you might   think what ’s the big deal in it but where I came from many of my classmates are from rural areas and   having good internet connection is still a challenge in those area . Now many of our alumni association   members have raised issue of college students are not compatible to work in corporate world so as to   reduce this gap college and corporate world our college has started various initiatives such as online   seminars and free online courses on many platform such as coorsera because of my college ’s initiative I   am able to do this course which has taught me a lot about design thinking . Now I have enrolled to some   technical courses(for free of cost ) which has a lot of practical approach of teaching and I am having fun   over learning there too and also the teachers are very determined to teach us so that also motivates me to   perform well . In this pandemic lockdown I am trying to build myself capable of facing post pandemic   challenges by educating self and our government is also funding this kinds of projects , right now in <ADDRESS>   we have many bigger problems rather than education itself but I think learning should not be stopped at   any point . 

 Insight 

 Storytelling works like charm for expressing your feelings and opinions on certain topics . I just realize   that I have expressed some of the thoughts from my mind that I stored subconsciously in mind . I think 

 there are millions of students who can relate to my story and I think this kinds of story can bring the new   era of learning and education . 

 Approach 

 I have realized some new challenges while writing this story such as internet connectivity in rural areas I   would like to express that topic more deeply next time and I think mind mapping technique can also be   used to understand these challenges more deeply so I am very excited to use all the tools I have gained   from this course . 

"
"Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I am an outreach volunteer in my organization who helps teaching poor young students who are   studying in government schools with no proper communication skills . I wanted to help the larger group   of students from 1st to 10th grade and the challenge was there is not enough volunteers to support and   teach them . 

 Selection 

 While I was going through the design thinking training , the Storytelling Tool had attracted me , and I got   a spark that people do things when they get inspired about what others do and how it impacts the   people . So , I believed that if I can convey the impact which we are doing to the society and people , there   will be more volunteers to support us . 

 Application 

 I organized a meeting in our work floor where <NAME> of people seated . I shared a story of a boy who born   poor with less option for studies , but with all difficulties he went up to the school which does not have   enough teachers to teach the students . He longed for knowledge and communication skills till last year .   Today , his total life is changed , he can communicate well in English with all the people and he passed   out his 10th grade in distinction . Now , it is his turn that he wanted to help others in the society . So , he is   volunteering 1 hour daily for the students of his school . Do you know , how the boy was able to be   successful ? Our organization has taken up the volunteering activity to teach the students in the school , it   was only 5 team members who made this difference to the boy and his life . Just think about we 100s of   people spending 1 hour to volunteer what is the difference we can make for society . It is our   responsibility to give what we got at our early age . It is our responsibility to develop our country . I finally   finished the story with a question on who wanted to Make a Difference to our society . 

 Insight 

 Well , the story has connected most of the people on the floor and we drastically seen the difference in   the volunteering numbers . People were sharing their experience of joy and gratitude when they teach   the students for free of cost . It also gives them peace of mind knowing that they are making a difference   to the society . 

 This clearly gave me an insight that how a little story can connect well with people and open up their   mind to try a different things in life that they have not thought about . We were trying out emails and   floor walks to ask for volunteers earlier , but the result was not what we got now . The only difference we   tried was to include a story in it to tell the message to people . It made a difference to the result . 

 Approach 

 I will continue to use the same tool for this challenge as it has given an impact drastically . I will try to   improvise the story along with videos of the schools and students to make it more efficient .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Quick background . I own a small clothing company with my partner and the Kenyan business environment ,   has n’t been too kind . 

 Keeping the lights on aside , growing the business and scaling production have been an obstacle for a young   cash - strapped small enterprise . We had to find a better approach where we could confirm and disconfirm   assumptions to adapt our ideas into feasible products and we had to do it fast and cheap .. 

 Insight & Approach 

 Second hand clothes in <ADDRESS> are a KES.56 billion shilling a year business and this has dealt a big blow to   the textile indstry .   In light of the economic downturn this past few years , our brand customers who are   discerning are always looking to find unique apparel deals ; be it mtumba ( thrift stores ) , imports or acquiring   locally tailored clothes which are more affordable and widely - found . We chose the Learning Launch tool to   find a put together a well thought through go - to market strategy that could give us good return on   investment and grow the brand . 

 We asked ourselves what would be the best way to test out our ideas and be able to mitigate the risk of   losing money on failing products ; we then landed on testing as our tool . 

 Application 

 That said , we looked to find ways to work around our assumptions and confirmation bias and key among   them has been working tirelessly with the help of tools such as design briefs and design criteria to help us   visualise and pivot . 

 Looking at the process objectively and as an excerise of prudence , we looked to run a small experiment in   the real marketplace where we coud reduce the risk of any growth initiative by engaging our biggest   stakeholder - the customer . 

 By testing some of the prototypes from our capsule collection with our clientele through co - creation , we   found it easier to get meaningful feedback and with our design brief as the compass , we could move to   innovate . We handpicked a number of influential personalities who we felt embodied the spirit of the brand   and would also fit the bill in terms of our key audience . 

 Interestingly enough , it worked and they were quick to point out fundamental flaws in our prototypes and   our marketing strategy . We kept on They proved invaluable and we went as far as letting them test out the   products at social events and parties , and this dipstick test pushed us further as we went back to the   drawing room , brainstormed and developed even better concepts . 

 We single - handedly created a project management aid that   we utilise to this day and the shared   understanding that came from this potpourri helped us in rolling out one of our best selling collections . This   course has opened my eyes to new possibilities and even bigger opportunities . Now i can explore business   avenues that were once pipe dreams and help my business grow at the same time .

"<NAME> <NAME> // Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am founder and president of an art and culture association in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . Since its foundation , this association has   had the goal to engage foreign students and expats living in <ADDRESS> and the Italian society in a dialogue through cultural   events . For this purpose , we design and produce numerous cultural events ( mostly concerts ) during a year and this   requires a comprehensive knowledge of the audience . Initially , to understand better our market , we relied on   traditional market research methods . Thus , we sent out surveys to define our target audience ’s taste and preferences .   However , the results were not satisfying . Non - Italian respondents were interested in cultural events that would not   attract the Italian audience , therefore , they could not result in the desired interaction between these two   communities . 

 Moreover , we wanted our cultural events to be of high quality and have a positive impact on the cultural taste   of our   foreign community . Cultural events which precisely matched this community ’s taste could not result in their cultural   growth , and thus did not satisfy us as cultural activists . Our confusion and lack of experience resulted in a dramatic   failure of our first project . We organized a high - quality jazz event in one of the best music halls in the city . This event   cost us a lot of money and energy , but , unfortunately , our ticket sales were not even close to satisfying and the   expected interaction between foreigners and Italians , of course did not happen . Following this defeat , we decided to   take a different path and try a new approach . 

 Selection 

 After an extensive discussion in the association , we decided to try the Learning Launch or the experimentation   approach . We decided to follow the suggestion of <NAME> <NAME> that he made in his lecture : “ The key is to do experiments   that are fast and cheap ” . 

 Application 

 After convincing other members of the association , we decided to design a higher number of smaller and more   affordable projects which could be implemented more frequently . This allowed our learning - by - doing and to helped   us to improve our cultural events in process considering feedback from the audience and other stakeholders . Since   then , our cultural events were prototypes , designed and planned in collaboration with our audience , which was   enabled to express its opinions and discuss the event ’s content , schedule , timing , etc . on our social media platforms . 

 After each event , we conducted surveys in which we asked the audience ’s opinion on the event and their expectations   regarding our future activities . We also made in - depth interviews with those who had more to say . Moreover , we   tried to understand to which extent our events influenced our audience ’s taste and how much they facilitated their   interaction with the local society . This new approach proved to be highly efficient . In few months , we started to make   profits and were able to invest more in new projects . We also had less disagreements with our audience over taste   and had a better understanding of our events ’ identity and our brand . Furthermore , we had a more balanced   presence of Italian and non - Italian audience at our events . 

 Insight 

 After few successful experiments , we learned that planning and designing cultural events based solely on simplified   customer surveys results is a waste of time and energy . Products ( here cultural events ) have to be designed based on   a deep understanding of the market that can be gained through an anthropological study of the consumers .   Moreover , we can not expect a comprehensive market research to lead us to a single product which will perform   perfectly . An organization has to have a set of prototypes which are designed based on research and tested early in   the process , so that if not successful , they can fail fast and cheap . This model allows the organization to test , improve ,   and review the product on the iterative basis . Continuous experimentation allows not only to find the product that 

 matches the target market ’s expectations the best , but also triggers innovation . Users ’ feedback may lead to discovery   of new products and services . 

 Approach 

 In few months , our association is planning the first edition of an annual music festival . This festival ’s program and the   list of performing bands and musicians will be decided in a collaborative process between the potential audience and   the organizers . Though , a slightly bigger weight will be given to the organizers ’ choices , because we do not want the   festival ’s genre to be completely defined by the taste of the audience . However , design and organization of this   festival again relies upon the Learning Launch approach and Experimentation . Beside the main program of the festival ,   there will be a parallel event in which a variety of smaller concerts that are not precisely selected and curated will take   place .

"Example Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In my country , the law will soon come into force , which will severely restrict the development 

 of one of the key sales of our company . Around the law of very much information . one is 

 authentic , the other has only logical conclusions . At the same time , the sales channel at the 

 moment is quite developed and brings very good results . For the systematization of all 

 information , its visualization , for finding unobvious connections and finding interesting 

 solutions for support and further development of the sales channel , I decided to use Mind 

 Mapping 

 Application 

 To create the maps , I decided to use the on - line tool to build <NAME> maps – Coggle . I marked the 

 central theme and we began to write out all the facts and thoughts on this topic . I must say that 

 I originally made two maps . one developed a profile group . a group that was always engaged in 

 this sales channel or was deeply in this topic . With this group , we brought all the obvious facts 

 and added further visual displays . we did this already on a printed map by hand . each 

 supplemented the fact or information of another team member . so I wanted to make sure that 

 all members of the team understand about the same and visualize facts and information . To 

 minimize the subjective perception of facts and information . Another card was created by a 

 group that was never involved in sales . In this group for another look and interpretation of 

 known facts when creating <NAME> mapp I used the method described in magazine Harvard 

 Business Review Russia may 2018 by the host <NAME> <NAME> "" flurry of questions "" . For every 

 known fact\obstacle development of the sales channel this group generated a "" flurry of 

 questions . "" The result of these two cards were interesting ideas of the use of automata in the 

 genus instead of some sales outlets and a few very interesting ideas that require additional 

 development . 

 Insight 

 I realized that this tool will be one of the main tools for me to analyze , assimilate a large 

 number of inofomatsii different people , as well as a simple way to find the relationship 

 between the facts . 

 Approach 

 Next time I would mix up the groups , which this time were too crystalline . One was completely 

 in the subject matter , a friend is not at all in the subject . One used the usual approach when 

 creating ... , another slightly unusual , mixed approach with the simulacrum of brainstorming .

"REFLECTION - STORYTELLING 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I use Storytelling on my daily tasks as Admissions Office at a University . The people I work are young , and   unexperienced , so I must elaborate a quick overview of the career path they have chosen . Most of them   go to our meetings in company of their parents . I must have in mind that is not only a career that the   potential student is choosing , but an investment to the parents . Some of these students come from   disadvantaged families , so their admission is to a social scholarship . Often , these parents are most likely   to be open to the big achievements the potential student might achieve in the future . However , the   parents who do n’t apply to any economical benefit are more interested on the costs . 

 And there is the potential student who comes alone . He / she is older than the others , it ’s economically   independent and is looking forward to improving his / her opportunities in the market . I need to say that   these are my favorites , but also , the toughest . I like to think that my work is not to sell people education ,   but to open their eyes to all opportunities they will have once they complete the educational career . So ,   the independent young person , is the toughest not because of the cost ( most of them apply to a   scholarship ) but due their willingness to start such big project in time . 

 So , I started trying to learn about the potential students and their families to know better how the careers   they chosen might have a positive impact in all their lives . I start listening to the way the talk about things ,   where they focus the most ( is it the money ? The time ? Their needs ? ) , and I gather all the information to   try to solve their doubts with a story . 

 Application 

 As I said before , the independent young person who wants to start a University <NAME> is my favorite   person to have an admission meeting with , but also the toughest . I know so because I was that person   once . So , for me , the storytelling comes easy with those persons . 

 Once was this young man , around 22 years old , that his entire life wanted to become an accountant , as   his father was . His family had a truck company which moved goods all around the country and   internationally . He was so proud when he told me about his father truck , the first of the company , the   one in which he learned how to drive trucks . Unfortunately , his dad suffered a severe home accident and   was unable to keep working and died a few months later . This incident really affected the young man . He   was 16 when his dad died and took over some of the chores of the company while some of the uncles and   his mom took over the company . When he became 18 , he was controlling most of the actions on the   company but refused the opportunity to go to school and become an accountant as he always wanted .   Years passed , he was about to get married , and there he was , on my office because his fiancée told him   to pursuit his dreams . 

 I spent almost half of our meeting time just listening to his story , but worth it . He feared losing sight of   what really matters ( his dad company ) if he enrolled in a University Degree . But he knew his fiancée was   right , I mean , he was in an Admissions Office .   I told him my story , how I was scared from moving from   one corner of the country to another just to get my degree . I told him how I got here with little money   and a heart full of fear and hope . I told him of my first years of working , studying and learning to be an   independent adult all at the same time and how I had to make a lot of previous steps to get to my goal :   get a University Degree . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 I think he was not prepared to have that kind of talk on an admission meeting . He told me he was certain   that the meeting would proof nothing , and only dusty papers would remain as reminder of the meeting .   He ended up applying later that same day . 

 I shared this story with one of my colleagues and he shared back other stories alike . We talked about how   people are making a big decision coming to us and most of them can open once they have the chance . To   tell them that there are people that wore their shoes is really soothing for them . We ended up asked the   university to have more <NAME> <NAME> related trainings instead of Sales trainings . The university accepted   this and now trainings like these are mandatory .

"Example Reflection - Learning launch 

 Challenge :   This is one of the challenges I faced during my work as an associate professor teaching   mobile development to engineering students : We decided to adopt a Project Based Learning *   approach for the next year . A selection of professors in each department was deciding the way   to achieve this goal . The challenge was to make the classic software development courses   more meaningful and engaging to students and mentors .      Previous state : teaching classical mobile development courses with the same goals / objectives     Next state : Project Based Learning approach as an engaging experience during which each   student make his own mobile app .     Selection :     Our team is using some design thinking activities and tools during our courses ( story - telling   to explain a concept , mind mapping to introduce a complex module .. etc . )    We decided to use Learning launch tool since the challenge we ’re facing contains many   variables through time ( motivating students , motivating professors , changing the   curriculum , changing the way to grade students … etc . ) . The <NAME> launch is a tool that   implies to inspect and evaluate each assumption / initiative ( in our case each idea and change   we will make to the curriculum ) . Each initiative is reviewed to understand the generated   value which will be the key factor to keep or abandon that initiative .      Application :     First learning launch :      The first decisions concerned the courses structure : 

 -   Assumption = > Making decent projects must be preceded by knowledge transfer .   Decision = > During the first half of the semester , students learn the basics of mobile   development ,   then they have to develop their mobile app prototype in order to make a   final presentation with a ready to publish mobile application . Every student has 2   grades : presence during the courses and capstone project . 

 -   Assumption = > Including professors in the projects raises their motivation therefore   the quality of their effort .   Decision = > The description and theme of all apps were chosen by professors . 

 As we inspected the assumptions and decisions made through the first semester , we 

 decided to plan a second learning launch according to anonymous feedback we gathered from   students and professors participating in these projects .         Second learning launch     The decisions focused on enhancing the values generated from the previous learning launch : 

 -   Assumption = > Making decent projects must be preceded by knowledge transfer .   Decision = > Each course is divided into two parts : a guided workshop made by the 

 professor , then a hands - on workshop during which the student apply the concepts   learn to his own project . This way , the semester is a continuous and incremental   process . Every student has 2 grades : active presence through submitting each   workshop and capstone project ( this time submitted to the store since the essential   pillars of the app is developed through the semester ) . 

 -   Assumption = > Including professors in the projects raises their motivation therefore   the quality of their effort .   Decision = > The description and theme of all apps were chosen by professors and the 

 students have the right to suggest 3 ideas . Then the student has convince a jury of 3   professors of his idea in a scenario like talent reality shows . If the student gets the   approval of the majority , he will develop his idea , otherwise , he will get a project chosen   by the professors . 

 Insight :     Through learning launch , I learned to identify and prioritize assumptions then how to 

 inspect and develop each assumption taking into consideration feedback and gained value .   Personally it was interesting for me to get anonymous feedback about decisions that the   team had different opinions about . Then , build on this feedback and correct / enhance the   assumptions and decisions . Example : in the first learning   launch , we expected that the   students will be productive after finishing learning all the basics of mobile development .   In the contrary , we did n’t have a positive feedback on the first part . Students and   professors preferred to apply directly every concept learned in the capstone project . This   was an important issue that we did n’t anticipate ! 

 When we took this feedback into consideration we discovered that we can have some 

 time left before the module end ( between 1 and two weeks ) . And therefore , we were able   to make publishing the capstone project to the mobile store ( Android / iOS ) mandatory . 

 We decided that decisions affecting courses must be taken in association with the 

 continuous suggestions and feedback from our current and alumni students . 

 Approach :     Since the team is familiar with design thinking , and that the challenge is complex with 

 many variables to consider , I think that learning launch is the perfect tool to use . The   specter of use though could be enlarged to cover other topics / courses . The same design   thinking tool could be used with management , marketing and entrepreneurship   courses   that students are having simultaneously with our mobile development module : the   published mobile application could be a starting point to introduce marketing and   branding for example ! and this will join our team efforts to other professors teams in   addition to reshape the student experience into a continuous meaningful and unique   experience .

"Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge When I was in college , I was part of a consulting group which focuses on supporting NGOs . I was assigned to the group of 4 people which   consults an NGO that helps African mixed kids . This NGO holds community events each weekend for kids and parents with African roots and about 15 families engage each week . Events are always successful , they have fun but the NGO itself has serious financial problems and the NGO leader was willing to collect more donations to continue the activity . So my challenge was to solve how to raise more funds for this NGO . 

 Selection We selected a “ Mind Mapping ” tool to find the main cause of the problem and it was really effective to build up hypotheses on how to solve them . Before adopting a mind mapping tool , we conducted some interviews and collected data . We had some meetings with the leader and a financial executive , kids and parents who are involved in this activity , and   donors . We had so much information communicating with them , so the next step was to think about which information we should focus on . Mind mapping is a tool for finding coherent stories of hypotheses so it was a good tool for us after all these interviews and did n’t know what to focus on . 

 Application We lay out all the insights from the interviews on a mind mapping tool called “ mindmeister , ” which we can share and make a mind map online together .   First we made clusters with each personas , and wrote down what they said about the donor system . Second we collected the common elements of information and asked ourselves “ why this happens . ” By doing so , we could find out that although there are many fans of this NGO , like those who register on the mailing list , few people donate . Donations were done by very few people like professors and specialists but not by “ light fans . ” This conclusion united the group because the goal became clear , so in that sense , mind mapping was very effective . 

 Insight and Approach I found out that mind mapping is a strong tool for gathering , sharing your team ’s assumptions and creating a common goal . And is effective before generating ideas about how to solve them . I ’d like to use it the   next time between ‘ what is ’ and ‘ what if ’ phase , and also to use different tools when it comes to ‘ what if ’ phase . In the ‘ what if ’ phase , after using a mind mapping tool , we moved on to thinking how to improve the PRs . At that time we focused on how to make attractive potential HP and SNS they were using but I regret that we just focused on the media which this NGO already had . I did n't know the design thinking at that time and creative idea generation was lacking . Now after the course , I 'd like to focus more on how to be more creative when thinking about the solution , because the hypothesis story was clear after the mind mapping and unless this goal is clear , we could be more creative , for example using “ brainstorming '' . But overall , taking this course was a very good opportunity for reflecting on my project and my way of   problem - solving thinking , thank you ! 

"
"MIND MAPPING 

 According to me “ Mind Mapping ” , the tool selected by me , is   the approach of putting down the requirements and every   thing in our thoughts with respect to a problem in a   demystified manner in a compact way . After being in the   engineering background , economics was something that was   really tough for me to learn initially . Later , I got myself into   using the mind mapping techniques after each of the theory   sessions . Now I am clearly able to distinguish between what I   had learnt and what is remaining to learn . With the help of   mind mapping , I could learn a lot in a lesser time span and I   am sure that mind mapping will further help me to dig deeper   and gain more insights from the area of my studies and further   help me in solving people ’s problems .

"DESIGN OF A SOCIAL 

 ENTREPRENEURSHIP :   REFLECTION 

 CHALLENGE : 

 The challenge is to implement a social entrepreneurship that offers better job   opportunities . Activities to increase people 's interest in contributing more to an   undertaking of this kind . Spending on unsustainable products and inadequate   campaign marketing budgets are a problem . The project is limited in resources , that   is , budget and employee time . Social entrepreneurship is basically a non - profit   business that seeks to provide a solution to a community problem . We will focus on   trying to discover what the members of a social enterprise have as their objective .     SELECTION :   We have gone various activities such as the search for social value and its   sustainable development goals . Design thinking tools , so we 're ready to try the   learning launch tool . Generally speaking , the learning launch is an experiment   intended to quickly test an idea and a prototype . A prototype in a social enterprise   is to find 1 Mission , 2Vision , 3Impact .     APPLICATION :   For our first learning launch , we focused on the structure of company B. In particular ,   we wanted to see if we could implement more than three sustainable development   goals , projects , and processes to adapt project management methods .   We have as an example the Ballon company that uses 5 sustainable development   objectives :   1 . End of poverty   2 . Quality education   3 . Gender equality   4 . Reduction of inequalities   5 . Sustainable cities and communities     This is why for the design of a sustainable business model in a "" company b "" our work   challenge is reflected in the implementation of these objectives . We carry out   research and training to better understand the subject . Then , courses about what a   social entrepreneurship is , to structure our tasks and processes in a more agile way .   These two sessions occurred within 4 weeks . We hoped to produce a document with   a clear description of our new developments . 

 For our second learning release , we focused on gaining clarity about our exploration   techniques . This tested our assumption that our prioritization of techniques is in   observation , but we realized that it was the root cause of our challenge of creating a   social enterprise . Our team completed an anonymous survey . In addition , to help us   with the Guided Visit technique , a tool learned in the entrepreneurship course ; The   surveys included questions about the problem definition , potential beneficiaries , and   feelings about the change , and were conducted within 5 days . 

 INSIGHT :   By applying the learning release tool , we identified our assumptions and designed   releases to test these assumptions about how to suggest being a nonprofit . In   addition , we think about the anticipated results , hoping to find that a more   streamlined approach would improve the way we view specialized consumer   companies , and that both our team and key stakeholders would be quite open to   the new way of investing in a good . Social . Our actual results were slightly   different from what we anticipated : While we were open to prioritizing business   modeling in a social enterprise , key sustainability stakeholders had questions   about capital for company design , among others . In the future , we hope to   improve and design a prototype with all the key parts .     APPROACH :   Since we 've been through various design thinking tools and activities already and   are at this stage in the timeline , the learning launch is the right tool . As previously   mentioned , our team needs to review the information gained from our first two   releases and incorporate this information into future launch designs . Future   launch designs should reflect the information gained , the progress made , and   approach a compelling solution ready for full deployment .

"Challenge : 

 One friend of mine asked me for helping her with project for head of department of one 

 Government Ministry - to develop mechanism of effective interaction between government 

 structures in the framework of public procurement system . I work in this field but government 

 programs and their structure differs from things with which I work . But it was interesting for 

 me and some kind of level up . I agreed to help my friend . 

 The previous system was not effective and we need to explain all new which   we had 

 developed concept for a   person ( head of department ) who actually knows nothing about it and 

 ca n’t understand it . She has a very old and sophisticated work approach and rejected all ideas 

 and presentations of this project before . Project was not complicated for understanding for 

 specialists . We have described and repeated my friend speech several times for other experts 

 and they understand everything . I understand that the key problem was not in the project it was 

 in the order of project presentation to head of department . She   requires her subordinates to 

 describe everything in printed presentations or print papers for her and describe whole concept , 

 without the use of projectors or presentations on computer . It is easier for her to read and try by 

 herself get the idea , but long working day and huge flow of information had decreased reduced 

 her brain ability of perception of information from the text . I recommended my friend to use 

 visualization tool . 

 Selection : 

 Visualization is a way of unlocking a different part of your brain . Visualization is 

 anything from the picture which we has draw to the presentations and graphics that we create in 

 a presentation , or create an application .   Visualization , as like <NAME> tool , is really 

 important for explaining of idea or concept , but when you work with system where a lot of 

 elements it would be better to visualize it and how all elements are connected with each other . 

 Application : 

 I like brain studies and neurophysiology and i know that it 's really dificult at end of work day 

 understand information because your brain is ecxausted . And especially when you are the 

 headofdepartment with several sub - department and each of them have different projects and 

 you need to undestand them all to apply or modify before you give recommendation to transfer 

 them to another Ministry or another department . I tryed to be in her skinand understand what 

 exactly is so difficult for her to understand . And then i changed our presentation . Deletad text , 

 put some numbers , figures und arrows and added some animation . My friend was against , 

 arguing with me that they do n’t use projector or computer when they present for their boss . I 

 said – ‘ ’ Ok , but you can use   your IPad or smartphone ” . She looked at me like with suprice .   I 

 took her tablet and transferred new presentation there and updated it through special 

 application . All animation worked , numbers , figures and arrows were on their position . Friend 

 of my presented it . Her boss understand all concept and she was surprised then my friend 

 present it on the tablet without additional papers . It was easy for her to understand it through 

 moving figures and flashing arrows than through text ( as she was accustomed to read it and she 

 required it from her employees ) . 

 Insight & Approach 

 People are different and if you want them to get your idea or understand , try to use different 

 tools . We ( my friend and I ) tried visualization , even though her boss prefer a lot of text in printed 

 presentations without using computer devices . People differently understand information and get 

 the idea . Some of us quickly understand the essence some not . But simple approach and easy 

 information flow with some simple pictures and moving figures helped us .   First of all i tryed to 

 understand the person for whom it was presented . She is not an expert she was ecxausted by long 

 working day . I did n't use storytelling because she prefer to read and understand all information 

 by herself , so it 's not easy for to get huge information by listening . So if she prefer to get 

 information through her eyes let 's make it easier and add some animation that gave her a focal 

 point of the project . After this expirince i understand that you need to focus on your customer or 

 client or boss – make it easier for them to understand the point or use your information . Different 

 design thinking tools requires different approaches for different people andwe all are differet 

 right - thinked or left - thinked – no matter , one that 's matter that we need to change ususal things if 

 they do n't work effectivly anymore . 

 P.S : Since that time the head of department of Ministry has required from her employes who 

 present some « complex » projects – present it in tablets or laptops .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 My work in the organization is to lead Learning and Development and Employee Engagement and   Storytelling turns out to be a rather useful and solid tool for me to accomplish my objectives .   Storytelling compels others to take notice of what I am training them for and it is a strong tool for   generating curiosity and thus facilitating Engagement . An engaged employee is one who understands   the purpose of the organization and connects his work objectives with the goals of the company . To   instill this understanding in employees , storytelling becomes a very useful tool as it helps them   understand things in a better , engaging manner and reinforces the learning that we try to impart .   I   spend a lot of time interacting with people and training them in various skillsets such as soft skills ,   functional skills , etc . and more often than not , it becomes absolutely necessary for me to hook the   person ’s mind into what I am training them . By converting my messages into compelling stories , my   message is delivered in a way that is easy for them to absorb and understand and that makes it all the   more effective for people to implement the learning in a practical work context . It also helps them   ascertain their goals and deeply understand the whole system wherein training becomes just a bridge   for them to cross over to a more knowledgeable state of mind which is aware of the decisions they   make and the problems they solve . 

 Application 

 I had applied storytelling in various contexts but would share one such instance where I did that   recently . There was a workshop which I had taken on instilling our Organizational Core Values in the   employees and one of the topics was ‘ Humility and Respect ’ . I knew that if I explain this entire subject   with a powerpoint presentation it would sound too preachy and would not deliver the message as   effectively as I would ’ve wanted to . Hence , I decided to explain this from the context of a story that I   had read once as a teenager . This was the story of <NAME> <NAME> and how on his 50th birthday , they   had kept competitions across all the counties in <ADDRESS> to do an impression of <NAME> <NAME> and the   best impressionist who appears exactly like <NAME> would win the contest . Mr. <NAME> himself   contested from one of the counties , just to play a prank and there were many more who entered the   contest . In the end there were 3 people shortlisted for the final round among which one was the real   <NAME> . But when they announced the winner , it was no Mr. <NAME> himself but another person and it   was shocking to Mr. <NAME> that somebody can do my impression better than myself . This story was   told in a more engaging format to all and the moral of this story was to drive the fact that we can not   ever think we are the best and there is always someone who could be better than us and we must   remain humble and grounded at all times . The tool was applied effectively to facilitate employees ’   understanding of the subject at hand and facilitated their learning . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The story was received really well by employees and it was clearly impactful as they mentioned how   they understood things more clearly in their feedback post the training . It was quite insightful for me as   well as I understood that storytelling can actually create such a huge impact in help employees learn   values in a more engaging manner and the engagement aspect was at its peak during this exercise . 

 This course made me look at design thinking with a whole new perspective and although I had used it   before , it was randomized and not structured . The entire approach of What is , What if , What wows and   What works gives a clear structure to the entire thinking approach thus leading us to do things in a   more concrete manner and not in a random way . 

 This knowledge has really helped me in my Learning and Development career and would continue to   open up different possibilities in the future .

"1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 In the electronics / digital payment industry , there is a variant of payment card that 

 individuals or corporate could acquire without necessarily having an account relationship 

 with the bank nor a credit relationship . This class of card is called the Prepaid Card . The 

 major limitation of this card lies in its flexibility of onboarding , since minimal customer 

 information was received at the point of onboarding , most financial institutions do create 

 a standalone system for the management of both the financial and non - financial 

 functionality of the card , thus it makes customer experience not flexible enough . The 

 loading and unloading of the card by customers must be done in a semimanual way , as 

 opposed to the expectation of customers in the digital era . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and 

 why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture 

 references ) . 

 Mind mapping is a method of relating problems with possible solutions . Mind mapping 

 stands to answer the questions : do I really know the problem ? Is my thought of solutions 

 appropriate for the problem or could solve the problem ? I selected mind mapping tool 

 because it helps to understand the mind of customers by empathy . <NAME> to the video 

 lecture : Mind mapping tool by <ADDRESS> professor , <NAME> <NAME> . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what 

 you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 How I applied the mind mapping tool : 

 a. After the data collection , I presented the available data for everyone to 

 see . 

 b. Sent a survey to all members of the electronics banking team for 

 reaction , based on the data collected . 

 c. Each unit in the department is recognized as a cluster and they are 

 asked to select learning / data that forms a good idea . 

 d. We picked out the good stuff according to units as a cluster . 

 e. Review the observations of the participants and make insights from 

 them , on a unit / cluster level . 

 f.   Translate insights into design 

 Meanwhile , mind mapping is a design criterion , not the design itself . It is ineffective in 

 some ways because design thinking ( creating a creative design ) goes beyond only the 

 asks of customers as they might not even be able to identify their valid needs themselves . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your 

 challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about 

 design thinking more broadly ) . 

 An insight came up from the participants comment on the for prepaid card to act like 

 a debit card , but still with its minimal onboarding documentation requirement . 

 This insight gave a clue to the management of <ADDRESS> card , using the same IT 

 infrastructure as it is applicable in debit card with similar flow of transactions and 

 customer feedback mechanism . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you 

 selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 I should have collected data also on the other variants of payment cards , other than 

 the prepaid . This is to enable the participants to be more informed about the 

 functionalities .

 I was asked to lead a Congressional Relations team that is responsible for receiving inquiries from   Congressional leaders pertaining to delivery of healthcare by our company to their constituents .   The   first thing I was told was that the team had an inventory of inquiries which exceeded the number of   responses that could be completed each day .   The team was falling behind and under a great deal of   pressure .   Even with additional resources , the training time to get someone up to speed would not meet   the immediate concern about timeliness .   The expectation of the Congressional offices was to have   responses within just a few days , whereas our operations teams providing the data needed for a   complete response required much more time to investigate healthcare claims and initiate reprocessing .    Looking at the history of our response time , it had grown significantly along with the inventory increases   as well as the inventory of healthcare claims .   They needed a solution , but everyone was up to their   elbows in work and could not find the way out . 

 Selection 

 As a leader I have found that storytelling makes a situation more tangible to associates .   Dictating goals   or numbers often gives associates very little context or motivation . I considered using brainstorming or   mind mapping to identify a solution , however I first needed to get the team motivated to find a solution .   The video in Week 3 reminded me that Storytelling ignites engagement .   Where there is engagement ,   there is ownership .   This team needed to own the problem before they could start to solve it .   I had used   storytelling with another team that had a similar situation with inventory and had great outcomes with   getting them to understand “ why ” their work was important to the company , Congressional office and   even the patients .   I decided that this was the best approach to get the team thinking about how to   handle the situation with their inventory . 

 Application 

 To address our team ’s particular challenge , I wanted to share two stories : one specifically about the   challenge and one specifically about leading a team to success .   I needed the team to understand that   this is possible !   I brought them together in a conference room .   Some of the participants saw the   meeting as a welcome break from writing responses – clearly , they were not the ones engaged and the   primary target for this tool .   I began by telling the team about a specific Congressional inquiry I had just   reviewed .   The Congressional leader had been asked weekly about the status of an authorization for a   necessary medical procedure for a woman in his area .   He just wanted to give the patient an answer that   assured her we were aware of her request and the process that it had to go through before it could be   approved .   I shared with our team an example of when I had been in a similar situation , waiting for an   authorization for care and filled with worry for my son ’s health .   I explained that while I waited , I did the   only thing I could control – reach out to everyone who might be able to help or get me answers .   I   explained that this Congressional leader was trying to answer the patient ’s inquiries and help reassure   her .   As I shared , heads were nodding around the room – we were finding common ground and sparking   the desire to find a solution .   Next , I told them about how another team had gathered together and   explored any ideas they could come up with to find a solution to reduce their inventory or decrease 

 their handling time to increase productivity . When I shared the successful outcome that team achieved ,   they were ready to dig into our challenge . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 The team quickly engaged after hearing the two stories confirming that storytelling did , in fact , ignite   their motivation .   They collaboratively identified a few simple modifications to the workflow that they   could implement immediately : they proposed using templates instead of drafting messages for each   response , they also proposed acknowledgement responses to reduce multiple inquiries .   Some of them   even shared how they were using these solutions already but had n’t thought about bringing it to the   team .   By sharing with them the purpose or importance of our responses , they were all motivated to   tackle the challenge together .   Using a story to demonstrate the “ why ” of their work also created   empathy for their customer .   As a new leader to the team , adding the story of a previous success helped   boost their confidence that the challenge could be overcome .   The one thing the team did not do was   create a plan to implement their ideas and instead sought guidance from their management team .    Looking back , I would have added a second tool to approach the challenge : visualization .   By creating a   flowchart of the current process and sharing it with the team , I think they might have better understood   how to execute their recommendations through seeing where it fit into the process and would have   taken the initiative to design the actual process to implement their proposed solutions consistently .

"Learning Launch Tool :   Face to Face   Seminar - Workshops   to Online Workshops     Challenge :     In the <ADDRESS> , the financial services industry players , like the insurance companies , banks ,   brokerages , and investment houses , provide their clients ' or potential clients ' financial   education .   It is only in recent years that financial literacy became part of the education   curriculum .   For a long time now , most citizens gain financial literacy through financial services   providers who are most vested in their financial products ' sales .     I founded a training company focused on improving the Financial Literacy of the working   population in NCR .   One of our objectives is to provide unbiased financial literacy training that   will expose them to the various financial instruments available in the market but will not   compel them to buy .       Will the market pay to gain financial literacy when this is provided by financial services   institutions for free ?   How can I best serve the interest of my market ?     Selection :     We had experience in training as well as financial services . We wanted to start moving and   develop our ideas at work .   Thus , we decided that whether ready or not , we will conduct the    Learning Launch .   We wanted to deep dive into our users by interviewing them and meeting   them and running to them our program . We wanted to see their responses to our activities ,   their engagement on our material , and their overall satisfaction with the seminar - workshop .      admonished the need to identify the WOW ZONE .   The WOW ZONE   is where   customers ' wants , the program 's viability , and the company 's profitability converge .   We   wanted to find that zone through a series of experimentation .     Application :     We did our first Learning Launch to clients from different backgrounds but mostly within the   age range of 20 - 40 .   We offered the program to individuals who wanted to attend a workshop   on personal finance .   We had to experiment on several elements , price point , place of   execution , and promotions .     We succeeded in our first Learning Launch .   The clients had good reviews of the program . We   were able to execute it well . However , our margins were low .   We reviewed how we can   improve on our first launch and did the 2nd , 3rd , and Nth time .   Finally , when we can not see   how else to improve our profitability , we shifted gears and changed our target market . 

 Instead of individual clients , we had our first Learning Launch with corporate clients .   After a   successful execution and better margins , we found our WOW ZONE .   We identified that we   have a market , we can execute the program well , and profit from the venture .     Insight and <NAME> :     It was an excellent decision to put the program in the market , even if it was not perfect .    Learning Launch allowed us to discover that our intended market was not yet ready to pay for   our service at a price to be profitable .   It allowed us to continuously improve the program with   the users rather than at the planning table .   It paved the way for us to look at how we can   streamline our operations to improve our margin with our change in the target market .   It   sharpened our skills , strengthened our conviction , and enriched our experiences      We will continue to utilize the Design Thinking Tool , <NAME> <NAME> , moving forward in the   new normal .   Our seminars and workshops were designed to be done face - to - face .   With the   latest protocols in place , we can not do the same while we are in the pandemic .   Last week , we   completed our First Learning Launch for our Online Personal Finance Workshops .   We now have   the experience of the new process , feedback from users ' , and a program that was tested and   refined over a series of launches .   We are gearing up for the challenges ahead .

"VISUALIZATION 

 Visualizing is an art of understanding and making the fellow stakeholders understand the problem to   further come across the viable solution . It is used to achieve a shared understanding of a problem space   among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define possible solutions to   the problem . 

 Challenge and Selection 

 This is a case in a manufacturing plant which was facing a critical competition in the market . Few small   plants established in the nearby area resulting into diminishing recourses or high prices for the available   resources . The solution was to expand the business territory and sustain by getting enough raw material   and resources at a low price . But the major challenge was that it required a lot of capital investment and   the results were not certain . So to convince the stake holders I used the technique of visualization to   guide them with the proximity of the problem and even worse challenges that might occur in the future .   I have used various symbols for visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for   discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining   the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying   pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Application 

 Our main objective was to figure out the consequences and the opportunity cost if we do n’t initiate the   expansion . I started by creating a visual of the problem and then encoding different elements of the   case with a particular character or symbol . I will draw from any existing material available to understand   the environment . The existing material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials ,   or any marketing materials . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one of   the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . 

 So basically I tried to capturise the whole case and picturize it on the white board using different   symbols ( mentioned above ) . For involving each of the stake holders in the process I gave each of them a   certain situation related to the case and asked them to act accordingly . This enabled them to feel in to   the problem and get full in sights that are crucial to come with the definite solution 

 In the last stage all the stake holders came up with their different solutions that they would derive while   facing such problem . The feedback was further discussed and with certain agreement a solution was   figured out to combat the problem . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 It did work in a systematic way and by summarizing all the feedback we came to judicious decision .   What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while we divide the   elements of the problem to different people a better and a larger perception comes to place .   The   graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to share   their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they could   draw a image of the problem a sense of feeling help them in determining all the cause and effect factors   of the situation . This would certainly help them in coming up with desired action which is somewhere   tried and trusted in the mind already .

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 In my line of work , which is teaching , mentoring , and doing research , I always find it challenging   to provide a big picture of a research question to my students , especially my undergraduate   advisees . I always find them lost and puzzled after deciding on a research theme or topic .   Hence , I always look for ways on how to jumpstart their research initiatives . With the attention   span of students getting shorter and shorter , a visual representation of their research topic will   allow them to see what they are doing and in what direction they are going . In addition , prior to   engaging the researchers in their work , mind maps allow us to craft the focus of our work while   acknowledging constraints on time and resources . 

 Selection 

 A visual representation such as a mind map can provide a bird ’s eye view of how we approach a   research question . This tool provides us the opportunity to look at the state of the art as well as   the research gaps that can be addressed . This also encourages collaboration among the team   members . 

 Application 

 Once my student has selected a research topic or theme , I asked them to create a mind map of   their topic . Generally , the main topic is broad so that we can capture the current landscape of   the topic or the technology . The first mind map will be on the topic itself and how it branches   out to more specific sub - topics . There will be a series of meetings between me and my students   to try to improve the map and ensure that we have captured the interconnectedness of the   topics . The students usually work in groups to solicit contributions from their peers . 

 After the mind map of the topic , we create another mind map on the state of the art and the   available literature . This allows us to identify the current state of research initiatives , research   gaps , what other researchers are doing , and procedures used . This will allow us to plan our   activities and processes that will eventually have novelty and does not duplicate the works of   others . 

 The two mind maps will be used as our guide as we commence our research activities .   Throughout the implementation period , we continously assess our outputs and our efforts and   compare these to our mind maps . The comparison will tell us whether we are doing the   activities as expected or need to adjust along the way .   Sometimes , we also update the mind   maps if necessary . Flexibility and adapatability is very important in a highly creative atmosphere   with a lot of uncertainties . 

 Insight 

 Mind mapping is an effective visualization tool that immediately provides the big picture of a   research undertaking or any project . It offers a common ground that keeps everyone aligned   with the project . 

 Approach 

 Since I learned about mind mapping , I have included this in the courses that I teach . I want to   give students alternatives on how to approach a particular research question by looking at the   bigger picture using mind maps . In this way , they will be able to realize their potential   contributions to their field of interest . This activity can be easily integrated in any class or   course . Anybody can do this . In fact , I encourage my students to use this tool beyond the   classroom . It is a powerful tool for visualization especially in a collaborative environment .

"Challenge 

 Challenges are a part of everyday life . They make us stronger and without them life becomes somewhat   meaningless because we have nothing to compare the good times to . 

 These challenges come in many forms . For some , the challenge is doing well at school , for others it is getting   to grips with financial worries . 

 But , regardless of the challenge , facing up to it is key . Doing so will make you feel like you can take care of   yourself , it will also make you understand the value of what you have now . 

 Facing up to challenges and living through them give us the experiences that make up our life . 

 But it 's important to remember that , whatever the problem , there is almost always a solution . 

 Facing challenges is a way to push ourselves and see what we are capable of . 

 What 's more , when we look back on tough times , we can be proud of how we dealt with the challenge and   remind ourselves that life does get better . 

 Storytelling tool and Application . 

 It is a suitable tool to collected personalised experiences from the consumers . It may be hard to build a   generalised data based on it because of the different nature of each consumer ’s story , but I believe this is   one of the strengths of the tool . It helps us to understand the empathic experience that the users face when   using a product or a service . This unique strength point can be valuable for the design thinking process   especially when it targets specific problems such as medical interventions or personalised use cases . 

 In sum , the storytelling is a powerful communication tool that enables us as a human being to understand   more about our emotional experiences . This makes it an effective method to use during the design   process . It can be used during the design thinking process phases with a different goal in each stage . 

 Insights 

 Stories generate questions and questions expand the breadth and depth of stories , leading to lots of   innovative thoughts and ideas . Storytelling becomes an important tool for feedback , which is the basis of   the iterative process of prototyping that lead to solutions . Stories and prototypes are intertwined ,   explaining and repositioning experiences through a multitude of potential interpretations , which allow   researchers to test new solutions before committing exclusively to a particular policy , program , or service . 

 Storytelling helps explain the interconnections among people in situations and settings , teaching broad   lessons that engage real human beings . Listening engages people ; and empathy is an essential and   fundamental component in the process . 

 Stories take on a variety of forms : digital storytelling , visual storytelling , storyboards , scenario   generation , storytelling through videos , skits or plays , animation , talk and image , text or image . These 

 forms open up possibilities for many analytical approaches including , thematic , content , discourse ( use of   language ) , and structural . The trends and patterns derived from these analyses , in turn , form the bases of   additional qualitative and quantitative data collection that value human needs as the authentic foundation   of research - based challenges , opportunities and solutions . 

 Approach 

 Good stories always captivate audiences . 

 Define your target users with personas – to envision users ’ likely experiences and gain empathic   insights . Personas are based on user research but tell a story about your insights . 

 Create a plot , with conflict – to make the personas heroes and envision how they can overcome   specific problems using your design . 

 Give your design the supporting role – show it improving your persona’s / user ’s life and how   easy it is to use . 

 Work with the setting – When and where users use your design is vital for building empathy . 

 <NAME> the look / feel – Your design ’s appearance is vital regardless of its functional benefits , so   design the most appropriate ( e.g. ) layout , colors , typography .

"Design Thinking for Innovation : Visualization ( Module 1 ) 

 “ Evolving In - Person Events to a Virtual Experience ” 

 Challenge & Selection 

 It can be a challenge to conduct a productive design thinking session remotely with a large 14 - person   team in the current era of working from home . With professional events of all sizes quickly pivoting from   a typical in - person delivery to a virtual delivery model worldwide , my meeting planning team was posed   with a similar challenge . My team plans an annual event to host 350 + Manager - level employees from   across the US for an in - person 3 - day learning and networking event . Since large gatherings are currently   restricted with <NAME> , my team ’s challenge was to explore effective ways to convert a 350 - person   networking event typically held in person into a virtual offering while maintaining similarly high levels of   participant learning & engagement . How does one incorporate all the various aspects of a successful in- person event to life in an effective virtual capacity , while redesigning an engaging guest experience for   intimate professional networking and meaningful learning ? 

 Since my planning team ’s challenge to recreate a event experience was human centered at its core , I   selected the Visualization tool for my team to : 1 ) achieve a shared understanding of the problem – what   elements are essential to redesign an event experience effectively , and 2 ) kick - off a brainstorming   session to instill creative thinking for potential solutions . 

 Whiteboarding is a common visualization technique where various stakeholders write down what or   how they are visually thinking on sticky Post - It Notes and then physically stick / move these paper notes   at various points in the event lifecycle . In a 100 % remote working environment , the use of digital sticky   notes in breakout sessions for small group collaboration was a Visualization technique that enabled my   planning team to dive into idea generation . With a set of key questions , this visual thinking technique   prompted exploratory , abstract discussions as well as aligned group thinking to achieve consensus on   the event design approach in tangible , concrete , and productive way . 

 Application 

 Before our first group brainstorming session , it was important for me to do some preparation work for   the team . Prior to <NAME> and remote working , the planning team was originally segmented into four   workstreams : ( 1 ) Marketing & Communications , ( 2 ) Event Venue & Logistics , ( 3 ) Learning Content &   Agenda , and ( 4 ) Networking & Speaker Engagement , as shown in the Figure 1 screenshot below . 

 Figure 1 

 I started the process by mixing up the teams and creating new “ buckets ” or categories for each   component of the event domain . Since the team ’s ability to collaborate with sticky notes on a physical   whiteboard was not feasible , I divided the large team into small groups of 4 - 5 team members where   they participated in a small breakout session that focused on a different category of event design .   Assigning individuals to a specific group beforehand ensured a Lead / POC from each original event   workstream was represented in each small group breakout session . This approach diversified the type of   thought leadership and hypothesis ’ that would be generated within each breakout sessions . 

 Figure 2 

 The Figure 2 screenshot above illustrates the event design categories that prompted each Group 1 , 2 , or   3 to generate creative ideas and answer their respective question moving beyond the ‘ What Is ’ to   explore the ‘ What If ’ . I allocated approximately 15 - minutes for each breakout group to have relevant   discussions and synthesize their key themes on digital sticky notes . Figure 3 screenshot below illustrates   one example from one of the small breakout session results . 

 Figure 3 

 After the small breakout discussions concluded , I facilitated the team coming back together in a single ,   virtual forum to debrief . I asked each group to report out their takeaways , while I quickly captured the   shared commonalities and type of feedback it received from the rest of their team members . After the   session , I documented the meeting minutes , including the combined feedback , shared insights , open   questions , key concerns , and other considerations from the discussion , to distribute to my planning   team . This artifact now serves as a reference document that the team can always point back to as we   continue working through the details of event design . Documenting the key takeaways and shared   insights reinforces the group ’s understanding of the fundamental problem and shared insights that the   team can point back as a cornerstone for related decisions . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Establishing a clear understanding of the problem domain and developing core guiding principles based   on what my team agreed upon was a critical cornerstone to then progress forward in case conflict   arouse later in the ideation and/or execution phases . Since my team was early in the design thinking   process , there was lead time available for disagreement , inefficiencies , and ambiguity in order to 

 achieve consensus and decisions for the overall event design . The tool of Visualization solidified   alignment of our thinking and approach to the problem as well as drove shared insights for more   valuable results . Even though the way in which this annual event is delivered changed from an in - person   to a virtual experience , our human - centered challenge required us to level set context of the problem in   order to re - create a guest experience effectively and maintain its status as the # 1 ranked event attended   by Manager - level employees . 

 Using the tool of visual thinking with our challenge forced creative ideas to be explored with diagrams ,   instead of being verbally open for interpretation in a slightly different way . Thus , my team evolved its   thinking from a single activity set ( e.g. simply digitizing the same event content to be available on video   broadcasts without a physical event venue ) into a larger set of event design activities ( e.g. restructuring   design elements to make an event execution successful , engaging , and highly attended ) . 

 Practicing the use of visualization helps me become a better communicator – both written and verbally .   After taking this course , I realized that I do n’t have to have all the “ right answer ” to an open - ended   question , but I can leverage images to stimulate unbounded creativity , imagination , and exploratory   thinking . Without the support of visualization techniques , like categorization and the use of structured   color , innovative ideas generated risk getting “ lost ” if not quickly captured visually for further   exploratory discussion or risk overlooking the commonalities between insights . In our next planning   team session , I will practice additional visualization techniques , such as mapping process flows , to   explore the next level of detailed planning for a revised event schedule / agenda . While scheduled to   occur virtually in October 2020 , my team ’s redesign will consider all the insights shared on what makes   an effective , engaging , and compelling event .

"VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I used to do design thinking is Visualization . For me , I agree that visualization 

 stimulates ideas . I use this tool to create a product in one of my classes in the university . To 

 create a new product with some innovations are the challenge I get . Luckily it is a group 

 project , so there is more than one person to think and discover new ideas . It is hard to create 

 a product if we do not know the user of the product . So first of all , know the user , the user 's 

 needs , and then it is also important to know the limitation I have to create the product . Three 

 of those things are the key for me to do the design thinking . We also create a mission 

 statement for the product . With this mission statement we can create the product more focus . 

 The tools we use are persona and brain storming . 

 Application 

 First tool , persona . We search about the user who will use the product . This product is created 

 for university students who study about art and design . The persona we create , we think about 

 what will an art and design student needs , difficulties , characteristics , and habits . We also do 

 some research by doing some interviews with the art and design students . In gathering data 

 from the students , we can create the persona more detail . 

 Second tool , brain storming . As this project is a group project , so there are 5 people in the 

 group . There are 5 brains to think and discuss about the product . The brain storming starts 

 with knowing first about what product we want to make . We want to create a tool to help the 

 art students to bring their tools and materials to do the art . For examples , the brush , the 

 watercolor paint , the washing glass , and others . Then we sit around and prepare some papers . 

 Then we visualize the product by drawing it in the papers for 3 minutes , than we exchange the 

 papers and draw again to create more ideas . 

 Insight 

 Visualization in design thinking really help designer in designing the products . Using persona 

 as a tool in visualization help the designer to know about the user of the product well . Every 

 innovation in the product is created to full fill the user that described in the persona . The design 

 process is more focus as the base to do the design is the persona . The brain storming process 

 is also important because more ideas will be created . It combines everyone 's ideas and more 

 innovations are created . Everyone can generate ideas for the product and have a better result . 

 Approach 

 Visualization with persona and brain storming is good . But there are a lot of other tools that 

 might help design thinking . I might do differently next time , using different tool to visualize 

 ideas in design thinking . New tool that I will try to use is mind mapping . Mind mapping is a 

 good idea to get themes and patterns . So , the product 's ideas can be describe in detail in the 

 map .

"Visualization Tool for Green Field Technology Projects 

 Challenge & Selection : 

 Green field implementation technology projects are about creating a Software System that does n't exist .   Such projects have stronger goals related to deeper process improvements and it demands a stronger   understanding of how the Software System should look and function . My clients always have trouble in   connecting the DOTS and for getting the full picture of the project outcome i.e. the new Software   System . I have used "" Use Case "" based visualization for making the diverse business teams of my   customer to think how the different Requirements are connected to form the desired functionality of   the Software System . I convert the Requirements are get from my client 's business teams and change to   Visual Use Cases . Visual Use Cases has been the best Tool for visualizing the end solution Software   System , since linking requirements to Use Cases is very standard industry practice . So visually depicting   the Use Cases and connecting them makes life easier . I do this on a board or using Microsoft   Powerpoint , if the solution is very complex then Microsoft Visio or a tool like it would be used for   preparation of Visual Use Cases . 

 Application : 

 In almost all the green field projects I do record the requirements by scheduling the requirement   workshops . Once I get the requirements listed I typically convert one or more requirements into Use   Cases . After documenting the requirements and converting them to Use Cases , I do a presentation of   the To Be solution . I had tried traditional way of Visualizing using images and linking them , and display   using <NAME> or a <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . But they were nowhere close to giving a very clear picture like these Visual   Use Cases , since the essence of the requirements was not rightly represented in the traditional   Visualization . So , I convert my text - based Use Cases to Visual Use Cases and put them on <NAME> or MS   Power point based on the size and complexity of the Use Case representation . Visual Use Cases contains   images of humans , facilities and any other stakeholders . Visual User Cases helps to identify missed   requirements and any other gas during the To Be discussion thereby helping the project to get very less   defects mostly cosmetic defects during its Testing phase . Visual Use Cases can be applied even in   non - technology projects . The only pre - requisite is to understand the creation of Text based Use Cases   using the Requirements received . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 Whenever we think of using the concept of Design Thinking for Technology projects we can go for Visual   Thinking . Visualization as a Tool comes very handy during "" What Is "" and the "" What if "" phases . In the   "" What Is "" phase it helps in visualizing the situation and in the "" What If "" phase it helps during Brain   storming sessions for Ideation . Now in case of a <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> technology project it helps during   Requirements discussion and during the To Be <ADDRESS> phases . Requirements Discussion is like the   "" What Is "" phase and in this phase generic Visualization approach using images can be used to get a clear   picture . To Be Finalization phase is like the "" What If "" phase were the captured requirements are 

 reviewed using the Visual Use Cases approach . 

 Visual Use Cases have improved decision making during me To Be discussions during the Technology   projects . I believe faster and unambiguous decision is a key to any kind of project , and Design Thinking   projects would also immensely benefit by using Visualization as an essential tool . When thinking of an   alternative to the Visualization Tool I could n't think of any alternative one , I hope many of them would   agree to my point . Visualization is the key to innovation and people who Visualize in their minds i.e.   imagining are the ones who can come up with many new ideas . And this is not only my opinion , but this   point has also been found in the autobiographies of many innovators . "" A picture is worth a thousand   words "" goes a popular English phrase and this also emphasizes the point that the alternative to   Visualization is Visualization . And Visual Use Case a variant of the Visualization Tool should be used in a   green field project scenario .

"1 . The challenge . 

 The problem I am looking to tackle is to do with parenting children in this modern age .   I am seeking to   uncover insights into what problems / challenges modern parents are facing and uncover truths about   what today ’s parents believe about childhood , parenting , and what success looks like .   The reason I am   scratching at this area is because I have been contemplating opening a daycare / preschool , but am   unconvinced that this is the best action . I would like to use design thinking to gather deep insight into   some problems modern parents like myself are facing . 

 As an undergraduate student earning my degree in psychology , and from a background of working in   various children ’s programs , I found the research around early childhood , notably the importance of   play in early childhood , particularly compelling .   Ten years later , as I was fully round with the   expectation of my first daughter and feverishly reading parenting books covering topics that ranged   from attachment parenting , sleep and sleep training , music for brain development , singing to the baby   in the womb , stress levels and the developing baby , sexual abuse and predators , the effects of marital   stress on children , language exposure and the brain , vaccinations , childhood disease , illness , SIDS ,   breastfeeding , bottle feeding and on and on ... and feeling utterly inundated with so much information   but having access to very little real life support .   The postpartum depression and isolation that I felt   following the birth of my little girl casts a dark shadow on what should have been a wonderful time in   my life ( sans the utter lack of sleep of the first six months ) .   All of the good ideas , and theoretical   intentions of what my parenting was going to be went out the window as every day , in the early days ,   we were just trying to survive the day and keep the little creature alive !   As the years have rolled on and   I have been a participant ( parent ) an observer ( navigating the world as a person shepherding small   human beings ) and a listener ( interactions with other parents in contact with ) . I have developed my own   opinions of what I think some of the problems and needs are , what I would have wanted for myself . 

 2 . Design Tool : Visualization 

 The visualization tool from week one , <NAME> <NAME> discusses using pictures and words to diagram and   connect ideas .   I started with the topic “ healthy child development ” .   I first wrote out all the things that I   believe create a healthy childhood .   Things like : secure attachment , love , nutrition , sleep , music , play ,   reading stories , connection to nature , stable family life , and connection to a larger community , spiritual   practice , movement and running , building , and climbing .   I then wrote down things that I think are   challenges that parents are facing . Things like : working mothers have limited affordable and flexible   childcare options , stay at home mothers are isolated and need community and play groups , high risk   children have a lack of access to healthy developmental opportunities which perpetuates a negative   cycle of : school to prison pipeline , high school dropout rates and teen pregnancy .   Private preschools   have to charge high tuition to cover expenses or not keep teachers full time and therefore not providing   health insurance and benefits for working Americans , lower job satisfaction , lowers quality of work .   <NAME> and programs are under pressure to introduce academics despite a mountain of research   finding that play based programs are the most beneficial to healthy development .   I also added a couple   of ideas that came to mind as I was writing out all of these things .   <ADDRESS> like : need for a family   community center – what would meet needs in the best way ?   What about the elderly , retired ,   disabled … can they be part of the childcare solution ? 

 From here I realized that my assumptions about what I believed was important for the development of a   healthy child , was just that : MY assumptions based on MY experience and education .   I then tried to drill   down further and develop open ended questions to use when surveying both parents . 

 3 . Application 

 To begin , I decided to use the visualization tool to think more broadly about childhood and differing   childhood experiences .   I arranged pictures and words in groups .   From this activity I began to generate   bigger questions with the hopes that these are the questions used in a   Survey would get me closer to   the data needed to test if my assumptions : 

 The following questions were generated from the visualization tool : 

 1 . Children are   2 . The purpose of childhood is   3 . What things make childhood great ?   4 . What things make childhood less than ideal ?   5 . The 3 most important things I want to teach my children are 

 a.     b.     c. 

 6 . A successful adult has what qualities ?   7 . What is the best way to instill these qualities in young people    8 . One of the things that I am good at as a parent is   9 . One thing my parents were good at is :   10 . In a perfect world , I would want _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for my child   11 . In a perfect world , I would have access to this type of support _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   12 . In a perfect world I would _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   13 . My fondest childhood memory is   14 . A memory or situation from childhood that impacted you negatively   15 . If I could start over with my children , what would I do differently 

 Rate these items on a scale of 1 - 5 on your view of their importance to healthy development . 1 being not   important and 5 being very important . 

 Socialization   Sports / team play ( organized )   Play ( unstructured ) 

 Daily rhythm   Good nutrition   Structure classes 

 Outdoor play   Climbing/ running   Religion 

 Connected to community   Pretend play with others   Television 

 Stability   Marital / parental happiness   Singing / dancing 

 Nap time   Reading   Exposure to languages 

 4 . Insight 

 The first questions I generated were more narrowly defined , and trying to drive at a point that I thought   was important , like play and sleep .   However , I realized that that approach to the questions may just get   me to answers I am looking for , which could just be confirmation bias . What answers would I get if I   were to give a broad question “ what is a child ” for example and leave space for parents to tell me   anything that comes to mind . 

 5 . Approach 

 I just sent the survey to different parenting groups , play groups , neighborhood groups that I belong to .     Depending on the response from that , I may change are add questions .   I am very excited to being to see   what people respond and what I uncover from there .   I am gathering more research and am hoping to   curate that information and organize an upcoming brainstorming session .

"In this assignment , a reflective report will be presented considering my own thinking about the Design   Thinking activity . The weekly blogs and slides are already presented regarding the various activities   related to innovation and creativity managed through the use of various Design Thinking activities . It   will not only allow me to present a critical self - analysis but will also assist in reflecting the various   learning aspects and provide a justified explanation to the various activities involved during the   designing phases . This can beneficial for enhancing my depth of knowledge and even utilize my skills   and expertise to ensure that the knowledge acquisition , development plan and knowledge designing   activities remain successful all throughout . Not only the design thinking aspects , but also its impact on   the process of managerial decision making , use of tools and techniques along with the identification   of issues and determining effective solutions to deal with those problems associated with the   innovative solutions ( Johansson?Sköldberg , Woodilla & Çetinkaya , 2013 ) . As the topic is based on the   concepts of innovation and sustainable development , so the Design thinking activity is an important   aspect of enabling innovation and for ensuring successful management of the business strategy   process and at the same time , facilitate knowledge development and analysis of aspects to provide   critical reflective analysis too . 

 Critical self - analysis 

 From the Design thinking activity , I have understood about the visualizing of certain business   management aspects and innovation related to it . The entrepreneurship concept is related to the   business aspects where the individuals are allowed to gain good scopes and opportunities without   much focus on controlling the flow of resources while it also involves turning the idea into business   and ensuring that the human resources , financial resources and budgetary implications are managed   well and good . The concept of innovation is related to the formation of new ideas , concepts and   models required to enable innovation and creating a stable culture to foster new ideas and learn from   mistakes . With the learning of concepts related to entrepreneurship and innovation , I have learned   about how to start a new business , manage proper budget and the human resources properly too for   dealing with the business risks and produce good quality products and services ( Goetsch & Davis ,   2014 ) . From the idea , I have also found that the innovation problems and business risks that shall be   dealt with to create new and improved services along with redesigning the existing services . 

 Based on the model of innovation proposed by Tidd & Bessant ( 2013 ) , I have understood about the   various components such as the search , select , implement and capture . By assessing the model , I have   seek knowledge regarding the best opportunities to facilitate innovation , need and ways of enabling   innovation , define methods to innovate and capture ideas to gain relevant benefits from the   implementation ( <NAME> , 2015 ) . The different aspects of innovation including the incremental   innovation , platform innovation , component and discontinuous innovations can also assist me in   designing an effective platform that will promote innovation and utilize the major technologies and   core competencies to foster innovation of business . From the perspective of innovation , it is   understood by me that innovation can be managed by making changes to the design and functional   features of the products , changes to the processes , changes to the position along with the change in   paradigm to ensure that the innovation is successful ( Goldschmidt & Rodgers , 2013 ) . These are the   basic ways that foster innovation through improved business operations ’ efficiency , increased   revenue generation , higher productivity along with greater customer satisfaction and keeping the   costs incurred during the management of business processes under control . Being social and enabling   social innovation are integral aspects that facilitate social changes and can make the businesses fulfill   its corporate social responsibilities too . All these aspects are surprising and the reason is that it can   allow me to progress in my career and become a successful entrepreneur as well ( <NAME> , 2014 ) . 

 Reflection of learning based on the Design thinking activity 

 The learning capability is facilitated by me through the assessment of Design Thinking activity and   Design process associated with the reflection to be provided for the concerned report . Have been   accustomed with the use of designing of applications and even used the Dweck ’s theory , though I was   unable to conduct a feasibility study properly . It is important for me to focus on understanding   whether the design process for enabling innovation can be successful or not by breaking down the   design thinking process into multiple aspects like journey mapping , analysis of value chain , mind   mapping , conducting brainstorming sessions , developing relevant ideas and concepts , making   assumptions during the testing phase , rapid prototyping , creation of more customer and finally launch   of learning and development plan , all managed through proper visualization techniques ( Mootee ,   2013 ) . As the innovation concept involves changing the features and functional abilities of the product ,   the rapid prototyping model can be done on paper by creating 2D structures while the later rapid   prototyping concepts are understood by me . This has enhanced my strengths in the field of   constructing 3D designs and creating robust systems and products to meet the business standards .   Few of the weaknesses of mine include lack of knowledge about conducting role plays , wire framing   and story boarding , which often created a lot of complexities in managing the design process for   producing the ultimate product or service through innovation ( Seidel & Fixson , 2013 ) . The prototyping   methods are wire framing , paper prototyping , sketching and conducting role playing sessions could   be possible with the assessment of a proper case study to analyze the entire situation in details . This   has made me think like the user of services and even strengthened my skills , knowledge and expertise   regarding the use of suitable prototyping techniques to learn , test , think of getting investments and   obtain inputs along with proper funding and utilization of inventor syndrome to foster innovation all   throughout . It has been a fun while learning about the prototyping methods and it can also assist in   managing the feasibility study to understand the benefits of innovating products and services through   use of proper models and frameworks ( Gasparini , 2015 ) . 

 One of the major weaknesses faced by me is the lack of experimentation done within the market place   and due to this ; I faced barriers related to understanding the marketplace conditions too . The learning   launch planning could assist me I overcoming the barriers faced furthermore move from the   hypothetical concepts to real customers ’ behaviors and remain open to feedbacks provided by the   clients to make necessary changes ( Carlgren , Rauth & Elmquist , 2015 ) . Few examples include   innovation of Nicorette managed through the learning launch to establish a smoking cessation   initiative with the use of proper media channels via internet . As I have previously worked as an IT   engineer , I am habituated with the use of IT components along with management of databases ,   networks and internet connectivity , which can help me to create channels to deliver the right   messages and information to people and make them know about the initiative undertaken by <NAME>   to reinvigorate Nicorrette ( Lammi & Becker , 2013 ) . To implement the learning launch activity properly ,   it is important to maintain tight boundaries associated with the time , location and goals assessment   along with fostering the development of diverse teams to provide conflict resolution mechanisms .   Because of my good interpersonal skills , I have managed to cope up within a diverse workforce team ,   which has continuously prioritized on the customers ’ experiences and their expectations . To promote   effective learning launch , it is important to maintain proper values and ethics and make behavioral   interpretations that are required to utilize the design components and prototyping techniques for   making prior assumptions regarding the innovation aspect ( Geissdoerfer , Bocken & Hultink , 2016 ) .   Not only do my creativity and innovation skills have improved , but also the ability to manage business   properly with effective designing concepts are known to me . 

 The learning based on the Design Thinking activity is facilitated with the obtaining of information from   various sources related to the ways by which problems can be dealt with along with development of   skills . This will also assist me in developing creative problem solving approaches for the creation of   value and benefits . It can also enable me to think as a designer , furthermore assist in developing   growth potential and study the various aspects of business such as the assumptions of reality ,   rationality , objectivity and even fostering social constructive approaches for gaining a better answer 

 to the designing methods used in business ( Welsh & Dehler , 2013 ) . The processes involved in the   design activity could include analysis and planning processes where the actions to be undertaken could   be identified . This would also make me capable of maintaining proper values and ethics , furthermore   promote better control , flexibility and stability along with better control over the business and   conducting the target market segmentation along with the analysis of behaviors of customers   regarding the purchase of products and services ( Dweck , 2013 ) . 

 Development of knowledge regarding Design Thinking activity 

 I have obtained sufficient knowledge and information related to the Design Thinking activity by   conducting the REAL launch , which could be beneficial for managing successful business activities and   increase the revenue generation capability too . The knowledge and information obtained according   to the Design Thinking activity include the objectivity , rationality and predictability of various actions   undertaken and furthermore make an analysis of various methods and processes associated with the   designing activity ( <NAME> , 2016 ) . This could assist me to perform my roles and responsibilities as an   efficient marketer and ensure that the segmentation of target market is done properly along with the   assessment of behaviors and needs of people while making purchases of pr0ducts and services . By   understanding the design thinking activity , I would be able to be creative and experiment with various   things for predicting the varying behaviors and changing needs of clients , furthermore present data   analytically and manage proper hypothetical planning approach to management of innovation . From   my perceptive , the deign process might be complex , though it should be considered that the design   process should be broken down into multiple components and design tools for innovating and bringing   creativity all throughout ( <NAME> , 2013 ) . My personal development could be possible with the   acquisition f knowledge and information based on the DT process , which includes discovering ,   defining , designing and delivering the most effective solution . 

 There were few areas of weaknesses , which often created complexities for me to manage the business   functions properly and thus to improve the attentiveness , I watched the values and interpreted those ,   furthermore made sure to consider the problems as opportunities rather than considering those as   limitations or constraints . By listening attentively to what the higher authorities speak , I would be   more willing to learn and prioritize on the present reality and not just the future . This could not only   make them accept the views and opinions of other team members , but would also allow me to share   and exchange my ideas with others to foster collaborative working . One of the major barriers faced   by me has been the organization developmentposters , which I was not much habituated with ( <NAME> ,   Keogh & Walker , 2013 ) . The design thinking activity should assist me in understanding the messages   to be delivered , maintain proper page layout , use proper visual aids , add the right colors and fonts ,   sequencing and provide references . The knowledge and information have been developed with the   design thinking activity through and it can facilitate critical and creative thinking for resolving issues   and problems , furthermore keep the processes user centered . This will surely assist me in developing   a systematic approach and ensure that the problems are resolved with much ease and effectiveness   along with maintenance of flexibility and innovation perspectives such as visualization , testing ,   prototyping methods and brainstorming sessions ( <ADDRESS> , 2016 ) . As an entrepreneur , it could also   help in assessing the needs of the customers and underpin the technological aspects for meeting the   business requirements and ensure business success and longevity 

 Figure : Action Plan ( Rayna & Striukova , 2016 ) 

 The action plan provided an insight about how the empathize , i.e. , to understand the audiences is   essential , define the approaches to construct a view , gather ideas through brainstorming sessions ,   develop a prototyping method and test the results based on the feedbacks to identify any changes or 

 improvements to be made . All these are based on the acquisition of knowledge and it can be obtained   by assessing the four major components of design thinking activity including the connecting , creating ,   collaborating and converting . The connecting approach of design thinking activity can combine the   analytical and creative approaches for resolving issues in business and at the same time ,   understanding the needs of clients and their behaviors regarding purchases too . The create aspect   enables creation of prototypes and transforming the ideas and concepts into something more tangible   to ensure technological efficiency while undertaking the project . The collaborating approach , as the   name suggests , has managed connection between the internal and external individuals to conduct   brainstorming sessions along with sharing and exchange of information and messages for identifying   the areas that need changes or have been left unexplored ( Rayna & Striukova , 2016 ) . The conversion   means transforming the ideas and concepts related to the prototyping into market scopes and   opportunities for delivering value and benefits to the customers . This will not only align the strategies   with the business goals , but can also maintain technological feasibility to ensure customer value   creation and launching a project in the test market too . All these major aspects have contributed to   the development of knowledge based on the design thinking activity , furthermore allowed me to   experience various aspects of lifelike value chain creation for Woolworths , preventing unethical   behaviors within organization and even establishing goo communication with others while working as   a team ( Jin , Li & Gao , 2013 ) . The interviews conducted with the managers of organizations have   improved my skills of practice interviewing , which can not only assist in managing the ongoing design   thinking activity properly , but will also facilitate critical thinking for innovation and creativity all   throughout . Knowledge and learning aspects are promoted easily s I have understood about the   Dweck ’s theory and it will allow me to progress in personal and professional career with much   convenience . The visualization of various business aspects and learning to create posters and knowing   about the prototyping methods can also establish a sense of positive skills and knowledge required to   promote effective learning and design activities effectively ( Liedtka & Ogilvie , 2011 ) . 

 Conclusion 

 From the report , it could be understood that own thinking was developed regarding the Design   Thinking activity and most of the facts were related to the innovation and creativity . The topic   illustrated about how the design thinking activity and its related aspects could assist me to progress   on my career , furthermore could make me present myself as a successful entrepreneur and manage   business successfully too . The critical self analysis would define the various aspects of innovation that   should help me in manage value creation while the reflection of learning based on the Design Thinking   activity could allow me to frame the prototypes and manage the design process to manage consistency   of product creation and managing the feasibility too . There were various weaknesses , that should be   overcome with the utilization f my strengths and this would contribute to assessment of behaviors of   clients regarding their purchasing habits in business , furthermore develop optimum level of   knowledge and information to create an action plan as well . I also understood about the ways of   developing posters and manage visualization of data and information , which could also improve the   skills , knowledge and expertise in dealing with the business issues that might be faced .

"Design Thinking- Final Assignment : Storytelling 

 1 . Challenge 

 My job at the organization that I work with is all about CX , where I have to be able to understand   customers and convey their messages and feeling to leaders . Essentially I do a lot of <NAME> . 

 In this case , my challenge was to convey a specific customer journey to the organization through   the means of storytelling . For the purpose of communicating opportunities that could be taken for   all the organization ’s departments to improve customer experience . 

 Therefore , the customer ’s journey for this company had to effectively be conveyed to move   managers and make them aware of the customer ’s pains and needs . Highlighting the pain areas . 

 Customer journey is the experience an organization ’s client has by buying its products or receiving   its service . For example , buying some fruit from Walmart or getting a credit card at HSBC bank .   This begins from the very first moment a client has contact with the company may it be through   the internet , a friend , etc ; and up to when a client experiences the result of the product or the   service itself . This process then just iterates . In this analysis mostly qualitative data is gathered and   the results are guided by insight , which are composed of opinions and feelings . Then it is   important to choose the most impactful opinions and emotions to present in the best way . 

 2 . Selection 

 For this challenge , I ’ve selected the tool of : Storytelling . 

 Storytelling essentially is a tool that helps tell a story just as it ’s writing in its name , it conveys a   message with emotional connection and a larger purpose . It is now used by organizations to   transmit their brand ’s essence and story because “ connects to the emotions , the characters , the   values of the people that live that product [ or service ] everyday ” . Then , if I wanted to achieve a   powerful moving impact to transmit the customer ’s journey , storytelling is a good tool to achieve   this . 

 The Journey that is also composed of the customer ’s opinions and feelings plays along nicely with   the storytelling tool , since it is supported by an emotional connection but also by a larger purpose   which is the achieve CX improvement throughout the organization . Therefore , through this tool I   would be able to “ take the listener along on their journey ” , inspire and make them want to take   action . 

 3 . Application 

 Discussing on how to portray the customer ’s journey we came up with an idea . In order to achieve   storytelling effectively we first noted all the relevant pain points throughout the analysis . Since we   did interviews we were able to note down the exact words said by the customers but also their   facial expressions . In turn , we extracted the video parts where relevant quotes on their pain points   were mentioned . These extracts were then categorized into pain points . These would be useful to   portray the customer ’s feelings and expressions during their journey . 

 After showing the videos relevant insights were needed , therefore for every customer journey   phase , the pain points were noted down with qualitative data that would finish sustaining the pain   point . 

 Design Thinking- Final Assignment : Storytelling 

 Lastly the opportunities were noted after the data for each phase beside several quotes to obtain   again an emotional connection . This was all presented to the organization ’s leaders , mentioning   first the challenge and that they could be part of the action plan , followed by the videos displaying   the profile of each interviewee and the insights gathered for each phase . Lastly the opportunities   and suggestions we gathered that could be taken for them to improve all of the interviewees and   their client ’s journey . 

 In result , I believe the tool was applied effectively however there could have been missing some   lingering questions for the audience . 

 4 . Insight 

 The presentation giving with the help of storytelling was a success . The emotional connection we   were able to convey specially through the videos was amazing , and the story follow up of the   interviewees with the insights and opportunities was at its point . Leaders were able to closely feel   their clients and get moved by their opinions . One of the most important aspects is not just   showing the information but really engaging the audience on the story of each customer and   letting them know their opinions . Therefore , the speaking part is very important and has to be a   prepared person that know the context and the data . However , the data was also important since   the audience were leaders they were specially looking for number and relevance . 

 5 . Approach 

 Next time we would include more “ lingering ” questions to better engage the audience , maybe use   more visual context for the opportunities to create an emotional connection as well . Like , “ how do   you think <NAME> felt after this issue ? ” .   On the other hand , mind mapping could have been another   tool to display to leaders their customer ’s journey and get them maybe more emotionally engaged   and inspired into taking action . By showing them scattered pieces of quotes and emotions but also   data , that they could see and determine then by themselves opportunity areas needed to get rid   of the customer ’s pain points .

"Visualization 

 Challenge    I ’m a student pursuing my masters in the field of robotics . One of the topics of study is 

 forward and inverse kinematics , which involves mapping the movement of various parts 

 of the robot to overall movement and vise - versa . Often , we are given questions where 

 there are more than four moving parts and imagining their movement is quite difficult . 

 Selection 

 I have used the visualization tool , as it is the most apt solution for materializing the 

 calculation in question to something   tangible almost similar to the actual robot . 

 Application 

 I have selected RoboAnalyzer as the visualization tool , as it provides the simulation of 

 the robot manipulator with the help of animation . As mentioned in the visualization tool 

 lecture this tool can also be helpful , when creating a new robot manipulator . 

 The given information in the question , like the joint angles , link lengths etc is given as 

 input parameters to the tool and it generates the animation showing the different link 

 movement . This tool is quite effective as it provides a reference to verify the answer and 

 also visualize , perceive the complex mathematics involved in the question . 

 Here a image of RoboAnalyzer , 

 Insight 

 The insight that i have gained is that the use of visualization is ​an effective way to 

 communicate abstract ideas . 

 Approach 

 The visualization tool helps capture new concepts and ideas , make them tangible . It 

 provides a language understood by everyone . Making the idea visible reduces the risk 

 which may arise in future .

"Reflection – Storytelling – <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge : A challenge that I experienced not too long ago involved the process of teaching a   group of fifth grade students about the roles that each person plays in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> economy   and how to connect their skills and passions to their future careers . The students had recently   completed a small project regarding the free market system and how a capitalistic society   rewards people in exchange for labor , which was followed by the presentation of a chart   highlighting the highest paying positions at the time . Each profession ’s salary level was captured   by a number of accompanying dollar signs , with one dollar sign being low paying roles and five   dollar sign indicating high paying positions . 

 As a follow up experiment , I asked the group of students to individually share their 

 aspirational career paths . Students who previously stated their dream jobs as “ construction   workers ” and “ softball coaches ” had changed their answers to match the high paying roles of   anesthesiologists or lawyers . Of course , those careers are not realistic for most students . My   challenge was to find a way to explain the importance of every career path and help students   understand that their future lifestyles could be financially supported by a position that better suits   their passions and interests . 

 Selection : In order to tackle the issue , I resorted to the storytelling tool . The visual tools that   were included in my lesson had taken away the important focus of students learning about the   economy : Find a career that suits your interests instead of interests that fit your career . This is   synonymous with the popular phrase of “ find a job that you love and you will never work a day   in your life . ” I believed that storytelling would allow for my students to better understand where   their interests and passions intersected with real - life career paths ; it would be a more   personalized approach in comparison to the simple literature utilized earlier in the lesson and   would be a chance for students to be introspective in the scope of understanding themselves and   the economy that lies ahead of them . 

 Application : I started the storytelling exercise by informing all the students that they were no   longer fifth graders , but rather prolific authors attempting to write the next bestselling novel .   Their novel would be similar to the George and Geoff stories in the week two module ; they   would create a character of themselves by mentioning their skills , passions , and interests , as well   as invent some background details including other family members and lifestyles . After they   created their character of themselves , I supplied some details to help build their stories from that   point onward . For example , a student had described himself as creative , but also loved   mathematics , so I shared a few careers within the engineering career path . Although it was   unknown to him prior to the lesson , the career had piqued his interest and he desired more   information . I described the path that his character would take to achieve that career designation ,   including attending college , majoring in a certain field of engineering , and pursuing internships   before graduating . The student took all the information and molded it into a story that he could   foresee himself following in the future . 

 The group of students produced a wide variety of personal interests and skills , leading to 

 many different stories being written . The process of self - analysis was integral to finding career   paths that many students had never expected to be interested in . I believe this approach is much   more efficient in comparison to the reverse , where the student identifies a career path ( usually   based solely on high expected salaries and elevated social statuses ) and then attempts to fit the 

 mold for that selection . This is an example of a poor fit ; somewhat akin to a toddler trying to   push a square - shaped block through a circle - shaped hole . After having the entire class finish   their stories , I requested that they share their stories with a few of their classmates . The other   students were amazed to see the variety of career paths open to them . As an interesting follow- up , I asked their primary teacher to save the letters and share them with the students prior to   graduation . 

 Insight : This process of storytelling was highly effective in helping the students conduct a self- analysis in conjunction with exploring future career paths . For many students , they were very   lost and were allowing external forces to guide their interests . They were previously presented   with a well - defined career path based on what was popular in our current market , which placed   constraints on what the students believed they could achieve . After this exercise , the students had   a better understanding of their passions and skills , as well as a strong grasp on the paths they   would take to achieve their newfound career aspirations . 

 Approach : If I were to attempt this exercise again , I would have the students go even deeper   with the subject . I focused mainly on how their passions and interests would fit into their   personal career , but it would have been more effective to also show the students how their   careers would play a role into the national economy . To modify the approach , I would begin with   their personal story creations and then transition them into real world situations to show how   they interact across career field boundaries . For example , businessmen and engineers have   completely different paths leading up to their professional positions , but often interact in the   business realm . This would help enforce the concepts that careers are not separated by hard   boundaries , but rather are all a part of a large community .

"Example reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am a lead data scientist in an elderly care project . The aim of this project is to provide an IOT   technology driven complementary healthcare system to assist the daily work of healthcare   providers , and improve the quality of life for elderly patients . There are three main stakeholders in   this project , namely the elderly patients and their family members , the healthcare providers ( i.e. care managers of the patients ) , and IT technicians ( i.e. software engineers , data scientists , IT architects ) . 

 The challenge of this   project is that there are lots of variations of the design of potential system ,   from sensor selection , IT architecture design , data collection , analytic objectives , and results   display . Especially , if we rely on one set of system selection and go through the whole loop to   collect real data and test the system . The cost of failure could be huge and unrecoverable . 

 Selection 

 User experience is crucial for the success of the project . Therefore we decide to take a agile   approach to communication with stakeholders through frequent feedback delivery loops . We split   the IT system into three main components , i.e. sensor selection and deployment strategy , data   analysis pipeline , and results visualization . Based on our experience in relevant technique domains ,   we proposed a set of sensor kit options , and data analysis prototypes , as well as data visualization   designs . We set learning launch targets at different stages of the project to collect user feedback to   test our hypothesis and adjust the system design . 

 Application 

 For our first learning launch , we aimed at narrowing down the sensor kit selections and result   visualization design , to understand the users ’ preference and needs . We recruited 20 elderly patients   who are potential users of the system , and elderly who are simply curious . The end product has to   be a compromise between technique complexity and the usability ( user interaction required , and the price ) . We grouped the selected sensor kits into different categories accordingly to the amount of   user interaction required , and their capabilities . We create result visualization interface based on   public dataset and mock data that we created . During this session , we have gain valuable   information in terms of sensor selection , and what information ( result visualization ) to feed to the   users . 

 Our second learning launch focused on testing several prototype IT structure , and data analysis   pipeline based on real data collected from volunteer patients . The aim is to get ready for a first hand user experience of the running system . During this session , we were able to communicate with users about how an edge based system could offer , and what we could achieve with a powerful cloud- based service , as well as what service is necessary for a real - time feedback , while another could   afford a delay . 

 We launched several more rounds of learning launch afterwards . At each round we tested hypothesis that were set beforehand . Through these launches , we were able to get closer and closer to a system   prototype that offers users the best experience , and a backend IT system that offers   robust and   seamless service to the elderly patients . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning launch tool in an agile way , our team were able to efficiently communicate with the target users and narrow down the hypothesis of various technological tool kit options .   Additionally , the process has brought the stack holders in a closer healthy relationship , by taking   care of users ’ feedback in the design loop , which has largely increased the confidence of the elderly   patients into using our system . 

 <NAME> 

 Given the success of applying the learning launch tool in this project , I would like to continue   practising it in future projects . However , various types of project may require different degrees of   efforts to launch from the technicians as well the end users . Therefore , carefully set hypothesis ,   goals , and reasonable time line is very crucial to a successful project , as well as to build a healthy   relationship among stakeholders . I would like to pay extra attention in these factors in the future .

"I happen to spend lots of time driving . When I drive , I tend to think about how others 

 behave on the highway . I ’ve always been interested in transportation economics . It was only 

 natural that I started thinking of the externalities caused by driving to test my idea . Was 

 it possible that the individual costs of an accident were so high that crash tax would not do any good . 

 I began my research by refreshing my understanding of externalities and crash taxes , 

 going back to old economics textbooks . But I needed to know more , so I began accessing other 

 papers on traffic economics . This would have been impossible without access to the seemingly 

 limitless information available through the University Library ’s Research Port . I was able to 

 access articles from the top economics journals using <NAME> and <NAME> . I even had to 

 look up textbooks on fields I was not familiar with , such as transportation engineering . I would 

 have had little access to these kinds of sources without access to <ADDRESS> ’s libraries . 

 I knew of some important articles by reputation , but it was more difficult to determine the 

 relevance of more obscure studies . By seeing how often articles were cited by others . 

 I could gauge which papers made significant contributions to the field . By reading curriculums vitae of 

 the authors , I learned which scholars were experts in which fields . Even these techniques did not 

 answer all my questions , however . I knew I needed to consult an expert . 

 I met with <NAME> <NAME> , a transportation professor in the business school . 

 <NAME> was extremely helpful in identifying where to find additional information . He 

 instructed me how to access online data from the Department of Transportation . 

 After several discussions with my <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> I decided that I had neither 

 the time nor the resources to conduct the kind of empirical analysis I originally desired . I still had 

 enough data and enough ideas to address the topic theoretically , however . 

 As my research continued , I began to see how I could modify standard economic models 

 to communicate my ideas . An economics PhD student , <NAME> showed me how to 

 electronically construct the graphs I would need to use to convey my conclusions . As my project 

 neared completion , I showed portions of my paper to both <NAME> and <NAME> , to 

 make sure that my arguments were sound and were communicated clearly . The input from 

 <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> was invaluable . 

 From this research , I learned just how time consuming it can be to access large datasets . I 

 also learned how important it is to discuss ideas with others who are knowledgeable in the field . 

 Discussions with experts complement reading works published by other authors . This project 

 also proved how important it is to be able to utilize diverse information sources , because often 

 research will take you into fields beyond your area of expertise . Of course , the experience of 

 composing my own research was priceless . 

 In the end , I am proud of this research . I believe it asks an important question and 

 examines economic theory from a new perspective . And it was extremely satisfying to follow my 

 thought experiment through to its conclusion

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 Challenge & selection 

 <NAME> is a great tool that I use at my place of work every day . I work with the key   population in the community . I spend most of the time in the hospital and at the community   interacting with people who have received a diagnosis from an illness . Most of the time these   people end up to be so vulnerable in the community especially when they realize that they are on   life time / long term treatment . These people are more likely to encounter stigma and   discrimination within the community they live in . This can make them get lonely , stressed , easily   angered and can evenly develop depression resulting into poor adherence to treatment and   suicide . I engage on one on one discussion with the young people and the elderly who are   affected in one way or another . I let my clients share out their experiences and life challenges of   their day to day life and how they cope up . Most of the people I meet normally feel so relieved to   share their stories as I share my experiences and knowledge on an equal level . This in turn helps   them see life in a different and positive perspective way . 

 Application 

 With the story telling tool I have been able to take my colleagues through this and we now use it   on a daily basis since the scope of work is the same . This tool has greatly improved our   efficiency and interaction with our clients . We can clearly communicate and this will play a   bigger role in our overall performance as an organization . Using this approach is quite easy to   identify the unique needs of an individual . It is also a way of finding out the root cause of the   problem to people or clients who are not able to share out when asked about any challenges that   they encounter . 

 Through a support group I had established at the community level for people on life time / long   term treatment , I was able to pick up a young lady who was doing so poor in her treatment   journey while other people in the group were doing well . The health condition of the client kept   on deteriorating and we could not really figure out what was the problem , but through having a   discussion with her I picked out the social issues that were affecting her . She shared out her story   saying that she has been taking care of her four younger siblings with no source of income and   they are orphans and have no one to depend on . This made her worry and lose hope in life in turn   affecting her treatment . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The story shared really gave me an idea of what she was undergoing and it was a chance to share   out my story of an experience of my own . I shared the experience I had at first when one of the 

 children of a support group I had established from a previous project was diagnosed with an   illness which needed long term treatment and how I had to ensure that he gets to the hospital for   an admission then later on taking him for the scheduled clinic appointments . This was hard for   me seeing him going through all the pain he was feeling and having to take his doses without   missing and knowing well that he has no one to look after him since he is an orphan . I was happy   to share how the boy is on his journey to recovery and doing really well at the moment and he is   doing some casual work to be able to cater for his personal needs . From this story the lady   gained some hope and promised to get some casual work to provide for her siblings and be able   to stick to her treatment in order to regain her health back . I was encouraged that it worked well   and she was happy again and this time round more focused . 

 This gave me an opportunity to share this story to my team members and they were really   impressed on how I had handled the issue . This will be used as an example to make some   reviews on the organizations ’ policies , an exercise which is currently underway . 

 This tool , especially the course itself has really helped me put my ideas into action and at the end   I see the efficiency and effectiveness of it and now I can take up the lead of my team members   and see how best we can boost our performance using this tool and what I have learnt in the   whole course .

"Learning Launch Application – Proposal Management 

 Challenge 

 I am part of Insurance Business Unit ( BUs ) business development / proposals management team for   operations / services of a repute organization . Similarly there are other 4 BUs managing their own business   development / proposals teams separately and working in silos . Each team consists of around 12 – 15   members doing multiple activities . All teams support their respective sales teams and in turn work with   other downstream teams for all the proposal inputs . Recently due to increasing demand from corporate   for better sales & support and at reduced cost led to this team re - structuring project exercise . The project   objective was to create a new Ways of working by re - structuring the overall teams to reduce overall   support cost and enhance the sales & support .   One base hypotheses to start was that ~60 % – 70 % overlap   work between the teams hence the overall structure & cost can be optimized to that extent . We have key   stakeholders in terms of 30 sales leads and 50 downstream leads . 

 Selection 

 We constituted a team of 10 with involvement from each BU and corporate . We agreed on the common   project scope with defined timeline of 12 weeks to propose the detailed findings to the leadership for   implementation . We wanted to test a Shared Service Business development model . 

 Corporate ensured that all the team members goes through the design thinking process and tools   trainings . We agreed to proceed with <NAME> <NAME> tool to experiment with Shared Service model idea   for couple of proposals to derive the percentage optimization possibility and sales / proposal development   enhancement / faster . 

 Application 

 We conducted brief surveys with all the involved stakeholders . The team then shared their respective BUs   business development ways of working and best practices . The surveys included process understanding ,   deliverables expectation , new model point of view and challenges . We documented all the details and   with some mapping of addressing common activities , categorization of standards & customized activities   and suggested additional requirements . 

 We then agreed on a common ways of model working and run for one proposal for each of the BUs . We   delivered the proposals within 6 weeks . We again conducted a brief surveys with all key stakeholders on   new model and the deliverables quality & timeliness . We discussed our own experiences , key learnings   and documented . 

 We then analyzed our proposal response time taken , utilization of resources and quality . 

 Insights 

 Our analysis from AS IS ways of working , TO BE ways of working and stakeholders feedback from   expectations and new mode experiment gave us some interesting new insights other than the hypotheses   we started . 

 To address our primary hypotheses , our result shows that ~70 % activities are common / standards across   the BUs but in new model environment we were able to achieve only ~30 % - 35 % optimization   leveraging   same tools & applications .   One of the reason for this difference is BU - wise stakeholder working in silos   with different expectation with no common platform / applications . 

 To address the difference a new ideas also evolved – introducing a common digital ( mobile enabled )   sharepoint with standard ways of working / content / best practices for easy access . 

 So we are now scaling the Shared Services model in phases and optimizing our teams . 

 <NAME> 

 Our next project is to test proposal management integrating with the Shared Service model . The primary   hypotheses will be it will further optimize the effort and led to enhance sales and other stakeholders ’   experience . We plan to leverage combination of design thinking tools of Learning Launch and Visualization   to test the tool and overall model . Visualization will be effective in creating how the tools GUI and   interface with stakeholder while <NAME> <NAME> can be used to test the overall model experiment with   the sales . 

"
"Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our customers , who are government agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their services to their customer , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens , businesses , and non- citizens . I have used the technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . 

 If appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous research , and discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage approach helps to reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the service . The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO , labor unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization operates . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual , either based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders , or another format . 

 For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic – especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem 

 space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide the values for the variables . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their work .

"REFLECTION – MIND MAPPING 

 Challenge & Selection 

 We are a well establish sales company in this region , covering direct and indirect / using   distributors sales channels . Supplying to industrial market . With INNOVATION mindset our   business began to look upon SOLUTION SELLING , new sales strategy ignited to affirm business   footage . Think out of the box . 

 Solution selling need a strong engagement with customers to understand their pains and need   in order to prescribe the right remedies to solve their problems and need . To make customer   confidence with our products , service and commitment . 

 COVID-19 pandemic outbreak which resulted in many businesses suffering business activity   constraints .   Our business is not rule out either . To meet project commissioning requirement .   Meeting up with stakeholder and contractor at each project stage is a challenge during this lock   down . 

 Business principle , project timeline can not be compromised . 

 In time like this , an ad - hoc project team was quickly form consisting of marketing , technical , IT   and operations to review and resolve the current grid lock . Several team members have   completed design thinking and I am lucky together with the team to be able to quickly apply what   we have learned . 

 We agreed to adopt the Mind Mapping Tool to unlock the uncertainty and unknown conditions ,   mapping out the four stages of “ what is ” , “ what if ” , “ what wows ” and “ what works ” – to Empathize ,   Defiine problem , Ideate a solution , Develop & Test . 

 Application 

 “ how to deliver the project on time ” . Design thinking is <NAME> <NAME> , more of a way to   continuously evolve your thinking and respond to meet customer ’s needs . A sub - group started   several discussion sessions with the programmer , contractor and end - user to only realized an   even bigger problems beside meeting the project date line surface . We failed to see initially ,   what about carrying out the project commissioning , physical installation and provide training for   end - users without physical and face - to - face interaction , which is the major challenges during   this lock down period . 

 Having identify the ‘ what is ’ , we proceeded to the next stage of ‘ what if ’ . Various possible   solutions were quickly listed , like – power - point presentations , video conferencing , training video   clips , webinar are the many options considered . 

 We organized and mapped out our understanding on the board to arrive our next level of decision     on “ what wows ? ” – LIVE WEBINAR to touch base on the step - by - step installation procedures ,   complemented with video clip on the FAT procedures and an end - users training module . 

 We first test run on the newly developed end - user training module with a smaller group of internal   and external stakeholders , which had received sound feedback to further improve and make the   training more comprehensive . 

 Our team are confidence with the solution proposed and looking forward to implements ‘ what   works ’ soon . 

 Insight & Approach 

 It is a blessing that our team members had underwent the design thinking training which have   enriched our mindset to be able to react to underlying issues which we failed to see initially and   can quickly come out with alternative solution to address the problem . 

 While “ what wows ” is on trial .   It is crucial to confirm or fine - tune the perceived solution based   on “ customer ” needs . The team is very positive and certain to be able to roll out - ‘ what works ’ 

 This solution will become another future training methodology option , using LIVE WEBINAR to   reach out fast and to wide scope of audience for marketing products launch or training .

"Reflection - Visualization 

 Challenge 

 From time to time I have to engage family members and friends to certain vacation 

 tours .   Many often they are not familiar with and even have no idea on the cities or 

 places which I am persuading them to visit .   To allow them to imagine and feel that 

 the cities or places are nice to visit , visualization is a useful tool I have chosen to use . 

 Selection 

 Vacation tours often involve sight - seeing , joining traditional or local festive events , 

 having nice meals , etc .   We all know that the best part of all these activities are 

 words alone can not describe them good enough .   Visualization of the situation 

 would provide them with a much better understanding . 

 Application 

 I started by showing them the city to be visited on google map , so that they can 

 easily visualize whether we are flying to the other side of the earth or just travelling a 

 short distance just across the border . 

 I showed pictures of how people at that place dress outdoor during the season we 

 are travelling instead of simply telling them that the weather is going to be hot in the 

 afternoon , drizzles in the evening etc . 

 The itinerary is displayed in a flow diagram while each stop will be supplemented 

 with pictures showing what the place is like .   And pictures of food and restaurants 

 will also allow them to visualize how certain dishes look like . 

 Insight 

 Visualization is all about images .   Applying it to an itinerary will provide a much 

 better understanding .   Possibility of having different expectation within the group is 

 thus minimized . 

 Approach 

 I learned from visualization do provide a focal point of discussion and align our 

 understanding of a certain information among the group .   It is most useful in 

 situation where the discussion topic are abstract or difficult to explain or maybe 

 words itself are n’t good enough for explanation , for example – discussion on how to 

 decorate your new home . 

"
"Challenge&Selection 

 As a beginning , the tool I have chosen is Visualization to create a visual experience for the audience   to clear the storytelling . The subject is to give information about a start - up and the process of buying   a product from the website of the company . Name of the company is BBC and they asked for a   simple and clear reflection of the process to expand the target audience and be understandable by   different ages . Company sells bags which has a wide range of models and customers . Process of   selling is explained in detail at the presentation with the help of slide shows and animations . 

 Application 

 To begin with , two simple symbols have been used to create a symbol of a customer : a circle for the   head , and a triangle for the body , to reflect a simple approach even at the beginning . Then , the   adventure of buying the product starts , entering the website , choosing the product that the   customer wants to buy , and buying the product by being directed to the online purchase system .   After this story finishes , other possibilities as to change of return the product would be mentioned   and the same customer model is seen as doing and completing these processes . 

 By making customer model anonymous and without gender , each audience from different gender ,   age or social status can find something that can be connected to the symbol , and they may   remember what do to in case they have a problem . Making the narration both verbal , auditory and   visual way consolidates the understanding and appeals to each audience in the presentation . With   the usage of using of different colors and symbolizing the process with a continuous line which may   be zoomed in and out during the presentation in narrating different stages , can support the   presentation and build a connection between the narrator and the presentation . 

 To involve the audience to the presentation , after explaining how to order from the website , I would   tell that there are our colleagues in each row of the saloon and they may help them if they have any   further questions about the system . I will give them 15 minutes and ask them to order a piece from   the website which will be free for them . With doing that , each participant may understand how to   manage the website and the ordering system with the feeling of “ must ” because the product will be   priceless for them . Also with the involvement of participants , the company may understand the weak   sides of the system and work on and improve that sides more . 

 Insight&Approach 

 What I have learned from finishing this exercise is how to lead and address to different kind or types   of people and how to grab their attention . By finding a common understanding and a feeling as an   object being “ free ” , each participant would be involved or has to learn the system and they may   spread the system all over their social environment . With doing that , the company may have a loss in   short time , but after having the positive results , the product will be spread all over the target .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I work as a Business Analyst in a vendor company which develop Loan System ( retail/ corporate banking   system ) for Bank . Developer had built the base system since 10 years ago and some bank are using that   system since 10 years ago . Hence , our challenge is to improve the existing system workflow and build a   new workflow if new bank policy or new product launch from time to time . The improving of system   workflow will improve the bank officers ( users ) working turnaround time , hence , bank officers can work   more efficiency and this will help to increase their KPI as well as the banking products sale . What is   banking products ? For Loan Origination System , the example of banking product will be Mortgage Loan ,   Credit Card , Car Loan , Personal Loan and etc . What is system workflow ? The workflow is the activities/   stages that bank officers do for loan application . For example , from data entry  loan amount   recommendation    approve loan amount  documentation  disbursement of loan amount . 

 Selection 

 Loan system involve many group of users , eg . sale team , processing officer , recommended officer ,   approving officer , disbursement officer , and etc . Each group of user have different task , different   process , and different requirement . In order let all the users have a clear and better understanding of   the existing and “ to - be ” system workflow , we choose Visualization tools . It is a tools that help us on   identifying the problem , discuss problem with different group of users , organizing the existing flow and   “ to - be ” flow and present the flow to our users . 

 Application 

 To improve the existing system workflow , we would like to identifying and understanding the problem   of existing system . The first thing we do is to use <NAME> to draw the existing system workflow by using the   Process Flow Diagram based on the previous document and the current system behavior . This is because   the existing document is not updated when there is small enhancement on the system workflow from   time to time . 

 After that , we conduct an interview session with different group of users on the system experience and   their comments on the existing system . For this activity , around 3 - 4 participants to represent one group .   Example , 3 person from sales team , 3 person from recommendation officer and etc . Besides , we used   the ethnographic approach which is <NAME> <NAME> tool . We stepped in to their office ( different   department for different group of users ) , follow users and observe the whole banking loan process . 

 From the existing process flow , interviewing , and observation , we found that , many customer apply   credit card during roadshow , and customer need to fill in the physical application form . Sale person only 

 create application in the Loan System after they go back to office . It is not convenient and use lot of time   to create the application one by one and fill in all the data from physical application form to Loan   System . Besides , for example housing loan , some of the customer would like to apply loan from   different bank and check the interest rate that bank provide , hence , customers possible to request users    to cancel and reactivate the application in the Loan System again and again . 

 After gather all this information , we propose to build an android and IOS version loan app that can   integrate to the existing Loan system . Hence , sales team able to let customer fill in the loan application   form via the tablet / ipad during the roadshow . Hence , it reduce the burden of sales person , so that sales   person no need to go back office and create the application in desktop . Besides , we enhance the flow by   including the cancel - reactivate and reject - reinstate process . To present the “ to - be ” flow , we draw a “ to- be ” Process Flow Diagram . We present it to different group of users in the same meeting . Through the   process visualization , they have a clear and better understanding of the “ to - be ” system workflow and   the differences of existing and “ to - be ” process . Based on the new flow they provide their concern and   ideas . 

 Insight 

 Visualization of Process Flow Diagram chart is prefect as to define the problem and from there , we   analyze the existing solution and optimize it . As this is a large system , we found that we able to translate   the complicated workflow into a Detail Process Flow Diagram . Since it is large system and involve many   group of users , Detail Process Flow Diagram is better than a high level Process Flow Diagram . Different   action selected by different group of users able to route the application to different post - stages / flow .   Then the user assigned to that post stages will proceed the necessary action . Example , from Simple Data   Entry stage , users can route application to Pending Recommendation Stage , then the Recommendation   Officer who assigned to handle the application will do the necessary checking , recommend the loan   amount , and route the application to Pending Approval stage for Approving Officer . All these can be   done by the Detail Process Flow Diagram . Users able to have an overall view on how the system work .   When we discuss and present the “ to - be ” Detail Process Flow Diagram , users able to understand the   whole process and help to point out the unnecessary steps or gaps and we can improve that . 

 <NAME> 

 Given that the Loan System include many groups of users and different group of user need to handle   different process , hence , the visualization via Detail Process Flow Diagram is the appropriate tool . As   previous mentioned , we able to translate the complicated Loan system flow into Process Flow Diagram .   From there , we check what the existing problem is . Besides , we also found the current issue via   interviewing , and observation in the real working environment . After that , we present our propose   solution via the Detail Process Flow Diagram . We can discuss and review the flow together with different   group of user and improve the flow to remove the unnecessary steps or gaps after discussion . We will   then provide the details functional specification and develop the system based on the new <NAME> 

 Process Flow Diagram once everything confirmed and agreed . In future , we will still use this visualization   tools to design those complicated system .

"Storytelling 

 Promotion & Staying at the top , gracefully . 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is the tool I always use when I need to provide context , perspective , motivation , and gain   support from my team for an important project . Over my career I had several bosses who were very   astute in connecting a real - business life challenge we were facing at a moment - i.e. , a competitive   process to expand our businesses internationally or a bid to sell energy to a high - profile customer in   <ADDRESS> - to a successful ( most of the time ) story they had already lived , sometimes even in their personal   lives . “ The talk ” used to happen at the beginning of projects , usually in our kick - off meetings , was part of   the initial presentation and was led by the CDO ( Chief Development Officer ) or event the CEO depending   on the scope of the project . We used to refer to them as anecdotes . The fact that these stories were   real , conveyed a concrete sense of resilience by the people who were in them and were lived by our   leaders in each case helped us a lot down the road to reconfigure during several setbacks , preserve our   motivation and moral and restore our desire to win . 

 Application 

 The most challenging period of my career started in January 2014 with a promotion and took me almost   4 years . And the example I would like to briefly describe is how storytelling ( regarding my career and   personal challenges ) helped me accept this promotion and start this new role with the support of the   existing team . In January 2014 there was a major restructuring in my firm and almost all the executive   directors were replaced . The new CEO asked me to leave Business Development - as the agenda would   be less on the growth side and more on managing JVs – to become the Superintendent of power trading   ( free market ) and commercialization ( regulated market ) , a bigger team which would give me the first   P&L responsibility . My first challenge : the former superintendent , a very charismatic executive , was   asked to step down as they wanted someone more focused on finance and processes . My second   challenge : I had no formal experience in trading although my master ’s in finance and business   development experience gave me the confidence to accept the promotion . My third challenge : lead   senior managers , people who had been working for 15 - 20 years with the same subjects . So , the   question was really about the three elements of trust and how I could first assemble them in a   storytelling I delivered to the team during my first week : 

 1 . Would I be able to maintain / foster an atmosphere of positive relationships ( or camaraderie , a 

 “ trademark ” of my predecessor ? ) The implicit concern here was : “ am I going to be fired as well ” or   “ is there a mandate to restructure the team ” ? What I could tell them in first place was that I was   given autonomy to lead the team and the business , and this was the only way it could work for me :   full responsibility for results and lack of results as well as always . Having said this meant that I had   the green light for changes if believed they were necessary , but I was not given any script   beforehand . I believed that I could foster an incredibly positive , constructive atmosphere and   progress even further on fronts like team development ( technical and behavioural ) , business   fluency and better relationship between the team based In <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> and <ADDRESS> de <ADDRESS> . I told   them I had taught children math and computer science in different occasions in my life so as a non- trained professor I liked very much to transfer my business knowledge to the team as well . In   addition to this , I encouraged them to speak with my previous teams to learn their perspective as   well . 

 2 . Would I be able to quickly transfer my previous knowledge / expertise to trading and 

 commercialization ? I believed this was the smoothest point to address . I was not a specialist at all   in any sector – my focus was on business and its fundamentals and my career at that time was   developed in 4 blocks - chemical and petrochemical , metals and mining , management consulting   and power - with different companies and corporate cultures . From telling them how I could   transition from all these spaces , the belief I had that by holding on to fundamental business   concepts and practices one can apply those in different sectors , and the benefits to me as an 

 individual from transitioning from time to time , I attracted their curiosity for subsequent individual   meetings to address their development goals or even more conceptual career questions – it was an   interesting journey specially with the younger team members . 

 3 . Did I walk my talk ? Was I consistent , did I honour commitments and keep promises ? Although 

 they could also obtain elements to judge this aspect from other colleagues , this one was more   personal in my opinion and would be constructed day - by - day , by their observation . I mentioned to   them that back in 2007 when I joined the firm , I told my first team that whenever they were offered   a better career opportunity even within our firm , I would support them to pursue their objective . I   shared with them something that happened to me and made me thing this way : when I was   working for a mining company in 2010 , I was also studying for my master´s in finance . I was part of   the business development team when an opportunity with the treasury team appeared . My boss   did not support me because he believed it would have sound bad for him to lose someone for a   neighbour department . It was difficult for me at that time and I never would have liked to provide   the same negative experience to someone in my team . 

 Insight & Approach 

 On my first week I addressed the three points above in three different occasions : first meeting with the   whole team , second meeting with managers only and third meeting with the whole team again and   more structured in which I presented to them the initial findings , areas of concern and how we could   cooperate during the first 3 months when we would reconvene and evaluate our progress . 

 I believe the stories I told them to illustrate our areas of concern stayed with them on the background   over the years we worked together . Everyday I sensed that we have an opportunity to build this fabric   called trust . The stories were on their minds and they kept checking whether the persona on that   anecdote corresponds to the one in front of them , today . Although my example was not an objective   one to reach a physical , concrete product ( a system , a car , or an app ) , it led us as to the fantastic   product that is a team to function in harmony and in a transparent way .

"Design Thinking Assignment -Reflection : 

 I used the Learning Launch tool for analysis on the challenge . 

 Challenge :   fitness here is a   startup fitness company providing holistic fitness services from <ADDRESS> and   meditation to cardio and strength and group sessions like Zumba , <ADDRESS> etc . The company was doing   very well and with increased footfall , even acquired real estate to cater to local community needs . As   <NAME> battered the world and   with increasing restrictions and safety consideration , going online was   to become the new norm to sustain and grow , Fitness here was charged with   task of taking its model   online in which it had no experience as it had always been brick and mortar startup that boasts of state   of art facilities . 

 Tool : The tool selected is the learning launcher because this is a new business that fitness here s   launching into and they were not sure how people are going to embrace the new norm or reality .   Planning everything upfront and launching on grand scale will take time which the company can not   afford as it might lead to loss of customers and brand image impacting negatively for its inability to   innovate and thrive in changed market conditions As a result ,   a quick launch with basic features was   needed to see and learn how users   embrace it and build for change based on feedback . 

 Application : 

 Initially a basic feature of the app was launched after notifying the customers of change in way of   functioning and offering them chance to continue their bookings from the app and workout from home .   The initial resistance were there as customers cited issues with not being tech savvy , not favorable   home conditions to workout , lack of “ personal   or coach ”    experience .Some of them(fitness   enthusiasts )   signed up anyways to explore what will be in store . Initially we offered a “ 14 day ” free trial   for all new users(non members ) so that they can test the application and see if it works for them . They   were instructions   by support team in downloading app , registering and signing up of class , This took   time though but around 70 %   people did mention they got the hang of signing up and booking class . The   users gave suggestions like : 

 -Displaying visually the class details(e.g style of yoga or style of cardio(upper or lower or full body ) 

 -energy meter that displays energy and calories burnt and report generated 

 -ability to book multiple class 

 -trainer details 

 The feedback was excellent and collated amongst our strategy and data team to improve upon the   feature . 86 % of   trial members converted to full membership and 71 % existing members renewed   existing membership and we got another 23 % increased members who signed up for app 

 We introduced updates to the app in short durations ( 10 days ) on the below : 

 -class details including do and do n’t and the advantages of doing   the class 

 -energy tracker and timer introduced 

 -ability to take pic after workout and share achievement to earn badge 

 The feedback was excellent , and it helped us to add additional features in the subsequent app    releases   like : 

 quick demo(1 min )   of each class 

 -report of   classes   taken and progress 

 -rating trainer 

 Overall ,   applying design thinking was amazing for our company and business as it helped us to grow in   online market and tap into other   regions of world as well like <ADDRESS> , US , <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . Though we had   a good team that we can pride ourselves and count on , we quickly got out thinking cap and applied app   techniques like brainstorm , creating vision , rough mind map , story telling and did some prototype to   substantiate our idea and believed we can deliver a valuable service to customer which worked . 

 Insight : 

 We did discover that the initial resistance was due to   customer perceived notions of not being able to   workout from home and their apprehensions due to their bad experiences in having tried out such apps   or not savvy to use technology .But as they were coached on the usage , their level of involvement   increased and they could see potential benefit like saving time ,   booking for classes at their fingertips ,   keep track of user journey and progress indicator like calories burnt , energy level etc . 

 We discovered that customers were happy when we offered this on trial which helped them to play   around   with app . In addition , the price had to be scaled down which worked on many people signing up   also . 

 Approach : 

 Next time , I will use same tool as   we realized the benefit of the current one and add some better   techniques like survey to see how comfortable people are to use online way of working and have them   generate ideas by giving options on form ( emailed or have them fill out in person ) . This will have them   and us be prepared to roll out app and for them to better be prepared on what to expect   considering   new normal .

"Smart Cart 

 Smart Cart is a shopping friendly idea . What if you are    stuck in a queue at a shopping mall and you are getting    late for a movie , for all these problems one solution is    SMART CART . 

 How it Works ? 

 Smart Cart is a device which has its own barcode    scanner and lid to cover the cart . Once you scan the    barcode that ’s present on the item you bought the lid    opens and you can place the items in it . If you want to    forcely open the lid it gives a warning message at the    counter . All the items price you scanned will go to the    counter . The counter number is present on screen of the    Smart Cart . 

 Tech Used in It 

 The Smart Cart is mainly based on bluetooth connection    between the cart and the system present at the counter .    The barcode that you scan on the item will get received    by the system in fraction of seconds by the bluetooth    connection between those two devices . The sensors    present in the cart will make sure to not open the lid    until the barcode gets scanned . So no one can cheat itAt    the end the lid will be opened by the seller using a key    so that all the items will be safe and it is profitable for    both customer and seller 

 Application 

 The first main use of the smart cart is anti theft . The time    that you spend by standing at the queue in the mall will    get saved as the data of the products that you buy will    be received to the seller at the time you place in the cart .    It increases the social distance and there is no need to    get vexed up by standing in a queue . It reduces the use    of ecommerce and gives profit to malls .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge and Selection   As I enrolled to the online course of Design Thinking for Innovation , I was briefed about four tools   used in the design thinking process that could aid in development of innovative products and   services . And these four tools were : Visualization tool , <NAME> telling tool , <NAME> mapping tool , and   Learning launch tool . The good thing about these tools are , that they can be used to solve any   problem and are not just restricted to one domain or industry . And hence these can be called as   universal problem - solving tools . 

 Going further , I wish to reflect on my experiences using the Visualization tool in product   development . Me and my group of friends had freshly graduated and were fascinated by the things   happening in the electric vehicle ( EV ) space across the world and in <ADDRESS> . There were too many EV   start - ups mushrooming in <ADDRESS> , the IT capital of <ADDRESS> . We wanted to study if we could use our   expertise in automobile and electrical engineering to get onto this bandwagon . 

 Application   As fresh graduates , we lacked the domain expertise in the EV field as most of our curriculum was   related to Internal Combustion ( IC ) engines and related components . So , the first thing that we did   was to research about the heart and soul of an EV , the motor and the batteries . We contacted a few   start - ups , watched a YouTube videos on EVs , read books on electronics and electricals , understood   about batteries and their nature at different temperatures . And collated all the necessary data into a   file on Google drive which was always accessible to everyone anytime . 

 When we met to discuss , we would use simple tools such as stick figures , arrows , and basic   geometrical figures to make each other understand the complexities involved and made sure we   were on the same page .   Most of the time pen and paper was used to visualise the intricacies and   not any complicated design or animation software . We used storyboards to understand the various   requirements at different stages to potential customers . 

 After completing the exercise of narrowing down on the motor and the battery along with a suitable   Battery Management System ( BMS ) we moved ahead with the next task of designing the actual   motorcycle . We considered various market trends , used pictures of various EV motorcycles as well as   concept motorcycles from various manufacturers as reference pictures and decided to design our   own motorcycle with “ Futuristic ” as the design theme . 

 Post completion of multiple iterations to the design of the motorcycle , which involved numerous   meetings and discussions to envision the motorcycle , we did a complete cost analysis to produce a   thousand electric motorcycles a year . This analysis made us realise the requirements of funds and   resources involved in manufacturing the motorcycle which was not very feasible financially . 

 After all this , the team decided not to pursue the manufacturing of the motorcycle as the market   was not mature enough and the EV manufacturers in the two - wheeler segment had not turned any   profit even after years of operation . And the detailed plan is still awaiting to be revived once the   market conditions favour the purpose and vision of the team . 

 And yes , this is how me and my friends used design thinking without knowing what design thinking is   to develop the futuristic electric motorcycle . 

 Insight and <NAME>   And now , after completing the Design Thinking for Innovation course , I feel that I am equipped with   the right knowledge which could help me in avoiding group think and visualise the problem   scenarios with probable solutions to tackle problems in shorter time . 

 The major take away of using the visualization tool is that we can just use simpler tools such as a   whiteboard and marker pen or just a paper and pencil to communicate with our peers to make sure   the ideas and the explanations are better understood by everyone without using expensive and   fancy software .

"Assignment 

 Increasing University Admissions 

 Challenge : 

 The challenge at hand is to increase the number of applicants applying for   admission at this University this year . I am a part of a 5 membered team which   looks after the admissions and recruitments department . Keeping the current   COVID-19 situation and it ’s economic impacts in mind , it will not be easy for many   students to apply to universities therefore we will have to redesign our marketing   tactics to sustain the universities expenses amid increasing inflation by increasing   the number of upcoming students . 

 Selection : 

 Keeping the challenge in mind and after very careful consideration of the tools   available to us , our team has mutually decided on the “ Learning Launch ” tool .   Learning Launch fits perfectly for our situation because <NAME> <NAME> basically   means fast and cheap experiments . Due to the time constraint and a specific   budget allocated , learning launch will do just fine . 

 Application : 

 For the first learning launch , we decided to completely redesign our scholarship   program . As we wanted quick and inexpensive experiments , the University   officials approved and had liked it very much . The new Scholarship Program   introduced comprises of 50 reserved seats for 100 % Scholarship , 40 seats   reserved for up to 80 % scholarship , and 50 seats reserved for 30 % till 60 %   scholarships . And on top of that , all scholarships awarded will be either on merit   basis or on need basis . This program turned out be a total success as the number   of students applied for admissions increased by 30 % and those 30 % candidates   applied for a scholarship . 

 The second <NAME> <NAME> , we focused on was reinvesting the capital . Since the   university is currently closed due to the current pandemic situation , a lot of   money is saved on the utility bills . By investing that money into social media   marketing and maintaining a strong social media presence using the learning   launch tool , it can be very insightful and efficient . After successful implementation   of the tool , it was seen that most high school students who were interested in   getting an admission at the university were more from the Instagram and   Facebook campaign and less from the <ADDRESS> and twitter campaign . After a   careful consideration these results , the second part of the campaign was only   launched on Facebook and Instagram with capital reinvested in these two   platforms instead of the other two . 

 Insight : 

 In this current situation , learning launch was the ideal tool to apply as our team   needed to try and test out new ideas and see if they would work . We created a   hypothesis and then tested on it not keeping in mind the we would most   necessarily be succeeding in it because learning launch is all about try and testing   ideas , fast and cheap whether or not it meant success . 

 Approach : 

 Given the same tools next time , me and team would still go for Learning Launch .   Firstly because we needed quick and affordable experiments therefore learning   launch gives us that opportunity . Secondly we wanted to the reflect insight gained   and for that once again learning launch is the best alternative .

"Zero to a Patent : A Launch Learning Story 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As part of my Chemical Engineering undergraduate program , I participated in a year long   research adventure that consisted in developing a self - heating patch that could rapidly   increase its temperature and last longer than those available in the market . Although many   versions already existed , the available products lacked the complete set of prerequisites we   were looking for . 

 At ﬁrst our research seemed straight forward . There was information , data , and analytics   readily available that helped us narrow down our product options from the start . We had the   materials , patch shape and list of experiments we wanted to run before building an initial   prototype . Our ﬁrst mistake was exactly that , a lengthy list of assumptions and no prototype .   We started our research based on an initial list , which only yielded poor results . 

 This is where the Launch Learning technique came into the picture . By using Launch Learning   and continuously use it to build prototypes , we were able to hypothesize , test and implement   solutions to validate our ideas . 

 Application 

 When the Launch Learning process began , we focused on execution . The ﬁrst idea we tested   was the heart of the product , the chemicals . We tried new combinations of chemicals that we   thought could still get us to the required temperature . After trying a couple of options , one   ﬁnally worked . This validated our theory that there were many ways to generate heat using   diﬀerent products from those originally prescribed . Then , we chose the composition of   materials that reached the desired temperature . This ﬁrst outcome conﬁrmed that Launch   Learning worked and that we should continue to apply it to further reﬁne our product . 

 Even though we had successfully chosen the base chemicals , we still could not get the heat to   last as long as we needed it to . Therefore , we decided to focus on a new idea ; changing the   structure . We created multiple prototypes to determine how structure impacted the   performance of the product . The prototypes had various geometric ﬁgures and sizes to ensure   a comprehensive evaluation . The tests proved that shape indeed inﬂuenced how heat was   transmitted and how it limited the speed . In the end , we were able to select the most optimal   structure for our product . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Results speak . We were able to develop a new product that surpassed market standards and   patent it . In hindsight , we would have saved a lot of time if we had leveraged <NAME> <NAME>   earlier instead of leaning so heavily on our original assumptions . We thought data was going to   be our ally , but instead it limited ourselves to think narrowly . 

 In this scenario , the Launch Learning technique is appropriate and necessary . In other   instances we could run multiple experiments in parallel to test ideas of diﬀerent nature ( e.g. ,   Prototype A testing chemicals and Prototype B testing structure ) instead of executing them   sequentially . That way we can validate multiple theories simultaneously and then review the   outcomes , gain insight and use this new information to create products that are much closer to   the desired solution . 

 Applying Launch Learning strategies saves time . We focused on testing small changes to yield   fast results and pivoted our ideas as we disproved concepts . By changing our mentality and   approach , our team learned how to tackle similar issues in other projects . In fact , it continues   to impact the way that I personally tackle problems today . Even though I work in a corporate   environment , I believe the best outcomes have been achieved by launching products in a   smaller scale and proving if they indeed satisfy our clients ’ needs .

"Reflection – Learning Launch     Challenge     Our design team received a consulting project from a client , a Federal government body that   performs assessment and accreditations of higher education institutions . The client has   empanelled partners to assist them in this process .    The project was scheduled for 30 days . Our team , comprising of 4 members , were tasked to   improve the efficiency of the assessment process by developing a prototype of an alerting   system that would help in real time status tracking of applications to track the status of their   partners work and also reduce time delays in the overall process of accreditation . My design   team had prior experience in working on process improvement projects , henceforth , the task   of gathering information / requirements from the client became quicker .      Selection     Our design team was known for its agility and came up with a quick design prototype of the   tracking system using software tools . Now it was time for the team to use learning launch tool   to test the developed prototype of the alerting system . This learning launch tool will help in   validating the assumptions made during the development of the prototype .      Learning launch tool assists in figuring out what customer needs are in a quick way . Most   learning launches involves reaching out to the customers to gather their feedback .     My team was well aware of the use of learning launch tool which is an experiment meant to   quickly test an idea and prototype them . The Alerting System prototype had to be tested with   the clients sooner to get their feedback .      <URL>   <URL>       Application     During the learning launch phase 1 , our design team followed agile methods to develop a   prototype of the alerting system . Agile methods are popular for small incremental work . The   agile method that my team followed included phases such as scoping , diagrams for initial   sprint , development and testing .    During the learning launch phase 2 , the developed alerting system was released in   production . A set of Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) experts on the client   team were asked to use the newly deployed alerting system to track their applications in real   time . Our design team sent out a questionnaire to this ICT team and tasked the experts to fill   it up . ICT team was given a day to fill out their feedback on the alerting system . This   questionnaire focused on the usage of the alerting system and any other features that needed   to be incorporated . The project was completed within 28 days as per the scope set in the   initial discussion . 

 Insight     Using learning launch tool really helped our design team as the assumptions that were made   during the requirements gathering phase were validated . There were couple of changes that   were suggested by the ICT team from the <ADDRESS> side and those were documented in their   feedback . The challenge that team faced was that , if the changes needed to be incorporated   in the newly developed alerting system , then the scope of the project would expand and also   the time line would get extended . So , the design team decided to hold a project extension   meeting with the client and presented a Phase 2 project proposal . This proposal is still under   approval status .      Approach     Learning Launch proved to be a very effective tool in order to know whether the assumptions   of our design team were accurate . At times , the design team had missed few requirements   that were identified and incorporated as the team followed agile iterative process . Combining   the usage of learning launch tool and agile methodology made our team successful in keeping   up with the project timelines that eventually made our client happy .

"Reflection – mind mapping 

 <ADDRESS> and selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of mind mapping , to achieve a shared understanding of a 

 problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and 

 define possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach to know more about my 

 product or my design . So , later on when I present my design , I truly know the elements the 

 target market , the tools , the plus and minus , and everything . Mind mapping is one of the 

 most powerful tools in the design thinker 's toolbox . It 's used to look for patterns , it 's used to 

 look for insights , that lead to more creative solution to my challenge . Mind mapping is 

 looking for patterns and insights in a large quantity of data you collected during your 

 exploration of what is the current reality . The goal is to establish criteria for the what - if idea 

 generation phase . Which comes next . This phase is pivotal in the design thinking process . 

 Mind mapping provides a way from what is to what if . 

 Application 

 I apply this just right how it should be . First I take a look at the current reality . I found out 

 and of course analyzing the what is , what if , what wows , what works . Also the mix and 

 match about my idea and the current needs In reality keep working . I also apply the mind 

 set of think , make , break , and repeat . Mind mapping is an engaging alternative to that giant 

 report we might otherwise have written to sum up and communicate in prose and charts 

 and spreadsheets . All that your team uncovered . And we have to hope that somebody read 

 the giant report that we generated . Mind mapping is more intuitive . It 's more creative . It 's 

 more visual , and it 's more engaging . 

 After done with analyzing , I started to develop my ideas , fix or add things that previously not 

 good yet , so my ideas can be more realistic and match with everybody needs , or at least 

 with my segmented customer needs . After all , these process of course will take time and 

 cause a pros and cons with all the team . And last , I will present the final idea to the 

 stakeholders , we can categorize the stakeholder into some groups , and we can do kind of 

 interview , the simple one to help them giving us feedback that can improve the idea . 

 Insight and approach 

 What I gain , of course feedbacks . It really helps a lot for the idea improvement . That 

 feedbacks and also the mind mapping process work really efficient and prove to be 

 affective . This also effected how I think , and how I make my design . It helps looking more 

 slightly to detail , and somehow looking from different perspective . 

 And since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , 

 next time I would use the mind mapping activity as a starting point for a series of design 

 thinking activities . Then the revising the ideas will be easier .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 My organization deals with the production of plantain flour . Plantain flour is a staple food , where   plantain fruits are dried , grinded into flour and taken as meal . This flour can be used to replace a lot of   meals for people with certain ailments and generally anyone interested in having a change of diet . The   challenge is finding a way to get the plantain flour packs to the market , not just getting it to the market   only but having a high demand from customers . Aside running advertisement , a lot still felt out of place .   <NAME> , my objective is to capitalize on the health sector by providing plantain flour for people who due   to their ailment ( diabetes , hemorrhoids , low immune system and many more ) . This project will require   the company ’s resources with a maximum schedule of 2 months to uncover what we need to know   about our potential customers and our product . 

 Tool Selection 

 Naturally what comes to mind is to understand who my customers are and how my product brings   something different and effective to them . My team and I had to engage ourselves with a few customers   applying the Learning Launch tool to understand generally what our customers true need in other to   work hand in hand to solve this . 

 Application 

 Firstly , with the idea of having this alternative product delivered into the hands of people who fall into   the category as mentioned , my team and I only had what we know and needed more data as to why our   product is fit for distribution . We sought to find out what we do n’t know , by finding out possible places   where we can find a good number of customers to interview and test our products . As such was the   case , we came up with Health centre ’s , Hospitals , shopping malls and the local market . We decided   about 50 potential customers from different background and health conditions be interviewed and   given the product to try out . During the interviews , customers basic information like name , Age , Weight ,   Height , Body Mass Index , Contact Information were taken , we got to find out their day to day schedule ,   social life and how they maintain their health . Getting this information also came with the opportunity   of educating each and everyone of them on the benefits of plantain flour and this caught their interest . 

 This led to our second learning launch , this led to regrouping and understanding what exactly we were   dealing with . At this stage we were clear on what our audience of 50 potential customers needed . We   were able to track down the causes of each of their ailments be it natural causes or lifestyle causes ; all   this information was sorted out . 

 Insight 

 Our assumptions were identified and we went into action to test these assumptions . Basically , we   understood from our interaction that most of the potential customers had little or no idea about the   importance and usefulness of plantain , while some knew but would rather not go through the stress of   having to prepare the plantain flour for themselves . Next thing was to propose the idea of giving out the   product for trial and get results in the span of a month . On getting results from our potential customers   we took new data and compared to the initial data which we found considerable desired results and   customer satisfaction with our products . Some customers expressed concerns over some benefits which 

 were n’t achieved ( like possible weight loss ) during testing period and a few others but the team took   these concerns and will look over them with possible solutions incorporated into future launch design   processes . 

 Approach 

 The learning launch proved to be the appropriate tool , my team and I need to sit and look into the   insights gained and find possible solutions to future launch designs which should then have taken into   consideration the insights gained , what progress we were able to achieve and give a solution in order to   prepare our product for mass production and distribution .

"DESIGN THINKING WITH METHOD : LEARNING LAUNCH 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of my organizations in IT department , and my challenge is to help my distributor of my   organization for monitoring their sales transactions using software application in online ways , easier ,   can be access anytime and can be performed with the newest technology 

 Currently , our distributor have employee as administrator to setup master data that used in sales   transaction , example : salesman data , customer data , product data ,   route plan for sales ( example for   route plan : customer A will be visited by salesman 1A on Monday every week ) . The administrator use   application on computer ( not online ) , the have limitation in time and tools . 

 Our distributor also have salesman that used mobile application using <NAME> ( like PDA on the   picture below ) , the technology of the tool already obsolete and the tool size is too big 

 This project have some members include IT department , sales department and our distributor as the   end customer . This project limited to internal resource ( budget and employee time ) and will occur in   3 months . We will focus on trying to help our distributor have simple and newest software application   with the newest technology so it can be maintain easier 

 Selection 

 We use learning launch tool , because we can collect current problem , got new ideas and also make   prototype to testing 

 Application 

 For the first learning launch , we focused on what technology that can be applied to help our   distributor . Our IT programmer discuss with sales department   and we decide to use website to replace   computer application for administrator , so the administrator team can setup master data easier   example using mobile phone to open the website . For salesman , we decide to make android   application that can run on android mobile phone , we decide it because android mobile phone is use   by many people and the application can be download easier via google play store 

 For second learning launch , we focused on select feature on current application that already run well   and what feature that need to improve or fix ( if there is any error on current application ) . We   developed the feature with website and android technology . After we developed the prototype , we   test it with our distributor so they can try the new prototype and get their insight 

 Insight 

 By applying learning launch tool , our team identified what current problem and the best technology   to solve the problem . Additionally , we also got new insight from our distributor to add some new   feature in example : reporting application   to help our distributor got newest information like sales   trend datas on 6 months 

 Approach 

 Our team already select learning launch as design thinking tool , because with this method our team   can tested our application by giving it to the distributor , distributor can try the prototype and we can   get new insight . From two step learning launch , we combined the insight from our distributor and   develop new mobile application that fulfill their need

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Mind mapping is a great tool that which we tried with my client in order to   engage the management & the HOD ’s in fulfilling the objective of HR   department theme of ‘ Ownership ” , the organization was struggling with a   culture of ownership . The challenge was management & HOD ’s believed that   the employees needed to be more accountable & have ownership . As the   company consultant , we wanted to know what were the ideas of HOD ’s about   ownership since ownership moves from top to bottom and to make them work   on this which was a challenge . With ‘ what is ’ in mind and get to know ‘ what if ’ ,   we arranged an Ideation session inviting all the management and HOD ’s and   tried mind mapping as it ’s not a training session but helps to look for patterns   and themes in data . 

 Application 

 The participants were divided into teams and a team leader was assigned to each   team . Each team was given chart paper and a set of sketch pens and pad of   sticky notes each . They were given a word ownership which they had to write in   center and around that they had to draw other circles and draw images of what   were there ideas about it or what reflects as ownership culture . Few questions   were given to them in order to start there thinking process like why ownership   and what are the areas of impact and how can things be improved . Once teams   were done with their charts they had to move around to other charts and write   what could be done to get better on ownership on their individual sticky note   and paste it on another team ’s chart . Then teams came back to their respective   charts and discussed the suggestions given by teams . 

 Insight & Approach 

 It was time to turn observations into insights now for which we discussed each   chart in detail as the team leader presented and as a facilitator I asked the teams   ‘ so what ’ one or two times as the HR noted the good points which people had   come up with . Learning happened as way of a healthy discussion and   participants could gauge what was on mind of other HOD ’s . 

 So , with this mapping and suggestions by participants on what ideas could be   implemented to change organizational culture with the HR we later tried to look 

 for connections in suggestions by various teams . 

 This course and the mind mapping tool helped me to implement a new way to   gather data for designing further training interventions . Since this was the first   time I tried something like this it consumed more time than I thought . With this   experience in mind may be next time I can execute it in less time by being more   precise . 

 Next tool I plan to combine or try another tool for them is story telling since   they are already open to explore and know ‘ what is ’ and want to work out things   in their journey to ‘ what if ”

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I ’m the manager of a wellbeing collective that offers several activities around sports and physical   exercise from different disciplines , at an affordable cost and in a safety way , for people of different   ages in <ADDRESS> city . The objective is to promote healthy habits and body care , the latter as one of   the fundamental pillars in human health and wellbeing . Although activities are varied ( dance , yoga ,   running , biking , acrobatics , aerial silks , trekking , among others ) and most of them are inexpensive   or free , in the last six months the attendance of people dramatically diminished in comparison with   the first semester of the year , to the point where we had to cancel some of the scheduled activities   because no one signed up . So , the challenge is to find a strategy to maintain a high attendance of   people to the proposed activities over the next year . To achieve that , we identified two issues we   need to attend . The first one is to improve our convening power to impact new people . And the   second , to get people to stay motivated over time and constantly attend activities . 

 Selection 

 My team and I selected <NAME> <NAME> tool to address the challenge after going through a process   in which we studied the problem , interpreted the information , established the design criteria and   generated an idea . I quote <NAME> <NAME> : this tool is “ a small experiment that test your new   idea in the marketplace ” . As we saw in the explanations of the tool in the video conferences of the   course , we chose <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> because we wanted to test our idea in a real environment   or have a real experience with our users to confirm or refute a hypothesis that we built , in order to   improve and fully implement the idea in the future . Other reason was that is a fast cheap tool . We   had in mind to implement the strategy from the beginning of 2022 , so we had little time and money   to test it . 

 Application 

 We decided to focus in the people that already were part of the collective as our target audience   who we wanted to keep motivated . It ’s important to note that social media is our main diffusion   tool . The idea we developed -Goal(L ) Together- consists in three main steps : 1 ) Stablishing individual   objectives that can be monitored throughout the year related with the collective ’s offered activities ;   2 ) Allowing members to lead diffusion and convening processes in social media by inviting other   people to help them to follow up their goals ; 3 ) Sharing periodically their progress and reached goals   through short storytelling videos to motivate new people participate in the activities . 

 Our hypothesis was that the idea will improve both convening power part and motivation part .   Those three steps will give our members the motivation they needed to keep themselves engaged   and constantly attending to the activities by providing them a clear personal objective , a   responsibility , a follow up , and supporting feedback from the community . Not to mention the   satisfaction of being an agent of motivation for other people . In the other hand , it will help others 

 visualize what the collective do , with real human stories that could make people feel connected or   identified with . 

 So , we decided to carry out a one - week <NAME> <NAME> to invite members and new people to the   first meeting of the year : The Acroyoga Picnic . We selected 10 members to helps us with diffusion   and convening for the event and gave them access to our social media accounts . First day we had a   meeting with them in which we invited them to think about one objective they wanted to reach the   next year in the collective . They had to write it in a poster to hang in a visible place and to break the   objective down in a list of smaller achievable goals or tasks . Then , they were asked to take a little   step towards their objective each day during the rest of the week and do short videos sharing their   goals and progress in social media , and inviting people to help them keep going and to meet them   at the event . We gave them total creative freedom so they could do the videos as they wanted , but   they had to tell their own story and share at least one video per day . 

 To the end of the week , they told us how they felt about their progress , motivation , constancy and   discipline during the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . We also talked about how their close ones began to be   interested and how they received support from their families and friends . Also , some people began   to ask them about the event and the collective ’s activities . The feedback and interactions in social   media increased too . No doubt , a lot of funny creative inspirational material came out of this   experience . And finally , more new people than members attended the Acroyoga Picnic . Regardless ,   there were a greater number of participants than at last year 's event . 

 Insight 

 I think it was a really interesting exercise . We ’ve never done something like that before and we   realized that these feedback that came out of the Learning Launch were very helpful to elevate de   idea quality or effectiveness and to identify problems or gaps we had n’t seen yet . For example , after   the Learning Launch , we decided it was better that people could use also their own social media   accounts to share their stories so they could impact on those closest ones and also be able to reach   a wider and more diverse audience not limited to the collective ’s followers . Another relevant aspect   that emerged was to take into account member 's available time and their willingness to social media   activities . This made us see that it was a more complex challenge than we thought , and perhaps   with a better - defined scope we would have had more precise results . Overall , we learned the   importance of quick testing in the design thinking process to get better predictions and chances of   success with truly innovative ideas . 

 Approach 

 Although we could confirm our hypothesis in a short term , one of the issues we found was that the   results of the one - week <NAME> <NAME> did not give us enough information to predict the long- term people ’s behavior . We think it was because our understanding of our target audience ’s   unarticulated needs was very superficial , so was the solution . An alternative approach could be the   use of Ethnography tools , for instance , <NAME> tool and <NAME> <NAME> tool to make sure we   deeply understand our users ’ needs before we marry an idea .

"REFLECTION - VISUALIZATION 

 1 . CHALLENGE :   The challenge   is whenever I have an idea I failed to   explain it to my team members as the perspective in   which I see the the idea is not the same as the way they   see it there is a lot of miscommunication due to this I   was unable to express the idea and finally the product is   not executed properly     2 . SELECTION   I choose visualization as method as it helped me express   my views better to everyone and helped my teammates   understand my way of thinking      3 . Application   I used this to visualize the actual product which helped   me in better understanding of the project and explain it   better to the team with the help of this visualization by   using sketches and prototypes     4 . Insights   It allowed us to think in a nonlinear way as most of the   problems in real world are nonlinear it is useful for us     5 . Approach 

 I would like to apply this in my further sessions as well   as it gave me good results

"<ADDRESS> 

 Selection 

 I have been using Visualization within a co - creation project which aim was to « imagine the beauty of tomorrow ’s   nails » . It was a necessary tool as it was a team project and as we were working in a very short period of time ( 24h )   to create an innovation toward this subject and develop the pitch to present it . The team needed to go fast , to have   a common understanding of where we were going and of the proposition made by each member . It was like getting   inside one ’s head and getting aligned straight after visualizing the thought . 

 Application 

 Most of the time we were using drawing and sketching but we also used images from magazines to enrich and fasten   the use of the tool . For example we have designed a mobile phone application to choose a customized service in   which the customer were able to choose the service he wanted to receive , the colors of the nails he wanted to have   etc . In order to do this we have drawn the several steps of the application ’s interface . We got surprised to see that   we all orally agreed on what we were going to do , but sketching the application , we found that in fact there were   several points of view . We enriched our initial idea and made some choices but it was a great tool to share common   view and go deeper in the understanding of what we were imagining . 

 Insight 

 By vizualizing our prototype ( after long talk ) we found that a lot of steps and services were missing in the designed   solution . For example we did n’t have any way to geolocalize where the services was offered , so the customer   would n’t know where to go to receive it . That is why we have added a geolocalization page with the position of the   customer and the position of the nearest shops . At the end we also made an analogy with Uber services by adding   the possibility to give a grade to the service provider . 

 I think visualization can be strongly linked with prototyping ( maybe its lower form ) , it allows to think with our hand   or our eyes , to represent things in a very concrete way . By doing so we can save a lot of time in the understanding   on a common solution when sharing or co - building with others . It is also a strong tool to learn by doing . I would   say that it is a catalyst of the strength of cooperation and a powerful learning tool . 

 Approach     As visualization need to speak our mind and as we need to free our mind to be creative , I would use bigger spaces .   At one point our withe paper board began to be full , but we were willing to keep it to push forward our thinking . It   was not possible has our working space ( the room and the sheet of paper ) were not permitting expansion . We were   properly fencing ourselves , which did n’t allow a full use of the visualization .

"Mind mapping – a Design Sprint Approach 

 Challenge     I am a 02 years old product manager at a young startup . When I joined my company to replace   my predecessor , I took over a research and development department where the chaos was   king : no process , no organization , low confidence from most of the management , teams of   30 young ( mostly interns ) . Naturally delivering product making enter money on the bank   account of the company was the ultimate goal of my job . But there were also a lot of excellent   points : the company was not lacking resources , all the engineers were very talented , the   teams were following agile methodologies , and we had the ambition to push to the level of   industrial grade four products .     If I do not detail here the management part of my department , I think it is essential to frame   the story about the tools I chose to refine my products quickly .     Selection     To tackle the second challenges of creating great products I started to look for the most fitting   tool . When you look for things they start to pop from anywhere around you , and I add the   chance that one of my young engineers watch a video on YouTube about Google Design   Sprint . If you do not know Design Sprint , for me , they are in direct line with design thinking ,   but in a readier to use form . The big idea is to go through a whole design thinking process in   a five - day ( and step ) process : Understand , Diverge , Decide , Prototype and Validate . So , I   started to study the concept , and we quickly decided to go for a trial .     I the next section I will focus more my argumentation about the <ADDRESS> and Decide steps   of the Design Sprint as they are the one matching the Mind Mapping tool presented in this   course .     Application     So , we decided to do the first trial on a Design sprint . We gathered all the tools required , first   the easy ones : post - it , pens , whiteboards and meetings rooms . In second the human capital   was the most difficult to motivate , but I find a way to convince the COO to join us for the   Understand step and here the magic happens . The purpose of the understand step is to   represent the system you work on by listing on one side all the actors and mapping all the   action they do until they reach the desired output . Usually , you try to work on a specific   section or sector of the whole map . My COO took a pen and immediately started to draw on   a giant diagram on the windows we use as whiteboard modeling his entire business process   from A to Z , commenting and detailing each piece of information . The exercise was so great   that in a second step we hijack his teams who join us and completed the drawing accurately   by specifying few points .     We kept the diagram on the windows and continued the activity . We go through the diverge   step where we started to explore potential solutions to the problem individually using a mix   of researches and brainstorming , and finally , we arrive at the Decide step where you have to 

 vote for the best ideas . This point reminds me precisely what was described as a “ museum ”   in the course . On one wall was exposed the master piece of mapping from the COO and his   team . And on another one , a lot of small ideas , each of them like a paint trying to solve the   significant issues . After each participant pitched his ideas , you keep a moment to re - visit the   museum and start to vote for the best details of each idea .     Insight     The Understand and Decides step where enlightening for me from many points of view . I   profoundly believe this experience was one the most enriching one from a professional point   of view . It teaches me a tremendous quantity of things . First , you know nothing about the   people for who you are designing a product until you meet and interview them . Secondly , the   mind needs space to express his ideas in a precise manner . A piece of paper or a computer   screens are not adequate for such a task you need to spread information enough to be able   to physically step back from it or come close to get details . At least , when you work on a   problem , you must multiply the potential answer at an individual level but also as a group one   and try to do the sum of the best . It is at the price of this diversity of solution and exchange   that you achieve to find solution graded real innovations .     Approach     Next time I will need to apply such a tool I will do my best to keep in mind the lesson learned .   The diversity is a critical element in the team composition . Surfing on the success of the first   series of Design Sprint , I will do my best to include a better variety of profiles in the team ,   mixing : ages , gender , nationality , jobs , and positions in the company . The purpose will be to   get the best quality of output in the diverge and decide steps .     To be honest , the mind mapping part with its museum is already quite good and can be only   refined again and again until its execution is smooth . Sometimes , we get stuck in the   modelization of the process , or we miss few inputs , but we always figure out a quick way to   find the information we are looking for .     If you are curious about the methodology , I invite you to complete this course by doing extra   research on the Design Sprint .

"LEARNING LAUNCH 

 <NAME> and selection 

 As I am a student of food processing and technology , there are many challenges that came across while   designing a food product as well as selling or marketing a food product . One challenge that I was facing   was to select an idea that customers would appreciate and get comfortable with it . As I have failed in   some previous ideas . For that purpose , learning launch was a great and appropriate tool to test the idea .   It teaches to test an experiment very creatively . If the idea gets a success , its well and good and if it does n’t   then to improvise it or to develop a new idea . As IBM did the same as discussed in lecture . 

 Applications 

 Learning launch is a beneficial and helpful tool to simplify or neglect the challenges that come across while   doing different projects . I was trying to produce my own food product and I was not sure that whether it   will work or not ?   For that matter , I preferred Learning launch tool by inviting a few dozens of people for   an open feedback session . I had a conversation over the product about their feedbacks and came out to   be quite helpful . I got to connect with people(customers ) , learning the views and to improvise my   mistakes . 

 Insight 

 After the conversation in open feedback session , I got to know about the insight I was facing . The main   reason that I was facing failure in my previous endeavors was , having a miscommunication with the   thoughts of customers . What actually they require as a perfect product ? 

 With the open feedback session , I was able to overcome the problem that I was facing in those days . I got   to know that there should be a healthy and time to time conversation with the customers for better   growth and development of a product . 

 Approach 

 As I have got the insight about my failures and I recovered with the help of learning launch tool , which I   now practice regularly . The other tool , which is mind mapping , is also a fabulous one which I will use in   my future projects to find the shortcomings that I will face in finding relevant information about a    product . The tool helps to find the interconnections about the facts and data . And helps to collect   information relevant , related to the insights that may arise . Design thinking tools helps to solve the   problem more precisely and effectively .

"Visualization – Case Study 

 1 . Challenge and selection     With our current online recruiting process , we realized that we received huge   amounts of applicants . However , only a few of these applicants were suitable to fill   the position and on overall would not fit into the company culture . For the organiza- tion this situation caused huge time and money losses . While on the other hand ap- plicants got frustrated with the overall application process . Hence , this was an issue   that needed to be improved .  	    In order make the online recruiting a seeming less experience for both , the recruit- er , hiring manager and the applicant , we decided to use visualization . Changing a   common practice , within an organization is not an easy task . Therefore , we had to   think , how we could best sell in the idea . For us the success of visualization is to   show and uncover all aspects of a process , in order to ensure that all relevant fac- tors have been considered . Humans in general need to “ see ” it , before they believe   it . Therefore , our utmost task was to create a mental image of the intended pro- cess . As soon as we start to visualize our desired outcome , we begin to “ see ” the   possibilities of achieving it . Hence , to convince management of such an incremental   change , visualization seemed to be the best way to do it .     2 . Application and insights     Visualization contains two methods , the first one is outcome visualization and the   second one is process visualization . To maximize our success and to create a strong   picture on the future recruiting process , we decided to apply both methods . For this   to happen , we established a project group of five people . We focused on establish- ing a divers team , with people who possess a broad knowledge and skill set and   who maintain a strong network within the organization . This for instance is im- portant in order to convince people , once the overall project is placed into action .     During the outcome visualization , it was important to envision our company achiev- ing the goal . For instance , we created a detailed map of the desired outcome , by   using all our ideas . Throughout this process we kept asking ourselves several ques- tions . These included : “ How will the organization look like if we reach our goal ? ” ,   “ How will it feel like to reach our goal ( internal / external ) ? ” , “ Which effects will it   have on our company image ? ” and “ What are the feelings of recruiters , hiring man- agers and applicants , if the new process is implemented ” ? .   Of course , we had many   more questions that supported us in creating a good picture of the future scenario .    In the process visualization we focused on envisioning each of the actions necessary   to achieve the desired outcome . The focus was set on how to achieve each single   step to reach the goal . This means , we created a road map for each single step   needed , until the overall goal could be achieved . The roadmap supported us to brief   and convince management of restructuring the current recruiting process . 

 One of the insights we gained was that especially our internal recruiting department   was quite satisfied with the current process . The current , online system would au- tomatically filter out applicants that do not match the formal requirements of the   position . Hence , significantly reducing the time invested , of revising the skills of po- tential candidates .      However , on the other side , hiring managers have not been satisfied with the appli- cants invited for interviews . So , there was a clear mismatch between the actions of   the recruiters and the requirements of the hiring managers . With the visualization   tool and our divers project team , we managed to really show how the process could   look like in future . We realized how important it is to really consider all stakeholders   involved ( internal / external ) . At this stage we realized that Design Thinking can really   support us in understanding our internal and external customers , by directly engag- ing with them .   With Design Thinking and visualization in general , we really man- aged to get a great picture of the current situation in order to picture the future   outcome .     3 . Future outlook – room for improvement  	    We learned how important it is to really understand the needs and requirements of   all stakeholders involved . This requires to experiment a lot more with tools from De- sign Thinking . In future , if we use Design Thinking as tool to innovate internal pro- cesses , we need to make sure to really dig deeper about needs and desired out- comes of potential users .

"Challenge 

 My challenge is to offer an innovative way for kindergarten children ( grades 1 - 5 ) in a particular   school to be encouraged to read more literary books . Children have a need , which is to   understand and be more interested in literature books . My idea is to create a small experiment   group at a school library site to test a form of hybrid teaching using literature . Children usually   prefer to play games on mobile phones and tablets rather than reading books , both physical   and digital . The idea would be to make technology available along with literary education , so   that would be a challenge for children and would do something fun and learning at the same   time . 

 Selection 

 For this I selected the Learning Launch tool as it allows to conduct a small group experiment to   test ideas . As well as allowing us to list the data that work and that do not work , with the   collaborative help of various actors , in which case would be teachers of various classes of the   school . The experiments this tool allows are important because they are fast and cheap ,   allowing you to test whether the idea works or not . This tool enables engagement among   clients , which in this case would be children , along with their teachers . Video   <URL> innovation / lecture / F04r6 / learning - launch - tool 

 Application 

 I applied the Learning Launch tool . First I created my hypothesis , which is to do hybrid teaching   of literature , in a school library for kindergarten students ( 1st to 5th grade ) . I verified and   argued with a group of teachers that several students have “ key ” problems , which are of   interest in literature , reading and understanding the stories . Several students also answered   that they do not like storybooks . I found that my idea meets this need of students and more   interestingly than other ideas , because hybrid teaching in literature will make children   interested in reading , collaborating , being autonomous and learning while having fun and   discovering their creativity . The Learning Launch tool was effective because it allowed me to   create an experiment group , quickly and practically without cost , to test my hypothesis and   also with the support of employees with qualitative and quantitative data . 

 Insight 

 Using the Learning Launch tool I was able to apply my hypothesis to the group of children and   get their answer , validating the experiment , because they were receptive to the new idea of   learning , participatory and collaborative . In fact , the data from the experiment were better than   imagined in the hypothesis . Four groups ( station rotation ) were set up in the library , where each   group had a particular task to accomplish at a given time and then moved to another group . For   example , storytelling by the teacher , acting drama by students , conducting online puzzles , using 

 the Khan Academy platform by students . The best of the tool was the ability to test an idea   quickly and without cost , knowing the need of the public and be able to obtain data that confirm   the facts . As well as I discovered What Wow and What <NAME> . 

 Approach 

 What I could do differently or test new tool would be to use the historytelling tool . Because it   is fun , creates an emotional connection with the target audience , children , so they would find   it interesting to participate in the ideas . In historytelling , there would be a "" cause "" for   elaboration , inspiring questions and moments of reflection would be created , creating a   tension of ideas . Using historytelling for dissemination and design thinking for literature is also   an excellent idea as it blends the stories , ideas , drawings , colors . And possibility of creating   historytelling with animations and multimedia . Using technology for the reality of 21st century   children .

"Roaming Journey : 

 Challenge : 

 I am working as a customer experience manager in a telecomunication firm and I am responsible for   improving the customer ’s experince in roaming . To maked the customer feel satisfied in their   journey , we provide many opportunities by giving them special offers and free application data but   unfourtanetly the customers think that those are so limited and imcompotent . The company which I   work for , has many departments and all the departments have different goals so the products can be   driven not too sufficient for customers . Especially the roaming journey experience is very sensitive   point for customers ’ life because thet feel alone in another country . They need special solutions fort   their communication in the roaming . 

 So the challenge can be described as “ feeling alone in roaming ” . The main reasons are obviou . Such   as packages are expensive and they refuse to use phone for communication . Although they prefer to   use another operatör for roaming because this is more cheaper than their own operatör . 

 To solve this problem and make them satisfied in their journey , we make a Project anc in this Project   there are many workers in diffent departments . We came together and talked about the method   which we used to produce something well for the customer . 

 Team contains developers , product managers , customer experience managers , project managers and   we started to use design thinking methodology to produce something new for the customers   journey . 

 We did n’t face to face any challange because of misunderstandings because DT allows us to say   antyhing and decide together with the team . In order to compete with the competitors , the point is    understanding the same problem with   brainstorming and getting the best solution for the Project . 

 Selection : 

 I selectect <NAME> mapping tool for this challange . To make the <NAME> journey problems more   definable in diffent ways and I looked patterns with my team , we tried to get insights from the   interviews and we used empathy as a key point of the Project . We tried to understand every step of   their journey . With mind mapping we organized the information we gathered and decided   innovations we need . 

 Application : 

 I start the process by giving papers and pens to all ones in my team . Cause we have some documents   and analysis abount roaming customers and the needs , the analyzed data gives us the main persona   which we have to focus on and if we solve the problem of this persone we can touch the big volume   of the roaming customers . We combined all the analysises together and started group them ,   understand the main persona . 

 After we decide persona , we started 2nd step in the desing thinking Project . We try to understand   the main suffers fort hem by writing all the sceneria in little papers and stick them to the Wall then   we put sign for the ones which we likes . In the third step we diverge and converge for possible ideas . 

 Finally we produce a page which includes choice of package , the timezone follow or anything they   need in roaming and we designed it in Digital Operator application and when the customers try to   use this area in their trip or before their trip they found everything they needed . We understood that   the solution ise successful . 

 Insights and <NAME> : 

 This exercise with group members is necessary to understand the problem . It is easy to   find the right   solution . Creativity is the main point for producing outputs . And this methodology provides make   one think more creative . We also creates a comfortable area for customers and using the tools like   prototyping and experimentation and visualizing provide us a new way of reflection , in order to be an   innovative thinker in business . I ’ve learned from design thinking that empathy is the key of creating   something new and the only methodology to do so is Design Thinking .

"Visualization 

 Challenge 

 As Payment system project manager , I manage on our organization many innovative projects using   <NAME> <NAME> that involves using several design thinking activities / tools with all stakeholders as   Business team , Development team , testing team , so in other to explain the customers ’ needs   efficiently , we need to visualize so that the whole team have the same comprehension , 

 Our team is working on a <ADDRESS> payment project using methods of Scrum framework , one of   customer needs ( Our customer is a bank ) is to edit a contract for the Mobile payment holders that   should be printed and signed when opening their <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> account at the agency . 

 Selection 

 Our scrum team has decided to use visualization as design thinking activities because we can tap into   a single picture and by the more we begin using pictures , the more that we begin to diagram while we   talk , and create a visual image for all the team .      Application 

 As member of scrum team ( scrum master ) , first I started by drawing on a whiteboard , the contract   canvas using existing contract model that we used for others Payment Products as reference . 

 After that the team start discussion about the information the we need to populate the contract , so   each member team started drawing on the whiteboard that it seems important to him ( Mobile wallet   holder First Name , Mobile wallet holder last Name , Mobile wallet holder birthdate , Mobile wallet   account type , Mobile wallet account number , … ) , after that I start regrouping those information onto   contract canvas by creating complex model of how the scrum team think the customer experience   ideally is going to work by focusing on those main information . 

 Then , I started asking 3 questions to the scrum team and invite them to use sticky note to respond , the   first question 

 1 . What key elements are missing from the canvas ? 

 the second question 

 2 . What would we change about the canvas to make it simple with the involvement of all the 

 legal article ? 

 the third question 

 3 . On which moment on the process , the contract should be printed ? 

 I give them 10 minutes to discuss the three questions 

 The team report their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their sticky   note . I record commonalities in the insights of each team member , and then additional insights that   come from the discussion on the white board . After this session , the product owner as team member   creates a view that combines the shared and new insights from the discussion , and then create a 

 revised canvas that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a scrum   team . 

 Insight 

 By using Visualization , our scrum team had the ability to create good user story that involved the   insight of all scrum team ( product owner , scrum master , and development team ) with detailed   acceptance criteria , while responding of 3C concept used in AGILE approaches to create user story that   should be developed and be de part of sprint backlog . 

 Approach 

 Next time , I would use the mind mapping activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking   activities to launch the testing activity of that user story by looking for patterns and insights in a large   quantity of data collected during the step above , which can serve as a reference tool throughout the   remainder of our work .

"Challenge : 

 I am working for a Pharma Company as a part of the Marketing division . My role is of designing   visual - aids and other marketing materials for Marketing Reps working on the field . The marketing   reps were currently briefing the doctors through physical media like thick books which were   cumbersome and little outdated to match with today ’s digital era . 

 The challenge was to convert this system into digital media which becomes easier for the marketing   people to brief and handle . 

 Selection : 

 The team comprised of many people and stake - holders like : The front end team , the back end team ,   I as the coordinator / facilitator and the content provider for this project . The design thinking which   we chose was learning launch to design and test the prototype before going live . 

 Application : 

 All the marketing team / divisions were called for the meeting to decide on the process and flow . The   structure was designed first as to how the data will be collected and routed to different stake- holders and sent to the development team for production for Beta - testing before making it live on   the iPads of the Marketing Reps for actual briefing of the products to the doctors at their clinics and   hospitals . 

 I had created the designs already and had to convert them into the format required by the IT Team .   The artworks and product sequencing was handed over to the production team and after lot of   coordination and some iterations the Visual - Aids were digitalized into iPad and send for testing . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 The outcome was brilliant . The iPad Beta testing was a great path to success . With little hindrances   initially , we worked on the areas successfully to remove the glitches . With the pilot phase over , the   new process created a niche of its own .   The Physical bulky version was replaced by the smart digital   iPad . The Doctors found it quite intriguing and engaging to be briefed in an interactive manner . 

 Moreover , it was now easier to track the behavior and the time devoted by every Sales person for   the purpose and to rectify and behavior if needed using metrics . 

 This certainly was a breakthrough and created a turning point . The result : Sales went high with   quality leads . Thus a proper design thinking approach and prototype testing yielded exceptional   results for all stakeholders and paved a way to SMART digitization .

 managed both on a single platform , integrated use that the emphasis is . And 3.0 from 

 the 4.0 to advanced services made jeoya word to . In the traditional marketing market industry , 

 banking app , card app , capital app , and loan app must each be installed as a service app for 

 a financial company , and individuals have to use the respective institutions one by one 

 by consenting to personal information . 

 Application 

 The comprehensive innovation plan is to secure the existing customer excellence and platform 

 influence in a digital financial environment that is friendly to big tech , while opening up the digital 

 financial   market   centered on big   tech   and inducing   the   emergence   of digital 

 financial unicorn companies . It is necessary to pursue a strategy for this .

 expanding coverage is needed . No matter how good the platform is , if there are not various bank 

 installment   products   and insurance   products in   the   internal   structure , customer   churn 

 will occur . Partnerships Various product contracts must be formed . 

 Second , it is necessary to respond to changes in the platform environment . As long as IT expertise 

 and development are required , it must be a successful service through a lot of manpower , time , 

 and testing , and it is necessary to build an infrastructure with standard API ( Application 

 Programming Interface ) and open banking services . 

 Teamwork is important in 4.0 service design , such as UIUX blueprint and peer group comparison

"Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared   understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to   identify and define possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our customers ,   who are government agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission   or the delivery of their services to their customer , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens , businesses , and non- citizens . I have used the technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set   of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each   other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between   elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO   or other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one- three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . If appropriate to   the situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous research , and   discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage approach   helps to reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with   whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide   the service . The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and   Value Chain Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as   Congress , GAO , labor unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how   the organization operates . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available   in <NAME> or on the Internet . If the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a   different type of visual , either based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different   stakeholders , or another format . For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6   participants each representing a different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a   poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make   comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing   from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect   your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities   in your problem space ? I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up   the graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three questions while   pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I record commonalities in the   insights of each group , and then additional insights that come from the group discussion on an   additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a   view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a revised   graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic –   especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is   the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows   them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems .   While they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a   straw man jump starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the   graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between   key entities instead of taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem   space – that is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain   information or data to provide the values for the variables . Since I discovered that the most valuable   aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting   point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their   combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their work . 

"
"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge   Currently , we have no established service offering that depicts how design thinking can create more value   or how we can ultimately create better customer value at my organisation .   I am at a technology consulting   firm that focuses more on the delivery of projects than on the discovery of projects . I want my organisation   to start using design thinking to help define the right problem      To ensure that I had support from the business , I had a series of meetings and workshops with senior   stakeholders to engage them and help them conceptualise the benefit . To help these stakeholders   conceptualise the value of adopting design thinking concepts and the value of using them in the work we   do , I brought them on the journey that I had been through in my discovery of design and its benefits .      Through this course I learnt the value of design thinking and how important it is to speak to and understand   your user / customer .   I find the power of empathy invigorating and believe that finding meaning in the work   that you do and sharing my learnings with others is important . As this belief was shared by a few others at   my organisation , we formed a small working group to challenge the above problem .      Selection   I am going to use the mind mapping technique from session 3 , idea generation . I am choosing to use this   tool specifically because I am working with a small working group where everyone has different ideas of the   direction we want the organsation to go in . I will use this working group to work towards improving the   service offerings we have for our clients .      In doing the mind mapping I plan to identify patterns and themes . We will use the affinity mapping   technique to group insights that have common themes so we will be able to see outliers . I really like using   mind mapping as a way of brainstorming as it allows me to work collaboratively with others to ideate and   co - create . Each person will have equal opportunity to share their ideas with the group . Once I perform this   exercise I will be able to determine the different personas for the ranging audiences that this will be sold to .   This is very important as each persona will have different motivations and thus , different stated and   unstated needs .      Application   I will run a 1 hour mind mapping workshop . I will start the workshop by introducing a how might we   statement to ensure that everyone is aligned . “ How might we incorporate human centred design into our   current service offering so we can provide an end - to - end service to our client that really investigates the   end users ’ needs ? ” I will aim to mind map the ideas and values of the current state of the organsation and   explore where we want to be in the future .      I will have everyone brainstorm their ideas individually for a few minutes . Then they will pair up and share   their ideas with another person . Finally , everyone will come back to the group ( 8 people ) to discuss . This   will give everyone the opportunity to explore different ideas that they might not have thought of . The sharing   of ideas is really powerful as it allows different people to have a voice . Usually a meeting that involves   discussion and brainstorming is overpowered by an extrovert ’s agenda or the opinion of the highest paid   person in the room ; this can limit diversity of idea generation .      From this we will use affinity mapping to identify common themes and outliers . Once we have done this we   can have an open discussion about how to move forward as a company using the insights we developed in   our mapping . This will help facilitate co - creation so that everyone feels that they have contributed towards   these changes . This will ensure that everyone has a better understanding of the value of design thinking by   applying this to our projects .      Insights   Throughout the brainstorm we were able to share and collaborate our ideas . During the session people   challenged each other and as facilitator , I tried to have a productive brainstorming session by including   every topic mentioned and by not letting anyone shutdown other people ’s ideas . If I ran this workshop   again , I would initially place more emphasis on the importance of getting all ideas down and on people   respecting everyone ’s ideas . This will help with the discussion and any challenges when people do n’t   agree . 

 After we completed the brainstorm exercise , I provided everyone with a single vote each for what they   believed is highest priority . To do this we used affinity mapping to group together similar insights and   related themes that we believed complimented each other . These are evident by the rainbow outlining   below . In addition to this , relationships between the different ideas grew more and more evident and it   became easier to understand the direction we wanted to go in and what values we would be able to   package as a service offering .      In employing values of stewardship and resilience we want to go forward and make this service   sustainable . As evidenced by the image below , we found that the key element underpinning the different   ideas is to embed and empower our people to have a growth mindset . Going forward if we continue to be   open to learning and accepting uncertainty , we can be far more innovative and learn to fail fast and quick .      At the end of the exercise , everyone in the room acknowledged its effectiveness . We worked together to   understand the problem statement and determine how to address it in a short period of time . 

 Approach & Next Steps   Going forward , I would split this brainstorming session up to allow for the initial discussion about the   problem so that we define it more clearly before brainstorming . I noticed that people started to mislead the   conversation at points . This resulted in some ideas not being explored in enough detail .     I would like to include a few more senior stakeholders next time . Stakeholders ’ will then be able to validate   assumptions early . This will also help drive the initiative and demonstrate top down support within the   organisation .     In future I am excited to use some of these insights to start workshopping how we can share this with our   organisation . It is important for us to bring everyone along on the journey to successfully address the   changes . I hope to continue practicing my learning by introducing visualisation facilitation in coming   workshops to help solve complex problems . This will help highlight the importance of being able to show   and not tell . Each of the different topics learnt in this course are so powerful when used together . As people   become more comfortable with ideation , I will start applying visualisation facilitation and storytelling to help   drive the conversation about benefits for the end user . By pairing our strengths in strategic and analytical   thinking with curiosity using design thinking , I hope to contribute to the ongoing success of my organisation .

"Example Reflection- Visualization and story telling 

 <NAME> 

 I do n’t work in a professional jobs nor do I have a business firm to handle . Right now I am 

 pursuing my degree at Qatar University in GD Goenka . Forest and we had entrepreneurship 

 course during our 6th semester . I have always been interested in Business including some of my 

 fellow mates and there has been an interesting activities during this course were we have to come 

 up with an innovative idea to open up a relevant business suitable of our environment and pitch it 

 in the class . We were divided into groups and each groups have to come up with a different 

 ideas . I had interesting ideas jumbling in my head and out of all these astonishing ideas , our 

 group decided to pitch our business idea on Food Hub . The idea was in fact new and innovative 

 but we lacked the way to present it and we had a tough time agreeing upon a common decisions . 

 Selection and Application 

 We knew the idea were superb but we lacked the ability to present and convince our lecturer and 

 other mates about the framework and the potential opportunities it possesses . Then another idea 

 clicked our mind , we planned to present our idea through visual presentation . We started to draw 

 the basic ideas that we had on the chart paper . We drew a bus and designed it in such a way that 

 it looks perfectly attractive for delivery services in the central of the chart paper and then around 

 it we drew our target customers , to whom we want avail our services , the resources that we 

 would require such as machines , vegetables , pastry items and utensils . We also drew the 

 sponsorship firms which we would seek help from and the items that we will be serving to the 

 customer . Through visualization , the audience were able to capture the clear idea of what we 

 were trying to present to them and we were also able to show them the picture which were 

 difficult for us explain and elaborate . 

 While presenting , we also used the method of storytelling in which we told the audience about 

 the story of two brothers who drove van and sold hamburgers and ice creams along the street of 

 <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> sans their struggles during the start of the journey till the successful business they are 

 running right now . The story beautifully aligned with our idea and we were able to convince our 

 audience more . They were really able to grasp what we were trying to say and were impressed 

 with the way we presented . 

 Insight 

 While using the methods of Design thinking , I realized that these fundamental tool possesses an 

 important value and serve as an entirely different way of expressing our ideas and thinking . They 

 are not only an easy method to use but also provide ways to disseminate wide array of 

 information to the audience . The audience were able to understand the concepts we are trying to 

 share and it enables them to identify the main concepts thereby reducing time and energy . 

 Through storytelling , we are able to use our imagination and make a connection with the story 

 and generate more ideas . The audience can see our ideas through the story that we tell them and 

 grasp a concrete ideas and pictures our innovation . 

 Approach 

 I found these tools and approaches very useful in terms of building our ideas in a more realistic 

 way and I think I will be using these tools as long as I get shortage of these tools .

 <NAME> <NAME> <NAME>    <EMAIL> 

 Challenge & Selection 

 When I first got in touch with the Design Thinking approach , one of the first things that   really interested me was the tool of <NAME> . As a Logistics Performance   Coordinator , my team is responsible for consolidating the numbers regarding budgets ,   results and expenditures , trends , consolidate the main KPIs and all the reporting for   the Logistics area .    I used to feel very frustrated when we were showing all the leaders and the decision   makers the numbers and presentations in a way that was only informative . I felt that   somehow we were failing to tell a good story that could change the way they   understand how the Logistics Team could contribute , for example , to achieve a better   result , to understand how the teams could be challenged or even how logistics could   increase the Service Level provided to the customers .   When my team and I started to discuss the better ways to inspire our leaders to see   the Logistics process not only as a necessary cost , but also as a competitive path to   deliver value to the customers , we started to put ourselves in their position and that ’s   when the <NAME> tool seemed to be appropriate . We challenged ourselves to try   to imagine how they would react to the information that we were showing , how they   could connect with a subject that they do n’t have a technical understanding , where   were the pain points that would need their intervention , so that the presentation and   the reports would change from an informative tool to a moment of sharing experiences   and an inspiration to new ideas . 

 Application 

 The first time we applied the <NAME> tool for the purpose of building a different   Presentation for a better engagement of the Business Leaders was a Logistics Follow   Up Meeting that we have regularly with the Vice President and his <NAME> . My team   and I sat previously together with the Business Performance team – that was always   providing on a daily basis presentations and other reports to those leaders – and   discussed the overall perception that they have about their particular approach with   other subjects and how they better react to information and interact with it . In that way   we could use their inputs to build up an experience that could interest the leaders , that   would change the presentation from a technical perspective to a more business   focused and to show them our challenges in a form that they would contribute and feel   part of the solution . 

 Insight & Approach 

 When we started the presentation , the leaders ’ reactions to it were instantaneous . We   started it by telling the story about the impacts on the Company ’s results – cost   reduction , overall performance and always connecting with the EBITDA terms , so that   they could follow everything on their particular language – then we talked about the   Projects and New Ideas and how they interact with the Business . We also brought   images and videos to give a better idea of the technical concepts that we shared so

 <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <EMAIL> <EMAIL>                                                2 

 that they could have a better understand on why that information was so important . We   also left questions to be addressed by them in that specific forum . For example , we   were trying to develop projects that the Law Department was not prioritizing , the we   shared with the leaders the simplicity of the change we wanted to make by presenting   in a map that we were trying to change the billing point of a process to reduce the   travelled distance , impacting in an important cost reduction , they immediately got   involved and wanted to ensure that the project would be prioritized at that moment .   The insight was very clear for my team and I and we really understood that before we   use the <NAME> approach , we were trying to tell the leaders a story that was making   sense to us , but was not including them to design our strategies or even making an   effort to make that information understandable to them . When we changed the way we   showed the data , changing the perspective in a way that brings them to a dialogue and   simplify the discussions so that they got a clearer understanding of our challenges and   how they could contribute to solve them , the meetings started to be very inspiring and   strategical .   So after this first excellent experience that we had , the <NAME> tool became   essential to conduct every report and presentation that my team created . We also   started to get a good reputation on that field and we felt more enthusiastic to do a job   that is really useful and that creates a good expectation on the audience because they   feel curious now on how we are planning to share the information on the next time !

"DIGITAL MANUFACTURING – STORY TELLING 

 CHALLENGE 

 There is a pressing need to deploy engineering solutions for increasing global resilience against   natural disasters and climate change . The 2020 Digital Manufacturing Challenge is a call for   action to inspire the next generation of engineers to think about ways to deploy engineering   design and manufacturing solutions to strengthen the response , mitigation and/or prevention of   such disruptive events and envision an optimistic view of robust , sustainable , smart – even   agile communities . The tools of digital manufacturing are many , varied and powerful . They   span the nano to the giga scales , transforming our world with data and engineering solutions to   meet the needs of both the few and the many – often on demand . Increasing interoperability ,   shorter product lifecycles , the ability to simplify or integrate features and functions , while   simultaneously reducing size , weight , part count , and the need for rapid deployment are all   providing opportunities to demonstrate both the capabilities and possibilities of digital   manufacturing . Students are asked to consider the many aspects of digital manufacturing and   how they can enhance sustainability , health , security , and the joy of living through applications   combining additive and subtractive manufacturing . 

 Cross - functional student teams are challenged to go beyond “ additive only ” to leverage the full   power of digital manufacturing through design , analysis and optimization for a higher purpose .   Possible solutions may include infrastructure - level systems or elements but are not necessarily   limited to : 

 •   Sustainable housing 

 •   Applications for abundant clean water and power 

 •   Rapid and remote or on - site disaster prevention , mitigation or response 

 SELECTION 

 Digital manufacturing has opened a new window in the way to approach the manufacture of   parts . The possible switch from manufacturing and holding physical stock to manoeuvring with   a fully - digital one is promising but still has not been undertaken‑or only in a small proportion ‑by the majority of the manufacturing companies . What are the cost and productivity frontiers   that halt the transformation taking place so far ? When does it make sense , in terms of   production volume and costs , to undertake this transformation ? What level of savings could be   achieved and what investments would be favourable ? The base line of the present chapter is to   depict quantitative tools to address the potential impact of endeavouring digital transformation   in manufacturing environments , considering costing and production variables , as well as   technological decision - making parameters . 

 APPLICATION 

 Industry 4.0 is signalling a change in the traditional manufacturing landscape . Also known as   the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , Industry 4.0 encompasses three technological trends driving   this   transformation :   connectivity ,   intelligence   and   flexible   automation . 

 Industry 4.0 converges IT ( Information Technology ) and OT ( Operational Technology ) , to   create a cyber - physical environment . This convergence has been made possible thanks to the   emergence of digital solutions and advanced technologies , which are often associated with   Industry 4.0 . These include : 

 •   Industrial Internet of Things 

 •   Big Data 

 •   Cloud computing 

 •   Additive manufacturing ( AM ) 

 •   Advanced robotics 

 •   Augmented and virtual reality ( AR / VR ) 

 These technologies are helping to drive manufacturing ’s digital transformation through the   integration of previously disparate systems and processes through interconnected computer   systems across the value and supply chain . Embracing Industry 4.0 , digital manufacturing and   the interconnectivity that comes with it opens a myriad of benefits for companies , including   greater agility , flexibility and operational performance . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 Improve operations visibility with the SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud solution , a   manufacturing execution system ( MES ) of near real - time data and analytics . Execute   manufacturing processes , analyze manufacturing and business data , and integrate systems with   a cost - effective , high - quality , and resource - efficient method based on Industry 4.0 . 

 •   Cloud deployment 

 •   Visibility across the top floor and shop floor 

 •   Powerful key performance indicators ( KPIs ) and analytics 

 •   Detailed execution of production processes

"Reflection on Mind Mapping | <NAME> <NAME>       Challenge   My Client is a European governmental institution embarking on a new way of working .   One where different Service Providers work in an ecosystem to collaboratively provide   end - to - end services to their IT users , bringing value to the <ADDRESS> . Being the Service   Integrator , my organisation takes over the operational responsibilities of the Service   Management processes , on behalf of the <ADDRESS> . For that to be possible the project   needed the to implement the Service Management framework and processes .      To be successful I realised that , more importantly , we also needed the engagement and   contribution of the Service Providers to collaborate and support each - other , playing as   one team . To reinforce that idea , we needed to introduce “ Ecosystem Commitment ” into   the contracts between the Client and the Service Providers .      The challenge was to establish common grounds with a diverse group of stakeholders   with the intention to emphasise how we would like to see all of us working , with respect   and consideration of the impact on each member , and where everyone is clear on   expected behaviours and outcomes .     Selection   This tangible result to achieve , the “ Ecosystem Commitment ” document , is empty at the   start with the intention to jointly discuss and agree during the first stage in the project .   Because it is not adding new metrics or services but rather taking a different perspective   and thinking on how we can achieve this commitment , we proposed to leverage the Mind   Mapping tools . As <NAME> <NAME> is intuitive , creative , and engaging , we used <NAME>   Mapping to boil it down into a jointly agreed charter for how everyone will behave and   operate . Facilitated workshops , <NAME> <NAME> and visualisation helped us to distil the   common grounds for the collaboration principles .     Application   Prior to the facilitated workshop we instilled the idea with the stakeholders that no - one   can pull off a delightful collaboration experience on their own and invited 35 participants ,   in different roles , representing the ecosystem partners , to discover what it would look   like . At the start we have made a lot of inputs available to the participants such as :   Strategic Objectives , Statement of Works , Service Level Agreement , Governance   Exhibits , RASCI Matrices , Key personnel and the different views and understanding on   ecosystem collaboration from the Service providers . 

 Powerful live - cartooning facilitated from ComicHouse   ( <URL> )   helped us clarify and it immediately led us to new    discussions and to new insights . All of which were   collated and then grouped .      The participants were grouped into mixed teams across   the Service Providers and assigned to have a discussion   related to collaboration rules and principles . We used   the Mural canvas ,   online whiteboard 

 ( <URL> ) , to collaborate with the teams ,   to collate and combine virtual post - its .   In the plenary   session , teams reported - out and the workshop was   successfully concluded with a set of 10 collaboration   principles ( rules ) we could all jointly agree upon . 

 ComicHouse Cartoon 

 Mural Canvas 

 Insights & Approach   Due to Covid-19 restrictions we needed to convene fully remote workshops , we used MS   Teams ( with separate breakouts ) and collaboration tools . Most of the participants did not   know each other beforehand and yet we decided not to waste time on introduction   rounds . We expected such introductions to occur organically during the workshops and   we have learned that it did .      We also learned it is a good idea to share the objectives ( i.e. establishing collaboration   rules and principles ) prior to the workshop with all participants . It turned out most of   them came with a prepared mindset , were able to browse the input materials , and   quickly further develop their views into the principles that we were aiming for .      The Mural canvas provided the diverse group of participants a central point , it enabled   their discussions and the sharing and exchanging of ( virtual ) Post - it memos . The   powerful visualisation tools ( ComicHouse ) helped us exchanging ideas , sharing insights   and , as an extra benefit , it provided us with a lot of graphics . The Service Providers can   now use the graphics even beyond the workshop to evangelize the behaviour principles   we had established in their respective organisations .      I have learned <NAME> <NAME> provides for a structured approach for establishing common   grounds ( with great contribution from powerful visualisation ) and in future I would   structure the flow of the workshops even more to get the most out of it . I believe an   even better output quality can be achieved when leveraging more <NAME> <NAME>   resources than we have done in this case .       Although we were restricted in many ways ( working remotely ) , the results were no less   than we have previously experienced in pre - Covid on - site workshops , thanks to Mind   Mapping .

"Challenge & Selection : 

 The Visualization tool is strongly effective tool in design thinking process to solve the problem . I used   this tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding of a problem of   innovative graphic design to identify and define possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach   often with our customers , who are different small and big companies or individuals working to apply   technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their services to their customer ,   which may be citizens , businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the technique of using a straw man   visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse   group of customers to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key   elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain points and   opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Application : 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO   or other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one- three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . If appropriate to the   situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous research , and discussed   in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage approach helps to   reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with whom the   service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the service .   The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain   Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO ,   labor unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization   operates . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the   Internet . If the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual ,   either based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders , or another   format . For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing   a different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man   graphic that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three   questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you   change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights   do you have about the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I give them   approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have each group   report out on their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As   each group reports out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional   insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I   digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared and new insights   from the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and   proposed changes that they agreed to as a group .

"Challenge 

 The challenge is the decreasing views of an advertisement among the public in social media .   The advertisement was a go . And it was published in the social media in place X , organised by   company Z. 

 Selection 

 Mind mapping . I have used the technique of using mind mapping of a problem domain with a   set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn   from each other . 

 Application 

 I started by contacting the target groups that is , the probable customers and asking them about   their interests and the time when they use the social media . Also enquired about the awareness   about the brand and the advertisement . Then ,   tried to find out the reasons for them to ignore   the ad . Noted down the reasons in sticky note . Also , several users were contacted from different   demographics . And the reasons were clubbed together under different common criteria . About   the time , the attractiveness , the design aspect etc . As per the demographics , recorded common   insights of each , and then additional insights that come from the group discussion . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The insight which I got was that the time at which the new ad went up needs to be changed .   Since there was frequent and regular power issue during the time ad went in that particular   locality , many were not able to see it . Therefore , the target time was the issue and the ad needs   to be changed to target specific number of users . Also , according to geography , time needs to   be changed . By this approach , keeping customers at the centre is crucial for the growth of   business and its growth . The Design thinking process helped in fixing the issue and the   advertisements started getting hits from the social media users .

"Visualization – Visual Thinking in IT Projects 

 Challenge     I work in the IT area and I have as a goal to develop innovative technological solutions for new   businesses . My biggest challenge is to develop a solution that brings value to the business , according to   the schedule and the budget planned . These solutions are created through IT projects that serves   different areas such as sales , marketing , logistics , financial , accounting and taxes . Usually the business   areas are the project requesters and their demands are not always clear enough to create an IT solution   that adds value to the business quickly . The project development is outsourced , which increases even   more the failures risks due to poor communication . In addition , the solution validation is supported by   limited internal resources that have not always participated in the project from the beginning . My main   focus is to minimize the poor communication among stakeholders to avoid solutions without value and   reworks that undermine project timing and cost . 

 Selection     We have had several unsuccessful experiences to align the needs and the new solutions for the projects .   By having multidisciplinary teams , the only verbal communication , brought communication errors between   participating areas , for example , a project to develop a logistic system has the logistics area and IT area   as main stakeholders . In this case , when we talked about the need to increase the infrastructure for the   project , the logistics team understood that it was for to increase the physical area and for an IT team , it   was for to increase the servers . In order to reduce communication errors , we start with the Visual Thinking   as a support to communicate . The use of graphical elements helped to reduce the communication   mistakes , where in the cited example , we designed a group of servers to communicate that we wanted to   increase the IT infrastructure , aiming a purchase of more servers to support the new logistics system to   be developed .     Application     I use the graphical elements of the Visual Thinking according to the topic addressed in the discussion .   For example , if the intention is to approach new ideas for a problem , I use graphic elements such as   ellipses to describe the central theme of the problem within the graph , from the central theme it is   possible to branch out the ideas exposed by the team in new ellipses , where each idea is described   inside the branched chart , this technique is similar to the mind map . When the objective is to discuss the   project processes to be developed , I choose to draw a flowchart with the graphical elements that   represent the processes through rectangles , the decisions through lozenges and the expected outputs as   documents through a rectangle in portrait mode and database through a disk or even the continuity of a   new flowchart to address a new related process . When the project solution has not yet been defined and   we aim to share the problem and stimulate empathy among those involved , I use free designs to create a   story . To illustrate this approach , I use drawings as a dollar sign to represent the increased sales , the   straw man graphic to represent users , and any other elements that are present in the story told , such as   cellphone drawings to represent the development of a new mobile application or server drawings to   represent the infrastructure of a system . The composition of these elements according to the evolution of   the story resulted in the creation of a Storyboard . 

 Insight     By applying the Visual Thinking to project discussions , the team developed more insights when creating   new IT solutions that brought value to the business , as <NAME> helped to understand the cause of the   problem in a simple way and stakeholders became more empathic while the story was told and illustrated   with the graphic elements . In addition , during the projects executions , the team identified a decrease in   communication failures between outsourced companies that were responsible for systems development   and internal resources , which are responsible for the deliverables validation . Keeping the communication   among those involved with designed support resulted in the alignment of the communication that reduced   the rework during the execution of project , where we had more deliveries in time and on budget planned .   Finally , I emphasize that the graphic elements helped the team to quickly identify the absence of a key   element to create a new solution , the team also became more agile in the construction and validation of   the systemic processes to be implemented in the projects . The Visual Thinking stimulated the learning   and active participation of those involved , including the search for new ideas in the projects .     Approach     As the Visual Thinking reduced communication problems and we were able to deliver more projects in   less time and within budget , I added the <NAME> technique to increase empathy and insight among   those involved in finding more innovative and valuable solutions for the business . Storytelling main goal is   to sensitize people with real stories so they can reflect , because <NAME> raises the level of any   communication . Thus , while Storytelling narrates the problem , the Visual Thinking reduces the risks of   communication , as the story visualization develops over time , I can create a Storyboard with the true   emotions of the stakeholders , allowing them to have an active voice in determining the narrative to find   out the solution to the problem . Therefore , Design Thinking has two techniques that I use a lot in my   projects : Visual Thinking and Storytelling . I share that the combination of these two techniques brought a   great result for my projects , as the team became more involved in the projects , besides delivering more   innovative and competitive solutions in the IT business .

"Reflection- Visualisation 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I have been into designing of outfits for quite some time . It has always been my ideas that have   put into designs and sold . But when it came to customisation it has been a great task to put in   front what exactly the customer would need . Often the ideas are mis interrupted in the process   and corrected later . This gave me a hectic job to rework on the final work . In due course we   realised the representation must be in visual format as in drawings or illustration that in turn   would reduce the last - minute hassle . 

 The visualisation helps to bring better understanding about the concept with the help images   and diagrams . Drawing is an ability to bring the level of understanding better . So , considering   the problem we use the visualisation tool better and thus solves the problem . 

 Application 

 I have been struggling with the implementation of the same since I have decided about the   visualisation concept . It was hard for me to convince my peers for an illustrated design sampled   clothing over the store that normally works on real fabrics . I feel convincing my colleagues   and moving towards illustrated examples would save ample of time and also reduces the   wastage of resources and manpower . Hence this idea is would bring betterment in the work   taken . 

 If the output is so doubtful this method would add clarity and solve the issue . In bulk production   this method would help in sending samples online and getting affirmation regarding same in   quick time period . 

 Insight and approach 

 Well , on quoting examples of many leading designers and explaining the problem with the   presented solution it could be made clearer that how this idea would work . On the other hand ,   the idea can be further motivated and animated in 3 - D to help client better ideas on the output . 

 This approach helps to go back and recreate any outfit created and helps to alter the colour and   combinations . This in turn reduces the pressure and anxiety of clients as well as the   manufacturers worrying about the output . 

 The approach would enlighten a new posted method of fashion . The extended approach would   be making miniatures of models that in turn would help us understand the needs of customers . 

 This methodology and outcome of this course would help me to analyse my problems in design   thinking perspective . Bringing innovation into business and being ready with alter plans if   proposed method fails was really an important outcome of the course . 

 I am an engineer and this course would enlighten my creative ideas and help me visualise the   ideas and plan accordingly which would lead me to path with better solutions .

"DESIGN TOOL- STORYTELLING 

 Challenge and selection : 

 I work in an organization as a manager . I am supposed to design a course on the   subject “ General data protection regulations ” . As I have observed my co- workers since a long time , I know that they are impatient in listening . My   challenge is to make them learn GDPR through my course as early as possible   since the subject was an urgent requirement . 

 After all design thinking is phenomenon that comes in the context of user   centered design of solution . In my context my co - workers are the users . So the   solution I choose should be heartily acceptable and embraceable by the users . 

 Hence I thought of a story telling tool to make the course interesting . I believe   that story telling play major role in 3 stages of design . They are : 1 ] Problem   framing 2 ] Solution framing 3 ] Solution implementation . Story telling is tool that   helps to connect events as a holistic experience through time . 

 There are many ways to tell a story . It may be in the form of a visual   presentation , animation , scenario generation etc . 

 I chose animation and visual presentation as the tools to educate my co- workers . 

 Application : 

 Initially the co - workers were introduced to course using a visual presentation of   the essentiality of the subject that is introduced in the course . To make them   more interesting many games were also played during the course of lectures . 

 To introduce the core concepts of data protection regulations , an animation   tool called DOODLE is used . This tool helps us to create the animated version of   the story which enabled the learners to engage themselves more effectively . 

 In the narration of the story I ensured that there are real life scenarios   connecting the concepts so that the concept remains in the memory for long   time . 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 I learned that the educating people in the way they are comfortable is an   effective education process . When learning becomes joy , then the skills are   gained quicker . Thus it is possible apply the same in an effective manner . 

 The approach that I have chosen for my application is one the best design tools   I have come across . So I do n’t prefer alternative tools for design thinking .

"Challenge 

 I work with a lot of young entrepreneurs in the start - up ecosystem , partnering them on their journey   from the Inception stage to the Growth stage . A lot of times , these extremely talented entrepreneurs   find it difficult to break out of the technological biases of their minds and connect with investors and   customers . This comes across as a major challenge and results , in a lot of cases , in disappointment and   untimely death of their ideas . 

 Solution   In my associations with these entrepreneurs , I help them understand the importance of <NAME> and   help them inculcate it in their culture to ensure that they are able to understand and appeal to the   human side of their investors and customers . 

 Application   In one my interventions , I came across an entrepreneurial duo who had come up with an idea that had   the potential to become a pathbreaking disruptor in the existing market . However , even with a brilliant   solution , riding on future - focused technology , they were not making any headway commercially as they   were repeatedly failing to garner investor confidence and wallet share . 

 As the first step to add value with my association , I studied their case and found the following : 

 •   They had a very strong domain expertise 

 •   They had future - focused technology as their platform 

 •   They had a meticulously defined Project Plan 

 Everything seemed watertight and impenetrable . 

 That made me thinking and I accompanied them o their meetings with investors . And , that ’s when I   understood their challenge : 

 •   They came across as too perfect – too good to be true 

 •   They talked too technical – focusing too much on their solution and the technology behind it 

 •   Their focus was on the brilliant technology they had come up with 

 All impressive but none convincing to a buyer to opt for that solution . And that was exactly how the   investors were looking at it . And that made them skeptical and apprehensive about the marketability ,   sale - ability and sustainability of the solution . 

 As a strategy , based on my observations , I advised the entrepreneurs concerned to “ stop talking about   the technology and the features of their solution ” . 

 I asked them to help me find the answers to the following questions : 

 •   What is that “ one thing ” that is currently available to me , as a customer , which this solution will   make redundant ? 

 •   Why do I need this “ one thing ” ? 

 •   Would I face any difficulties if I do n’t get this “ one thing ” ? 

 •   Can this solution compensate for my “ loss ” ? 

 •   Can this solution add any value to my lifestyle ? 

 Once they were able to give me satisfactory answers to these questions , I helped them prepare their   pitch afresh focusing on the human elements like needs , wants , desire , social acceptance , failure and   success . A story that people can relate to and visualize . 

 This new approach helped them connect better with the investors and make the investors believe in   their vision and provide the much needed funding to get them off the blocks . 

 Today , the startup is in its growth phase , having recently secured its 7th round of funding . 

 Insight   This taught me a valuable lesson that our approach to solving a business problem should not be   restricted to the numbers but should also encompass the finer elements of the human beings involved   in or associated with that problem / solution . 

 <NAME>   Although I got positive responses with my approach that was used to solve this problem , I believe that   with the insights I got from this course would help me create a more structured , efficient and scalable   model of my approach .

"Applying Learning Launch into a real - life challenge 

 The Challenge 

 The challenge was to create a new food service concept for the consumer market and to test it out via a   learning launch . Naturally , the concept needed to capitalise on the then - current trends and demands of the   marketplace , and be profitable as well as implementable . The launch would be a pop - up restaurant in a   hipsterish - part of a capital city . 

 The Selection 

 Learning launch , pilot , prototype – it does n’t really matter what you call it , since the underlying principle   remains pretty much the same : trying out new ideas and concepts with real customers , getting real customer- feedback . Where <NAME> and <NAME> ’s learning launch differs slightly is in its emphasis on learning from the   experience , more effectively highlighting the iterative nature of design thinking . Be it a successful or a failed   launch , the main goal is to learn and hopefully take something away from the entire experience . 

 For this simple reason I chose the learning launch tool ( and the design thinking approach in general ) to address   my challenge . I wanted to use the launch as an opportunity to test new ideas , but also to learn from it and in   doing so improve my future output . The design thinking approach as a whole was also a step outside my usual   comfort zone and I saw it as a great opportunity for broadening my thinking and growing as a professional . 

 The Application 

 Based on primary data collected through observing and interviewing the people living in the area I would set   up my restaurant , I started drafting mind maps and journey maps . I then used these in a co - creative ideation   session I held with local participants . The ideation phase was super fruitful , and I found myself with an   abundance of interesting new ideas and concepts . Taking my personal capabilities as well as the specific   requirements of the location I would be holding my launch at in consideration , I selected one of the most   promising - sounding ideas : a takeaway restaurant serving porridge with customisable toppings ( think <NAME>   but with porridge instead of bread ) . 

 I then started developing an implementable menu around the chosen concept . Based on previous data , I   realised that my target audience appreciated healthy , organic , locally produced food , as well as customisability   and environmentally friendly cutlery + containers . Keeping all this in mind , I came up with my menu and finally   set up my pop - up food stall which would serve as my learning launch .   The launch itself was a great , buzzing   success , and on the first day I even ran out of food to serve – the local community seemed to love really what I   was offering ! 

 The Insight 

 I think the learning launch was a great way to test an idea with real customers . I got a lot of great feedback ,   which I ’m sure I ’ll be able to draw upon in my future work . 

 I have to say I was a bit sceptical of this approach at first , arrogantly thinking that “ I already know what my   customers want ” , based solely on my extensive experience in the industry .   Turns out I knew far less than I   thought I did – and after a few interviews with real people I started to understand the real value of involving   customers in the creation of new service concepts . Most importantly , it was delightful to see how super happy   the people involved in my project were to take part and many were even flattered to hear how much I valued   their input . And just like that , together we came up with a novel food service idea and it worked wonders !   What a great , fun , and educational experience overall and a brilliant way for identifying real - world needs and   finding solutions for them . 

 The ( future ) Approach 

 Next time I would probably dive headfirst into the design thinking process and leave my naïve doubts behind .   If I were to do this project again , I would have liked to involve customers even more , for example in the actual   menu creation stages to really nail down those flavour notes . Perhaps next time I ’ll set up ( or rent ) a test   kitchen to facilitate more involvement ! 

"Challenge 

 The challenge I present is a real case in which we applied the method of Design Thinking in its different   phases . Our users are people suffering from   Malaria in fairly advanced stage and to whom is performed a series   of treatments . This means carry a device through which the   medicinal product is delivered . This device has measures of 22 cm.x   10 cm . X 2.5 cm . ( Length x width x height ) and weighs 500 g. 

 The challenge that we were proposed was to raise ways to bring the medical device as   functional , comfortable and aesthetic for the patient ( men and women ) . 

 At the beginning of this phase of the project , we had 5 prototypes to test with patients . Each   prototype was very different in terms of : place of the body to be carried , way of subjecting , type of   fabric , accessory details . 

 With these 5 different prototypes , we should determine which worked and which did not , and for   those who worked what and how they should be improved . 

 Selection 

 With the range of possible proposals , our objective at this stage was to determine which were really   valid and could finally be real solutions to carry the medical device . Because patients can be male /   female and different age and physical states , we had to see if one product was enough to give as a   solution or we would validate different from them . 

 Learning Launch the tool is the best way to perform this test because we had groups of patients to   whom we could perform testing of prototypes .     Insights 

 At the beginning of the Learning Launch process we were unclear of how many rounds of testing   would be required . The application of the same process gave us the key . 

 In the meeting with patients and nurses held at the end of the first learning launch , we gave the   first clue of the prototypes to be dismissed ; They did not meet the functionality that should be   required . 

 In the second learning launch we tested the refined prototypes and got further feedback with   improvements to be made as on fabrics . 

 At the end of the third learning launch , we got four validated prototypes . 

 Application 

 The first learning launch was made with a group of 6 patients ( 3 men / 3 women ) of different ages and 

 different physical . 

 We arranged a meeting in which each patient was provided with a kit with 5 different prototypes   models with detailed explanation - how to carry , instructions , etc . - In this phase , nurses accompany   patients throughout the process , so questions or doubts could be solved . This test phase lasted a   month . At the end of the month we held a meeting with all patients to obtain feedback from each of   them . The conclusion of this first learning launch was to dismiss 2 prototypes and make   improvements in the remaining 3 . 

 We made a second learning launch with improved prototypes with another group of patients , following   the same process as before . At the end of the round , with the feedback obtained we refined the   prototypes . 

 Finally we considered a third learning launch with patients who were in the initial phase of introducing   the device , so they had no vices , as in former groups of patients we diagnosed sometimes were little   open to admit new ways to bring the apparatus because they were already used to a specific way . 

 At the end of this stage we got confirmation of 4 prototypes fully validated in terms of way to wear ,   fabrics , and accessories . 

 Approach 

 After the second learning launch , we did not give the phase concluded , because we questioned what   would happen to new patients with the device . Previous learning launch were conducted with   patients who had had time with the device which gave us the insight that they were people with vices   as to how to carry and less open minded for introducing different ways . 

 This gave us the key to the need for a third learning launch with new patients in the disease   because we made assumptions or assumed vices we had to contrast . 

 Future learning launch should get all range of different users from the beginning .

"Tool : Mind mapping 

 Elements : 

 1.Challenge : 

 We were given a project to define a problem at pediatrics department about vaccination . Then   solve this problem with designing a system or a product . To determine the problem our team   did observations at hospitals pediatrics . Then based on our observations and the data that we   collected from our observations , we gathered information . Then we share them among us .   Based on this information we had to determine the problems which we should work on . 

 2.Selection : 

 When all members shared their collected information , lots of actors , actions and cycles   detected at the whole process of vaccination system . At this stage in order to think all aspects   in our research and observations , we decided to use a detailed mind map . By this way we   would see the patterns and understand the relationships within system and find important   themes . 

 3.Application : 

 With all the collected information , our team had both qualitative and quantitative info . Then   we started to share the themes , actors and actions we find in the system ; member by member    ( For example : transportation of vaccines , cold chain , storage , vaccination ; nurse , parents ,   doctors , hospital workers ; informed , after effects , side effects , etc , ) . Every member writes and   sticks post - its onto a blank large paper . After that we organize them and group them by   themes and patterns . By this way we understand the pivot of our project 

 4.Insight : 

 There were lots of unrealized patterns between the actors and actions within system . And by   the use of mind mapping tool , our team define new themes and relations between elements .   So , it helped us to explore new patterns in system in vaccination . 

 5.Approach : 

 In our project we did not have the option to ask he stakeholders to examine the relationships   and finding themes . Consequently , the whole process is completed within our project   members . Therefore , our perception was not widened enough . But in order to define design   problem , the mind mapping tool was helpful to understand the patterns within vaccination   system in pediatrics .

"MINDMAPPING 

 CHALLENGE AND <ADDRESS> 

 The challenge is to increase the sales of my shop . So in order to think about that   we must first analyse the data which is already in our possesion . Ours is a watch   shop . Its main operations involve the sales and service of watches , clocks and   calculators . 

 Why am i choosing a mind map to analyse my current situation?Well a mind map   is an easy way to illustrate our ideas on a peice of paper . A mindmap is an excellent   tool to generate more ideas . We are going to start with our core idea that is our   watch shop and then we are going to develop that core idea to get an overall   perception about its functioning . So in hindsight this will allow us to pinpoint   where we need to improve and then we can focus on the measures we can take to   improve it.we believe the use of a mindmap will greatly aid us in this endeavor . 

 APPLICATION 

 We used the mind map to properly evaluate the shop as a whole.we started to   understand the situation as fundamentally as possible.we sat down and began to   brainstorm for all existing notions we had about the shop . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 Through the representation of the shop through a mind map it was noted that the   shop had some problems in marketing . We could clearly understand that the shop   urgently needed exposure digitally . So it was clear that one definite thing that   must be carried out is that the shop should have a clearcut online presence . 

 So the solutions we arrived at after the mindmapping session are the following : 

 • Use whatsapp , facebook and instagram to increase the shops online 

 presence . 

 • Upload content regularly to these social media . 

 • build social media following . 

 Through the adoption of these method steps in our plan we wereable to build a   sound online presence . We started getting more inquiries about our products and   services . It also is to be noted that the sales of the shop actually went up   approximately 40 % after the first three months .

"Visualization Reflection 

 Challenge     I work as a data disseminator and most of my problems can be solved by making lists or   through written or verbal communication . However , visualizations , even simple ones , have   helped me solve more complex problems . In this particular instance , I used a process flow   diagram to get approval for a multi - program process innovation .      Each month we disseminate international trade facts to the public . Some of these facts are in   the form of all time record highs and lows , for example , “ September imports from <ADDRESS> ( $ 50.0   billion ) were the highest on record . ” The process to create these facts used to be labor intensive   and was prone to human error . It involved visually scanning historical data tables against   current month values in order to determine whether the current month was a record . Because of   its manual nature , the process was a huge time sink . In addition , we would often release facts   with incorrect values , misspellings , or other errors ; any of which could have been easily   remedied with automation .      I envisioned a program that would output exact record wording , sentence and all . In order to do   this , I needed to automate the creation of each historical data point because the current manual   process was not in an easily accessible format for data analysis .   I planned to write historical   SAS programs for all of our historical data points : Real Dollar , End - use , Petroleum , Crude oil ,   and improve the country output . Then , I planned to write a main program that would pull in all   the historical data and provide the user with the finished record wording .   Beyond the obvious   hurdle of actually writing six new historical programs and one master program , I first needed   permission to go through with the process innovation .      Selection and Application     Initially , I approached the problem like I usually do by outlining my proposal in an email . I   included the relevant information of what changes were being made , estimated time to   completion , and the benefits of the innovation . However , I was n’t able to explain the idea in   enough detail .   I was still unsure how the end product would look and did n’t know where I would   get some of my data sources . I followed up with my manager and tried to discuss the idea in   person , but that was n’t making ground either . I was really passionate about the solution , but I   needed approval and backing because the creation of the historical tables was the responsibility   of my coworkers . I took a step back and realized I could n’t explain the innovation well . Even   verbally , it was still too abstract . I grabbed a scratch paper and sketched out a process flow   diagram . I circled each of the six data points and connected them with arrows , or spokes , to the   main hub program . Where I could , I added lines off of each data point , showing the location of   known data sources and earlier dependencies . From the main program I drew an arrow pointing   to a “ Record ” box , simulating the final output or record wording . 

 I presented this visualization to my manager at our next meeting . I could see I was making an   impact and the diagram was helping when she started to add to it . She wanted to make sure I   correctly captured the process timeline . We reorganized the program map , ordering the data   points according to when their data sources sources became available at each point in the   month .   She even filled in the rest of my missing data sources and added time period labels to   the data points(1994 - present , 2001 - present ) . Once the meeting was finished , we had completed   the diagram and I was granted approval for the project . I was effective because my   visualizations helped my manager understand what I was doing and persuaded her the value of   the project . I kept the diagram pinned at my desk and I even referred back to it when writing the   SAS programs . The diagram was not only a big help in getting approval , but it also helped me   map out the individual SAS programs .   Once completed , the project reduced the time required   to create record highlights and drastically reduced human error . It was a success .     Insight     Watching the visualization tool video in week one , I could really relate to the stick figure clip with   the thought bubbles . The presenter is explaining a shape and he is thinking of a triangle , but the   audience is thinking something different . One is imagining a circle , another is imaging a square ,   and a third is thinking of a star . It 's not until he draws a triangle that they are all on the same   page . Looking back to my historical program example , I can see that I had a picture of the   process in my head , but my words created a different picture for my manager . Once I applied   the tool of visualization , we were able to see the same diagram and move forward . This   example helped me realize that I often find it difficult to explain what is in my head in a   consumable way for others . Visualization can bridge that gap . Reflecting on the use of my   diagram and this class has shown and reinforced the power of visualizations .   The following   <NAME> <NAME> quote about communication embodies the insight I gained from this challenge .     “ In an environment where your , your ability to , to get things done and    to solve problems is dependent on other people being able to understand you and    align their ideas with yours . It 's really , it 's really important to be able to understand the way that    you communicate to people . ”     Approach   My use of a visualization to get approval was effective , but my approach could be improved . I   will definitely apply the tool of visualization again . For future problems , I will look to create   visualizations sooner and not add further confusion to a complex problem with overly detailed   emails . I would also like to further hone my visualization skills as part of the design thinking   process . I plan to practice using other mediums like PowerPoint or <ADDRESS> , as the   effectiveness of my communication is limited by my sketching ability . Simple diagrams may not   always work in the future . For larger issues , like those affecting multiple offices , I consider   employing the storytelling tool along with my visualizations . Some of my innovations involve   changing process across our division and creating a cause to unite people is a strong motivator   for change . Change is difficult and getting everyone on the same page is key .

"Reflection of Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection We have always told stories and they 're a vital part of our daily communication , but stories have meaning beyond entertainment value . Using storytelling often helps the audience to connect with you , so they trust you . I used to work with children age 7 to 12 and some of them are having a very low confidence and not willing to speak up . I often 

 told them stories based on my childhood or based on a book characters they could relate to and share with them stories that would open them up to share their feelings and thoughts . Sometimes , I would ask them to close their eyes and imagine themselves in the story path to build up their empathy to the character and eventually rejoice with the character ’s success at the end of the story . 

 Application I would always tread the story from their known point of view and journey them through the unknown . I would use different tones to 

 create the mood to keep their interest to the story . To get them to 

 open up or share their thoughts about the story shared , I some time would get them to write them down or draw a simple comic strips to express or share their thoughts about the story shared . 

 For those with low confidence children , I would make a big deal of their efforts and opinions shared so that they can feel good about themselves and have the confidence bar raised higher . We 

 always end the session with highlighting the kid 's effort and what more important is that the low confidence ones are feeling more accepted among their peer group , their friends . 

 Insight & Approach You would be surprised to see how these children would share their thoughts . I some time would get them to present their work 

 either write ups or comic strips with the rest of the class . To have the quiet ones to stand up in front of the group and to share their thoughts is a very tough challenge . One step at a time ; from being able to empathize with the character or the storyline and with the help and support from their friends , they would take a stand to share their work and express their thoughts and feelings .

"Visualization Assignment : 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 I am Divisional Sales Manager in a direct sales multinational organization . I 

 manage a big sales team in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> do Sul State , south of <ADDRESS> . Each member of my   team live in a different city . It is a big challenge to engage the team , drive for results and   works whit hard problems . We have one face - to - face meeting every quarter . My   challenge is work efficiently in this meetings to make clear the problem , the drive and   the activities for the team . 

 I have a specific challenge in the beginning of the year because at this time we 

 have sales order reduction and reseller activity reduction . It is happens because the   summer and vacations time in <ADDRESS> . The reseller is an autonomy activity like an   entrepreneur . With the visualization approach , I can achieve a shared understanding of   this problem and after identify and define possible solutions to this challenge .   Stimulating the creativity thinking and new solution and approach , we disrupted the   status quo to achieve a new and better sales order KPI in this beginning of 2009 . 

 Application : 

 I scheduled a special meeting to working in this challenge . Was 23 sales managers 

 working hard . I started the process making clear the problem . With the shared   understanding and opportunity to all stakeholders , contribute . 

 The problem is : Sales order reduction and reseller activity reduction 

 I wanted to make they confront you justification of do not send order by reseller 

 whit the reason to send order by reseller . Therefore , I make a brainstorm approach .   First , they has to think about the reasons of the resellers do n’t send your order . Each   participant spoke one reason to do not send order . One after the other repeatedly until   each participant do not having more reasons to speak . This step took approximately 2   hours . During this process , I drawing a chart in the whiteboard with all do not send   reasons spoke in the brainstorm . Then we identify overlap reasons and grouped reasons   that we can understanding as the same . In the end of this process , we have the clear   and sharing understanding of the reseller reasons to do n’t send your order . 

 After that , I repeat exactly the some process but with the reseller reason to send , 

 your order . So , I confronted the stakeholders mind trough the difference brainstorms   and difference customer empathy required for this exercise . 

 With the two reasons charts to send and do n’t send the order , I split the group 

 in two . Each group , take the half of reseller reason to do n’t send the order and drew in 

 the chart a based proposal on reseller reason to send the order drew in the specific chart   precisely . Next , I confronted the concepts again . The groups presented your proposal to   other group and the viewer group , make considerations about presentation . It was   repeated until there are no more consideration in both of groups . 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 This was a great experience . I learned a lot , like how we can confront the ideas 

 and team mindset about repetitive challenges . How whit the chart drew with all inputs   and all stakeholders we reinforcing the understanding trough the sharing vison about   the problem and the real motivations . That ’s incredible how we know the options and   solution , but we need the coordinated and propitious environment to innovate trough   all knowledge that we already have as an individual , but as a group , its happen . With the   visualization trough the charts , we work with focal point and stimulated the right side   of ours brain . We engaged the team as a part of solution , and not like a problem . When   all stakeholders are part of solution , they really working hard for the success of this   process and fallowing . 

 As a feedback of the process of visualization , in the next opportunity I will use 

 more the visualization tool asking to each participant make a draw and collage about   the challenge and/or solution proposal . So , I can gain more insights and rich variances   about the challenge and the individual creativity 

 Now , I use the visualization tool with frequency and I fell the results on the team 

 and I have very good feedback about the tool and the new approach in the mettings .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Period End Closing Calendar Standardization in Asia Market 

 Challenge    I am a member of my organization ’s Record to Report ( R2R ) general ledger department or also   known as R2R GL and my challenge is to improve the workflow activities and projects ) within   department in order to make every activity to be efficiently and effectively so we can save more   time and focus on other project for development purpose . In this department , we have one   activity named as Period End Closing Calendar ( <NAME> <NAME> ) which used for closing activities   time schedule so each department can know when is the deadline time for each activity . The   purpose of this project is to standardize layout , format , and description activities for Period End   <NAME> <NAME> ( <NAME> <NAME> ) in all <ADDRESS> market .     The project scope includes R2R GL team which consist of 3 employees ( analyst , senior analyst ,   and supervisor ) , as well as R2R Fixed asset department , with whom we work closely . The project   should not exceed 2 months period and the solution should include an even distribution of   working hours amongst the team members . The goals are to uncover what our GL team and also   other team which work closely with us consider to be ineffective or problematic with regard to   the layout , description list of Period End Closing Calendar ( <NAME> <NAME> ) .     Selection   Our team has already gone through several checking on the old version of <NAME> <NAME> that we   usually used and took a look on which are lacking and still not standardized so can cause   confusion to other team who use this PEC calendar . After those checking , we ’ve already figured   out what need to be updated and standardized , so our team are ready to try the learning launch   tool . Broadly speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea and   prototype .     Application      For our first learning launch , we focused on the structure and layout of Period End Closing   <NAME> ( <NAME> <NAME> ) for each market in <ADDRESS> . Thus we need to collect data of PEC calendar   from each market then summarize all of PEC to one file . From this summary file , we found out   many of those activities are similar to one another which is quite not so efficient and not effective .     For our second learning launch , in particular , we wanted to see if we could structure our task   code , task description , and who the person responsible with to be standardized for all of <ADDRESS>   market . We try to combine some of activities which similar one another in some markets to   summarize them in one new standardize activity so no need to have a lot of line activities in PEC   calendar schedule . Our project team went through around two weeks to summary those similar   activities .   Next , we confirmed to each market whether we can structure those activities into one   line activity which can be described the same meaning . This crosscheck with each market   happened around one week timeframe to complete before we decided the final draft . We 

 expected to produce a document with a clear description of our new properly and effectively PEC   calendar schedule .   For our third learning launch , we also focus on confirming the list of activities on PEC calendar   that already standardized to other team such as R2R Fixed Asset team . Since some of those   activities mostly related with fixed asset team so we need to confirm if they are already agree   with the new standardization that we try to propose . The review from R2R Fixed Asset team   required around one week timeframe , then the PEC calendar sent back to our team for some   revises and ask for final confirmation to Fixed Asset team .     After the draft for standardization PEC calendar ready , we conducted a socialization to all senior   analyst which handled <ADDRESS> market . On this step , we want to share the latest version of   standardization PEC calendar to all of the senior which is responsible as the person in charge who   make this period end closing calendar for each market . From this presentation , we explained   about what the background is , how we do the standardization , and what we improve by doing   this . Our team also ask the senior analysts to recheck once again the latest version of PEC   calendar and give feedback to us if there anything to be added or revised to be adapted according   to each market situation . We give them one week time for checking and rereview and we ’ll get   back to them after three days time doing the revision . In case there are some new activities or   changes , feel free for other department or PIC from each market to contact us through mail .     Insight    By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified that our assumptions to standardize   naming convention and template for Period End Closing calendar in <ADDRESS> market has been   successfully implemented . Person in charge for each market find this standardization project to   be useful and more effective and efficient . This approach died improve our workload and save   more time because we have one Period End Closing Standard which already standardized so all   <ADDRESS> market can use same code task and description and do n’t cause any confusion to affiliate   and other department . Our actual results were slightly different from what we anticipated , since   sometimes still there are some revision from other team , while our team was open to any   improvement to make the PEC calendar easier to use . Moving forward , our team will review all   of suggestions and try to make it better or expand the same standardization approach for other   market outside <ADDRESS> .     Approach   Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking tools and we found it the   learning launch is the appropriate tool . As mentioned , our team needs to review the insight   gained from our current project and using this insight into future launch designs . Future launch   designs should reflect insight gained , progress made , and come to a better version workflow .

"My   Reflection – Storytelling by <NAME> <NAME>     Challenge & Selection      Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences . ... Storytelling can   be used as a method to teach ethics , values and cultural norms and differences .   Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide   authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied .     Story telling has been my choice because I work with people with special and huge   vulnerability status . I work with children if I can call it like this who went against   the law . I am helping in their correctional , changing behavior in order to   reintegrate their family and society in general . Many of these people deal with   cruelty and disfunction in every aspect of their lives , they need to be heard   corrected and helped in their daily life . Sometimes they are depressed in one and   other kind . I spend a lot of time “ opening people up ” and finding ways to inspire   them to improve their situations . They are lonely separated with their family and   friend and sometimes felt happy and in their way to get well in sharing their story .   They arrive to understand what they did wrong and ready to be corrected and be an   example to others . From other ’s story they visualize a state of healing and process   of not recidivism on their life mistake .   With this experience I develop strategies to find a way of reintegrate those children   to the life they real deserve to have and gain back their home safely .      I was also explaining how sometimes addressing the needs of one individual can   impact everyone for the better , even if it seems extreme or out of the ordinary . I   told a story of 3 young children studying at recognized school but who did not   know that parents should give a small time which can be there to discuss with their   children . They got all thing than kid can desire but missed a lot in their life . In time   they went in boarding they decide to put fire in dormitory and judged and got 2   years in Correctional Services . They have been considered as criminal no one   wanted to talk to them .       Insight & Approach     As those children isolated themselves to other group , I took the opportunity to put   them in groups after lunch time and prepare them to an interesting story . I told 

 them how everyone is claimed to be innocent when he / she does n’t understand well   the gravity of his action until s / he saw well their action . I told them how King   <NAME> took another ’s wife and kill his husband in order to cover what he did . I   asked them was it good to do all that evil thing ? I associated that story with my   own one . When I was at their age , I liked to have all attention to me . I was   somehow selfish and not considering other . I told them how I was miserable as I   wanted everything to be mine , not sharing with other . That lead me to be always   lonely hated by my sibling and realizing how other were united I promised myself   to change . I started to take care of other and that costed me a lot for them to believe   me . They followed attentively and at the end everyone said the was thinking those   children were like an evil himself and I showed them that everyone is there   because s / he did something wrong so there were no need to add on this and showed   that they have to take a time to remember of what they did in order to hate it and   not doing it again . At the time they start consider each and everyone as a brother   and a sister and every time they do have a different , they remember I told them to   be tolerated one another .       When I reported what happened to my superior , they were happy and told me to   elaborate a plan on how to have like a discussion twice a week with those children ,   because of the positive impact telling story had on them . This course helped and   strengthened me a lot about this tool . Now I always have a time to put together   their stories , and customize them ; to share with them and take a good decision   from what they have as an experience .     Another interesting thing comes from that story is now when parents come to visit   their incarcerated children , we give them a counsel to try to have a time to discuss   with their children as even if they can give them everything nothing can not replace   the time they spent with their children .     From that time , I can not miss any occasion to take and customize my story to reach   the heart of those children and the result is amazing .

"Challenge : 

 The work which I am going to discuss here is ‘ Healthcare status in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ’ .   I 

 wanted to know what the Influential factors that determine the healthcare status of any landscape 

 are ; in this case I have taken a village called <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> - <ADDRESS> . It is a village with almost 

 every resident ’s income level is below poverty line . The healthcare status of the region of course 

 was poor . So , It was quite easy to attribute the income level is the reason for their low healthcare 

 concerns . And it was quite reasonable to belief that also . But , while doing this Design Thinking 

 course , I started to think in a different way . I wanted to study deep into it and reason it out , i.e. I 

 wanted to confirm / disconfirm it that family income is / is not the key factor / only key factor in 

 deciding the healthcare status . That is the challenge I was onto . And I was seeking design 

 thinking tools to help me solve this . 

 Selection : 

 The Design thinking tool that I wanted to employ here is <NAME> <NAME> . The reason 

 I chose learning launch is that I basically wanted to test / experiment few ideas . I wanted to either 

 confirm / disconfirm an ideology / belief in that region and what else could help me testing an idea 

 other that learning launch . 

 Application : 

 At first launch , my thinking was quite narrow as to confirm / disconfirm the idea that 

 income is the prime indicator of healthcare status . I decided to interview people in that village so 

 as to collect data . The hypothesis here was , ‘ Income is not the only factor that decides the 

 healthcare ’ and I designed a questionnaire based on the pilot interviews to test this hypothesis . 

 The factors that influence healthcare were assumed ( Key Assumptions / hypothetically observed ) 

 to be Drinking Water Quality , Sanitation Facility , Health Education and Awareness , Occupation 

 status - Income and Health Expenditure . 

 At Second launch , I went out to collect exhaustive data for the analysis . While collecting 

 data , I was quite open for a surprising factor that has an influential impact on the healthcare 

 status . This ensured me that I was aware of my confirmation bias and I was more open for the 

 reality . The data were processed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Studies ) to test 

 the hypothesis . The result of the hypothesis test will give me the confirmation / disconfirmation of 

 the conceived notion that income is the only factor that decides the healthcare status of a region . 

 This is how I applied the design thinking tool - Learning Launch to test / experiment my idea 

 Insight : 

 By applying the Learning launch tool for testing my idea / Assumptions , It was observed 

 that the income status of the region is not the prime reason for the poor healthcare exhibit of the 

 village . The factors which I assumed such as Sanitation facility , Health Education also played 

 their parts ( with the help of Factor Analysis ) . Thus <NAME> <NAME> provided me the basement 

 where I can go on and test my idea . And to my surprise , it also helped me in unveil one more 

 factor that plays a role in deciding the healthcare status of a village : Geographical influence and 

 the industrial density . These <NAME> that popped out of this design thinking exercise , I believe , 

 will be very useful for those rural community - thanks to Design Thinking . 

 Approach : 

 Based on these insights , I believe I need to still dig deep into each factor in the same way 

 I begun . A quick recap , I began this to check if income is the only factor and then assumed few 

 other factors and tested my hypothesis . In the same way , I will be taking each and every above 

 tested factor individually and I will test those factors ( ideas related to those factors ) , in the future 

 launches . This exercise , I believe , will bring on so many other considerations as far as healthcare 

 is concerned and that will surely benefit the society . 

 This exercise can also be done with the help of mind mapping , where when I was doing 

 interview , I could have the made the candidates picture out their mind . And after that I could 

 have done the analysis part of those charts collected from the candidates . The challenge I felt 

 with this method was the literacy of the audience . The subjects were rural people and to be frank , 

 most of the people I interviewed were n’t good enough in writing and that makes this tool 

 difficult for a rural population , which is why I chose the Learning Launch tool . Thanks for the 

 flexible range of Design thinking tools .

"The purpose of a learning launch is to learn . If you learn valuable information , the learning   launch is a success , whether the particular idea is validated or not .        Challenge & Selection    Learning Launch is a important tool . We had corporate product Equipajemobil which satisfy the   needs of corporate customers . With this service monitoring mobile field team was the   first aim . Altough we satisfy the tracking need , we realize that corporate customer    wanted to assign task to their field employees , and track the completion of the task .    So we decided to test our Hypothese that corporate customer wants to   track their   business .     Application    We used learning launch tool . Discussing with our corporate customers , we have   noticed that   the the main focus for the company was task tracking .   We have this idea we have to test .   Most learning launches involve figuring out what customer need . İf customer is going to buy our   answer to that need . And our learning launches involve getting out there and talking to   customers , very , very quickly . And We are going to go a little quickly til we get up to the process   to show . 

 Knowing their employee location was a value , but it does n’t tell the owner if their team    complete the task assigned . Team tracking had a meaning by task tracking . Testing has   shown   so   our product is build on business tracking .     Insight & Approach      By   use of mobile application , our product   had a new value proposition which satisfy the   corporate needs . Corporate users   are involved in digital platforms . Mobile application helps   the company to digitalize their process . They track their business via app . Our product   <NAME> had a strong value proposition it is not only tracking people , it is tracking   business .      Learning launches are a methodology for testing ideas to determine which qualify as   business opportunities . Learning launches are a methodology for testing ideas to determine   which qualify as business opportunities . We have tested our idea and move to a new   application .

"Challenge     I was working as a Diploma Programme ( DP ) Mathematics Educator at an International   Baccalaureate ( IB ) Organisation . I had a very differentiated set of students in my class . I had   observed students ​struggling with mathematics in spite of their motivation , sound mathematical   knowledge , and explicit instructions delivered to them . There could have been various reasons   behind the challenge like erroneous recall of arithmetic facts , difficulty in representing mathematical   concepts etc . ​DP mathematics courses serve to accommodate the wide range of needs ,   interests , and abilities of students . Keeping all these things in mind , introducing a new topic in   class ( Geometric Series ) through just chalk and talk method did not seem like a convincing idea .     Selection     It is a common belief that stories can be used to teach mathematics to primary school students   but not for high school students . However , stories are a powerful cognitive tool that can help in   providing meaning to seemingly irrelevant facts , methods , and algorithms . The purpose of   storytelling in a math class is to create an environment of imagination along with thinking , to   make mathematics more enjoyable for students , to help them understand ideas and concepts ,   and to bring a ​moment of relaxation to the class​.     Historical anecdotes can often be woven into teaching and math is rooted in history since time   immemorial , offering enough opportunities for storytelling . We can even engage students in   mathematical activities through storytelling .     Application     Students are already familiar with “ word problems ” . To effectively use word problems in a high   school math classroom , they need to be reconstructed a bit . To introduce Geometric Series and   make the students derive its formula by themselves in class , I decided to infuse word problems   with dynamic characters and plots , that is , come up with a story . To make it even more   engaging for the students , I also decided to have the students perform a paper cutting activity   with this and make them translate words into abstract equations .   The story went like this : There was a king who had a son , who used to pester him to give him   the land owned by the king . The king was in a critical situation and decided to give the land but   according to some rules . The king told him that he only had a square piece of land and he would   give half of that on the first day , half of what he gave the previous day on the second day and so   on . After doing so for many days , how much of land would his son have ?    Students went on to find the answer to that question using the square papers they had . They   folded the square in half into two equal triangles ( one such triangle was what the son got on the   first day ) . They again folder the other triangle into two equal halves , cut them out and kept one   of the new triangles as the son ’s share for the next day . They realised that the king can do this   forever but he would still have a small triangle left with him . So the son can never get the whole   land ! 

 Insight      The storytelling discussed here took the form of a structured activity in the class . ​Students were   able to summarize the solution to the problem . It helped my students unearth the symbolic   nature of verbal strategies . My students discovered that the sum of infinite such triangles would   be 1 . They were able to come up with the sum of an infinite geometric series own their own , all   of which started with a story .      The students will look forward to reading more such ‘ stories ’ in math classes and try finding   solutions to the mathematical problems embedded within . I discovered that storytelling is a   productive tool for teaching the subject , it even provides a sense of giving beyond the subject   content .     .​Approach     I had incorporated several design thinking tools or activities in my math class and found   storytelling as an effective instructional tool . It is important to review the insights gained from the   application of this tool and incorporate them into future storytelling sessions .     I shared this story with my colleagues ( IB educators from various disciplines ) and it had a   profound effect on their classroom teaching as well . I would further encourage the use of   storytelling as a starting point for a series of mathematical activities in class .

"Challange & Selection 

 I ’m a Senior Brand Manager at leading telecommunication company in <ADDRESS> . I will explain   our company ’s e - commerce platform with storytelling method . 

 As a leading telecommunication company that ’s always worked to bring the innovations of   mobile communications to <ADDRESS> , PopEi has long prioritised investment in innovative   marketing tactics . Recently a new challenge emerged : PopEi wanted to use the latest   digital tools to identify customers who were close to churn and then find ways to regain their   loyalty . 

 The primary aim was to improve marketing campaigns . PopEi could n’t identify the intent   of those searching ‘ change GSM service provider ’ to understand if they were an existing   customer looking for a new provider or someone looking to switch to PopEi from a   competitor . 

 Application 

 To solve this problem , hype set up a custom data integration that linked together internal   CRM data , Google Analytics and <NAME> . These tools and the integration between them   enabled the team to distinguish PopEi customers from their rivals ’ . After storing data such   as roaming plan type or PopEi loyalty membership status in Google Analytics , they used   this data to create new audience segments , then identified those who were seeking services   from competitors and used <NAME> to target each audience segment with tailored offers . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The approach meant that PopEi could not only distinguish between those who were   already customers and those who were not , but could also target consumers who were   closest to converting with customised messaging . The results far surpassed expectations .   <NAME> was able to decrease cost per acquisition by 78 % , cut cost per click by 61 % and   increase conversions by 36 % . We knew the integration would increase the campaign   performance , but we were surprised by the significance of the improvement .      It ’s no longer a matter of whether we have enough data anymore ; data is available in many   different platforms . Now it ’s a matter of how we can make these platforms talk to each   other . This is what we achieved with Google Analytics – creating custom remarketing   audiences and using them in <ADDRESS> . With conversions doubled and costs reduced by 78 % ,   we ’re continuously looking for ways to achieve even more .

"Design Thinking and Innovation    A Bike Seat Belt 

 By <NAME> 

 <NAME> 

 Challenge and Section 

 A Bike seat belt ? . Yes you heard that right . The challenge I have taken is usually the 

 common struggles faced by Motor - cycle riders across the globe . I have gathered all info 

 related to it and found that there are no possible solutions for motor - cycle riders from 

 skidding problems , sudden brake jumps and related struggles . I mean the struggle is real ! . 

 This can be revolutionary ad - on to a motor - bike . The tool which I have included is the 

 Visualization Tool ​because I have done <NAME> designing since a year . So I feel it is cool 

 doing stuff such as visualizing and drawing . 

 Application : 

 The main idea in the process is to create a seat - belt kind of thing which provides the 

 support to the maximum to the people who ride the motorcycle . We all know that cars have 

 these seat belts to protect the person who is riding and people who travel along with 

 him / her . We apply the same concept for bikes also but for a small change it would be 

 clubbed to the legs of the person who rides the motor - bike and the person who travels 

 along with him / her . We do n’t make a tight club with the legs of the people so that he / she 

 does n't feel   uncomfortable when driving and switching gears . The belts tighten only during 

 application of sudden brakes . The above portrayed illustration shows how the belts are tied 

 up with the person . The advantages of this are : 

 1 ) Less damage to the rider than normal skidding 

 2 ) Sudden application of brakes prevent flipping of the person from the bike 

 3 ) The belt does not hold up thighs so tight and less - expensive to implement . 

 This can probably be designed in all bikes . The Stakeholders here would be common 

 people , bike - riders , etc . 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that this tool is 

 highly efficient . I have done collaborative research and found it really helpful to solve the 

 problem .   Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and 

 learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of 

 design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their combined 

 feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their work .

"Reflection 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Our department is involved in and provides the secretariat for numerous interdepartmental 

 committee and working groups , many of which have a similar membership .   These forums have been 

 individually established to help us progress work across government and have evolved in direction . 

 As we have limited resources , we need an efficient and effective way of ensuring we meet our 

 stakeholder ’s expectations and achieve our objectives . 

 We had gathered information about our working groups and committees , the resources involved in 

 servicing these forums and our aims for the coming year .   We wanted to identify and develop an 

 agreed set of priorities , so we could potentially rationalise or streamline these forums , focus our 

 efforts and be more effective and efficient . 

 I chose mind mapping ( <NAME> 3 ) to help us quickly work through the vast amount of information 

 and develop an agreed view about our current state , before trying to identify a way forward ( What 

 if ) . 

 Application 

 We gathered all the information we had about the forums , including their membership , purpose , 

 scheduling , programs of work and expected lifespan .   I transformed an office into an information 

 booth displaying it through a mix of mediums such as Post - it notes , whiteboards , butchers paper , 

 calendars and handmade posters . 

 <ADDRESS> , staff , and managers were invited to the information booth , given coloured dots and 

 asked to identify the forums that helped progress or inform their work created work or lacked 

 relevancy to their projects . They were then invited to write down one thing they valued and wanted 

 from a forum that currently did not exist . 

 While the information booth concept worked , some people were confused about the purpose of the 

 exercise , and the office we chose to set up in was not big enough for people to move around as 

 freely as we would have liked . 

 Insights 

 Through mind mapping , we identified a range of strategies to help link the work across forums , 

 reduce duplication of effort ( both in servicing forums and for members of the forums ) .   We were 

 also able to decrease the number and frequency of forums , by establishing smaller self - servicing 

 committees . 

 Also , the mind mapping exercise identified a disconnect between our priorities and the work of one 

 of the committees , which we have now been able to address . 

 Most importantly , this was the first time many had participated in mind mapping .   All agreed the 

 design thinking approach had facilitated a rich conversation that had enabled us to identify and 

 agree on shared priorities that would allow us to take our work to the next level , with the hope of 

 achieving improved results , and had broader application in government . 

 Approach 

 The exercise was extreamly powerful and would use mind mapping again .   Next time , I would display 

 the information differently as some participants found it a little chaotic , and due to the size of the 

 office , it was harder to engage with than I would have liked .   I would also brief participants on 

 arrival , so they were clearer on what we were trying to achieve to avoid confusion and make it a 

 safer experience for people to share their views and concerns .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 Design Tool : VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I have decided to choose is Visualization , Visual Thinking as I prefer to call it .   I consider this tool can be helpful to count on the whole picture of the problem I am working on , in   the initial steps of the design thinking process . With it , I can support my effort to identify in the most   accurate basis , the pain point I intend to solve . 

 Visualization helps me to make the people pay attention to what is going on ( What is ? ) by examining   what already exists . Visual thinking as a tool , guides my group , organizes it , leads the people to   discover the outcome desired . 

 As the first approach to the innovation process , this tool unlocks my thinking , unleashes creativity as   well as improves the way I communicate my ideas to the people I work with . 

 By using visual elements like charts and graphs , I provide an accessible way to see and understand   trends , outliers , and patterns in data and discover possibilities I have not seen yet . 

 Application 

 In my company , I am the manager of an area called Responsible Care . I usually work together with   my team , so this tool allows me to approach , identify , organize and communicate more effectively   the ideas within the group . The tool represents information visually , so it can be learned quickly and   easily . 

 I find it helpful to focus on the idea and guide my team members to the outcome I am looking for . By   this tool , I can communicate effectively the situation , and I challenge the people to explore the   problem , think possible scenarios and present prospect solutions for the outcome I am trying to   reach . 

 As I said above , I use charts and graphs , I can make a development of my concept and make it   visible for the group , the abstract idea becomes visible for them because it is expressed more   clearly . 

 Insight & Approach 

 With the knowledge I have gained throughout this course , I have imagined a better way of working   with my group , co - working all together to achieve more effectively the solution we are all looking for . 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 new ways of working with visualization , adding posts to my initial diagram with ideas and   suggestions which arise from the discussions between the team members , grouping the ideas   according to the different criteria as a second step , and then finally vote for those which look more   representative of the solution we are seeking . 

 I recognize that the value added to the group by being aligned in the same direction , considering first   all the different ideas presented by each of the members , can strengthen us as a team , organize   information in a better way and keep all focused to achieve the results .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I am work as marketing manager in my organization 's marketing department and   we have challenge to adapt a large event ( 4 g cinema ) that was held in a big city   ( more than 1,000,000 people ) and now we need hold it in a small city . The project   is limited to internal resources ( i.e. , budget and employee time ) . 

 Selection 

 When we start our workflows , we always focus on bringing the idea to life with a   visualization tool and this case was no exception . Our team use this tool at all stages   of the workflow to achieve a common understanding of the problem among a   diverse group of stakeholders , to make sense of our observations , to capture new   concepts and make them tangible . 

 Application 

 First , we looked at the original federal project toolkit , analyze it using sketches on   the whiteboard . This approach helped our group quickly come to a common   decision that we need to move away from the recommendations of the federal   toolkit for our project and offer our own version of the solution for choosing a place   for an event and filling it . Due to for our conclusion , we decided to look for a ready- made venue in the city that would satisfy our need .      Then we needed to find ideas to filling of our event to showcase our company as   modern and innovative . We 've done our exploration activities of our potential   visitors to solve this problem . For our research , we used the photos of our   subscribers in order to try to understand them .    As a result , we 've created personas which exemplified certain attributes our users .   This helped us to understand their and choose the most relevant event content   such as virtual reality techniques , 360 photo booth with the ability to post photo   to Instagram and etc . 

 Insight & Approach 

 In the process of working on a project , we learned how to use visualization tool at   every stage of our project work . Especially is it a very useful tool in the begin , when 

 you do not know what to start . Due to by applying the visual tool , our team   simplified team collaboration and easy to generated excitement for new ideas . 

 Now I completely agree that Visualizing new possibilities , or current realities , as   vividly as possible contributes to our ability to execute change successfully .   Beginning with the end in mind , visualizing the possibilities as clearly as we can be   a powerful aid in the innovation process .

"Reflection Learning - Launch 

 Challenge 

 I was appointed the brands and communication Team lead of my organization , a non- governmental organization where I was saddled with the responsibility of Making the local   organization programs and projects visible to the global world in due time . 

 Selection 

 Myself and my team got expose to some design thinking tools , the learning lunch tool happened   to the best fit for what needs to be achieved as it speaks to quick test of an idea and prototype 

 Application 

 Our first learning launch was to first arrange how we want to go about the online visibility then   what we need to push out for audience to see , then when do we want then to see it , majorly   focusing on using scrum process ( like Trello that shows task to be done , the one in progress   and the one that has be done ) in a way of been agile . This to check our arrangement to see if   that is the main cause of the challenge . We engage in a performance and project management   profession for three days training for better understanding , Then we go through one   week of   workshops to structure   out given tasks and processes to conform in a more agile way . All this   was done with few weeks and the outcoming gave us a clearer part of what needs to be done   that was n’t done 

 For our second learning Launch tool , we focused on what and how content gets to us and how   we go   about the project and programs of the organization in order to gain clarity on what   exactly is the challenge that usually makes it looks like we are n’t visible . This test our   assumption that our means and kind of content is the main challenge of our visibility , after   completion of survey , the Stakeholder get to know that the kind of content given to us to   publicize is not the kind of content needed by our audience which usually pulls them off our   pages most of the time . 

 Insight 

 Through the application of learning launch , Our team gets to test our assumptions and also   think through the anticipated result , to find out the approach that best solves the challenge at   hand . At the end both the team and the stakeholder see things differently in the sense that , the   way of dispatching content to the team was changed as it was identified that its one of the major   issues affecting the visibility and the approach of publicizing too was changed to a more agile   way . 

 Approach 

 It is obvious that   Learning launch is the right tool for the task at hand as it gives room for quick   tests , now our team can work on the insight gain in = order to enhance smooth visibility of the   local organization .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling     challenge & Selection          Exposing to other is a simple and a complex way we should go with storytelling for a   simple way . I deal with vulnerable populations , developmentally disabled individuals , senior   citizens , and economically disadvantaged people but I noticed others which may not be   compared to them but very noticeable to see that have a depression after travelling not   accepting how to go back with their lives . Many of these people deal with oppression and   dysfunction in every aspect of their lives surely , also they need to be empowered and   inspiration is a path to empowerment . I spend a lot of time “ opening people up ” and finding   ways to inspire them to improve their circumstances . When I work with seniors , we share   stories for different reasons . Often they 're lonely and are so happy to share stories of their   lives with me to connect and they find meaning in sharing these experiences as a form of   teaching and/or legacy , in a sense . With my developmentally   clients I share stories of my   life in order to help them visualize a state of independence , I use their feedback against the   context of my story to ascertain their goals , and sometimes we use stories to better   understand their interests and thought processes . I use this information to develop different   strategies to try and find a way that works for them to gain more independence in the areas   they find lacking in their lives .      Application    I have a story about using storytelling . I was also explaining how sometimes addressing the   needs of one individual can impact everyone for the better , even if it seems extreme or out   of the ordinary . I told a story about when I ran an emergency shelter after a natural disaster .   Everyone was doing really well except for one girl whose stress was making her very   emotionally volatile . I could tell she needed attention ; in my mind I decided she would be   the day girl to hang out and talk . We went for a cup of coffee and sat down with her and let   her talk . It turned out to have a problem in life with her family and friends , she is not able to   communicate back . 

 Insight & Approach   Well , after a long talk and more listening , that was an eye - opener . Her mother was a calm   presence and doing very well . Clearly it was time for me to open up with my story . I told her   how scary it was when I had doubts communicating in front of people for the first time and   how difficult and scary that all was . I shared how I used of meeting new people and make   myself in new circles , and then tied us together , by noting how she and I both have same   kind of feelings . This worked really well . She really needed individual attention for that brief   time , and she ended up with that and a true support . She calmed down , her mother , who   had become worried about her , calmed down , and everyone around them calmed down .   Peace reigned again . Sometimes a little story can do a lot of good . This course made me see   this as a tool in a new way . When I 've done it before it was really "" ad hoc , "" but now I can   prepare ahead and think of stories that will assist me in presenting my ideas and best 

 illuminate them . I have a design background , but I ended up as an entrepreneur in business .   I had no idea this would ever be considered an asset , but I am so very grateful that it is !

"Reflection - Learning Launch 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I am a member of a small mobile app entrepreneur venture team .   We are developing a mobile app for   personal use .    Our challenge is to increase the sales of the app and to expose the app to wider   audiences . The team resources were limited . It included three sw engineers for the app development   while the marketing aspect of was relying on the mobile phone company ’s infrastructure for app   deployment and advertisement which was basically the search engine of the <NAME> <NAME> .   The feature and   requirement of the app was based on developers ’ personal needs and use cases .   Although there were   many similar mobile apps in the <NAME> <NAME> , our app presented some uniqueness such as the special way   for user password entry , data backup to personal computer via Wi - Fi connection and a “ closed ” app   with no back channel connection to external websites for security reasons . 

 Early the development cycle , we had decided to provide the basic features so that we could shorten the   time to marketing / sales duration , and experiment the features that we provided . 

 The mobile app had gone through three month testing within the team members and friends who   volunteered to be real users .   The features of the app were based on what we knew best for the users .    As it turned out , our app introductions were aligned with the learning launch methodology described in   this class . 

 Application 

 The primary focus of the first Learning Launch was to gather the results for the app deployment , basic   functionalities and software bugs .   We wanted to use this launch to ensure that we comply with all   stringent requirements and Infrastructure of the App Store , collected software bug reports , and ensured   all the functions worked as designed .   We used the app reviews in the <NAME> <NAME> for user feedback and   comments . 

 The goal for second Launch was to introduce the new features based on our “ what we know best ”   assumptions for the password entry method and Wi - Fi data backup .   In addition , we wanted to gain   insights of how the app attracted a wider users and perhaps globally since the data for global regional   sales was provided by the App store for developers . 

 Insights 

 The result of the learning launches gave us valuable info for the product introduction as well as some   unexpected surprises . 

 The first launch was successful as intended because it allowed us to collect the software issues reported   by users and fixed them for the second launch .   This fulfilled our goal to introduce our first mobile app   to the world . 

 In the second launch , we found out that our unique design for password entry turned out to be too   cumbersome to the users and the feedback was that users got frustrated and give up .   In addition , the   Wi - Fi backup procedure was too complicated to use because it required users to follow restrict   instruction and had to connect to a personal computer for data storage .   The global regional sales data   showed that the app was downloaded globally and the heaviest traffic was in the <ADDRESS> regions . 

 Approach 

 Our overall conclusion of using the learning launch that it is a very valuable methodology .   Based on the   feedback provided by the users , we are planning on the third launch which allows us to improve the   mobile app by adding the new features such as providing a regular alphanumeric pad for password   entry , utilizing the localization service for the mobile phone for Chinese , Japanese , & Korean languages ,   taking advantage of the new cloud backup function in mobile app . 

 This is by no mean that the third learning launch will be the end of the app product release cycle .   We   plan to use the methodology for all future rollout .

"Everyone enjoys a good story . Telling a good story , however , is n’t as easy at it seems . It takes dedication to the craft , a willingness to learn and understand the different elements and techniques , and a heck of a lot of practice . Regardless of genre or style , however , all good stories have six common elements . When developing your next narrative work , make sure you ’re paying careful attention to all of these . 

 STORIES ARE ALL AROUND US 

 Most of us would fondly remember story time as a small child , or perhaps we now share stories with our own children and watch as they take delight in the twists and turns of their favourite picture book . We tell our friends stories at work , over dinner and drinks and , later , maybe we relay those stories again to new audiences . Humans live in stories every day and dream in stories all night long . We are all storytellers and story listeners . 

 While every story is different , a successful one 

 captivates its audience and inspires an emotional response . As humans , we love to be entertained , and storytelling is universally accessible . Learning to craft a compelling story by engaging an active audience is the art of storytelling .

"DESIGN THINKING FOR INNOVATION 

 Tool applied : Storytelling 

 Challenge : 

 Storytelling tool are applicable in our day to day life . As a marketer of a   toothpaste company , I always faced the challenges of how to attract customers ,   how to make our new product more attractive . Besides , I also faced challenges of   how to ensure the phenomena of decreasing brand loyalty towards our products   being happened as there are variety of choices for customers to choose in the   markets nowadays . 

 Selection : 

 I choose to apply storytelling as it is able to get insight into users , build empathy .    One of the reason is , we can better understand what users want from a solution .    In a marketing company , if marketers use storytelling throughout the marketing   process to ensure that all work focuses on the users needs and the value that   company want to give those users . After completing marketing research to   understand your customer ’s needs , you use your research to tell a story about   who your customers are , what they want and how you will provide that . This   makes easier for everyone involved in the project to empathize with the   customers . 

 Application : 

 Storytelling involves emotional branding . Emotional branding is the practice of   building brands that directly appeals to customers emotional state , needs and   aspirations . Emotional branding helps to establish a connection between   customer and products . People want to meet demand and advertisers need to   implement these needs in a permanent cycle . Our company launched a campaign   where our customers can share their product experiences through videos and   blog . In a campaign , various food bloggers , artists and others share their   experiences with us . We provided links to purchase our products online with   different emotional videos that helps us to build a strong and loyal customer 

 base . This types of storytelling enables new customers more willingness to share   their experiences on our products . 

 Insight : 

 Through the learning process we got to improve our products features , designs to   meet customers expectations . We realized that people got attracted more by   normal customers review than the celebrities and artists . This helps us in making   our campaign more successful . 

 Approach : 

 Through applying the storytelling tools , another tools like visualization and mind- mapping directly applied . In order to perform better results , learning launch is   another tool that I would be considered in the next steps . We need as a team to   review the insights gained from our first two launches and incorporate the   insights into future launch products as this is the most effective way of   approaching solutions .

"Digital logic circuits are the basic building blocks of modern computers . To understand the   working of computers , one needs to know how numbers are represented and processed using   digital logic circuits . This course first teaches number representation in computers and Boolean   algebra . After covering minimization of expressions and basic logic gates , the design of   combinational and sequential circuits that perform a specific function are discussed . The aim of   the course is to provide the student with an understanding of how data is represented and   processed at the hardware level . This course acts as a foundation for a course on Computer   Architecture and Organization . 

 For example , computer A can communicate with computer C by using   TELNET . At the same time , computer A communicates with computer B by   using the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) . For these processes to receive data   simultaneously , we need a method to label the different processes .    In other words , they need addresses . In the TCP / IP architecture , the label   assigned to a process is called a port address . A port address in TCP / IP is 16   bits in length .

"Reflection Assignment – Mind mapping 

 Challenge 

 As part of an emerging event management start - up , each project provided us with a new learning   experience . As part of the first project , we were to organize friendship day event for children in a   reputed apartment space . With this project , we realised numerous mistakes we had committed during   the planning phase of the project . Our choice of colours , layout of the organized event , games selected   were not feasible as per the layout of the apartment , which in turn led to onsite change of plan and   ultimately ended up being an unpleasant experience for the guests . 

 Selection 

 Mind mapping method was opted to optimise our planning phase of our events . Considering that each   event is different and could involve numerous constraints , we wanted to develop categories and   prepare a standard checklist to ensure the client needs are well captured while optimizing our efforts   for organizing the event . 

 Application 

 A primary research was conducted to identify the basic needs for each category of events , such as ,   weddings , birthday celebrations , etc . , These inputs were then gathered and displayed on a board . The   idea was to identify any linkages and patterns in specific clusters of clients so we could achieve certain   degree of optimization on our efforts for certain events . The sticky notes gathered were grouped in   clusters such as , pink decoration were preferred for girls birthday celebrations , bachelorette parties   and baby showers . Hence , all these events were put into the cluster of pink decorations . This way we   could identify common linkages to the common resources that may be required . 

 Insight 

 One of the major advantage of using mind mapping was the optimum utilization of our resources   thereby cutting down cost drastically . The clusters also provided insights on common characteristics   shared with specific events that in turn helped us in providing standard set of options for certain   events and the customer could choose add - on services over and above the standard service . This way   we optimized man - hours required for a specific job by standardizing the cluster with common   characteristics and by having specialized human resources . 

 Approach 

 Having understood other design thinking tools , I look forward to apply learning launch for specific   corporate events that come from specific industries .

"Challenge & Selection : 

 I am responsible for driving pipeline across the sales cycle in the IT industry , from an operations   perspective . My work lies between 3 defined teams with different functions : pre - sales , sales and   marketing . Marketing creates the awareness and interest in the market , pre - sales ( a group of technical   experts & engineers ) provides thought leadership in the market and helps build the final offer to the   clients , and sales which creates trust with the customer and walks them through the buyer ’s journey . 

 After much analysis of pipeline reports , I discovered that the teams are not aligned on criteria and   processes for leads and their handoff between departments . This misalignment impacts our collective   KPIs and creates friction between the working groups . 

 I first approached this challenge by sending a questionnaire to the teams asking them to define a lead and   when they felt they should take ownership of it in the sales cycle in the hopes of finding common ground .   This proved to be problematic when the results showed the chasm between departments . I called a team   meeting to discuss the results of the questionnaire and the gaps I was seeing , but that devolved into an   argument and apathy to even identifying a problem . I needed to try something new , something that would   help the teams empathize with this misalignment but also start a different type of conversation . 

 I chose to apply the visualization tool with the teams , but I wanted it to be interactive , and in the form of   a physical exercise . 

 Application : 

 I facilitated a sales funnel exercise , using real people , for the teams to actually see the sales funnel in   person rather than on a screen / spreadsheet .   The assumptions / rules established for this exercise are as   follows : 

 -   We are in a fictional addressable market where our company is already positioned well as a brand 

 -   12 people will physically represent our prospects from the addressable market 

 -   Accepting that prospects will drop off and for the purposes of this exercise , the reasons would not be   explored 

 -   When prospects drop off , they will physically leave the room 

 -   We will achieve 2 qualified leads and 1 sale ( i.e.1 person remaining from the original group of 12 ) 

 The experiment : 

 12 people are brought into a room facing representatives from sales , pre - sales and marketing . As the   facilitator , I pose the question “ what are we going to do to make 1 of these individuals buy what we are   selling ” .   Members of the team are to propose actions , assign who executes and after each action is taken   the same question will be asked for the remaining prospects until we end with 1 .

 All can not agree on suggested actions , the type   of lead ( i.e. warm lead ) or if they should stay with   marketing or go to pre - sales and/or sales 

 conduct workshop or   assessment 

 Sales   ( proposed ) &   Presales   ( executed ) 

 Marketing agrees on suggested action . Presales   argues that it is wasted $ /effort w/o a high   probability for closing a deal . Team agrees the   people are hot leads , and that sales should own   the cycle from here 

 <NAME> are gathered   at workshop / assessment .   Offers are proposed . 

 Sales &   Presales   1 sale is made 

 Insights : 

 This exercise allowed all parties involved to experience the gaps I saw from the questionnaire . In the   beginning when there were more people in the room , everyone relied on the ideas from marketing , as if   they were not vested in the entire end to end process . As the numbers of prospects began to dwindle , the   sales and presales teams became more engaged in generating ideas ( i.e. not just relying on marketing but   rather opening up to different suggestions ) .   Conversely as the numbers dwindled , marketing became less   engaged in the process . 

 Using people , instead of data points in a CRM , led to the teams speaking differently . For example , the   conversation went from “ handing off a lead ” to “ what is the handshake point ” between our teams on   where we take this potential customer .    It also created a creative environment for all of us to ask questions   objectively , such as “ what do you consider a warm lead vs a hot lead ” and to agree on a criteria . 

 We did not finalize the process , but rather discovered that we need to explore processes further , which   was a surprise to all . We even uncovered a problem no one had considered- what happens to the 11   prospects that did not buy , and do we have a process in place to stop funnel leakage and pull them back   in the funnel ? At the end of the day three different teams came together and left as one team with a   mission to further explore processes and improvements , bringing us one step closer to the “ what is ” phase   in design thinking . 

 Approach : 

 I feel this approach worked because it moved the problems to a collective setting rather than an individual   departmental one that no one wanted to champion .   I originally thought of mind mapping the roles of   each department , but after the initial meeting , I realized that the teams needed to empathize with each   other and that mind mapping was only facilitating me to empathize with them . In the end the visualization   approach built a bridge between the teams that was necessary for us to identify problems and work on   the solutions together .

"DESIGN THINKING - VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGE AND <ADDRESS> 

 I work at the position of content manager and my basic goal is to lead my team   to get a final , good , needful content prepared . But to get content to the point ,   it ’s very necessary to understand the customer and his needs properly . For this   task I use visualization as a tool . I think visualization in the form of empathy   maps ,   experience   maps ,   etc . ,   can   be   a   game   changer   in   this 

 regard .   An empathy map is a collaborative visualization used to articulate   what we know about a particular type of user . It externalizes knowledge about   users in order to create a shared understanding of user needs , and aid in   decision making . 

 APPLICATION 

 First I divide my team of 8 members into groups of 2 and then ask them each   to give me an empathy map on the same customer . I often give them a time   frame . Also I instruct them to keep in mind the basic structure of the empathy   maps i.e. , the four quadrants ( Says , <NAME> , Does , and Feels ) of - course with the   customer in the middle . 

 The Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or   some other usability study . The Thinks quadrant captures what the user is   thinking throughout the experience . Ask yourself ( from the qualitative research   gathered ): what occupies the user ’s thoughts ? What matters to the user ? It is   possible to have the same content in both Says and Thinks . However , pay   special attention to what users think , but may not be willing to   vocalize . The Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes . From the   research , what does the user physically do ? How does the user go about doing   it ? The Feels quadrant is the user ’s emotional state , often represented as an   adjective plus a short sentence for context . Ask yourself : what worries the   user ? What does the user get excited about ? How does the user feel about the   experience ? 

 Each group is free to access the data required for the mapping by any means   they   can   arrange   for   example    user   interviews , field   studies , diary 

 studies , listening sessions , or qualitative surveys . As soon as the groups are   ready with their individual maps , I call up a discussion session . Then each   group presents their maps and their view of the customer and his needs . We   have an evaluation of each point discussed under each heads . After a complete   reviewing activity I give my inferences from all the maps and also give a revised   final empathy map to follow for the content creation to my team . 

 INSIGHT & APPROACH 

 The basic insight which I get from this activity is that the final empathy map 

 gives the team a better understanding of the customer and his needs which in 

 turn helps them to create a better and specific content for the customer .   What 

 user or persona will you map ? Will you map a persona or an individual user ? 

 Converge to cluster and synthesize : In this step , the team moves through the 

 stickies on the board collaboratively and clusters similar notes that belong to the 

 same quadrant . Name your clusters with themes that represent each group ( for 

 example , “ validation from others ” or “ research ” ) . Repeat themes in each 

 quadrant if necessary . The activity of clustering facilitates discussion and 

 alignment — the goal being to arrive at a shared understanding of your user by all 

 team members . Depending on the purpose of your empathy map , polish and 

 digitize the output accordingly . Be sure to include the user , any outstanding 

 questions , and the date and version number . 

 I found that visualization should be one of the starting steps for design thinking . 

 The other time I would also like to include the storytelling method along with the 

 visualization method so that my team can have a better understanding of the 

 requirements as well as they can also connect to the need in a much better way .

"Challenge :     I am working as an acting Team Lead in a HR Communications function . Some team   members felt they were n’t being fulfilled and external stakeholders wanted more value   added support . As part creating plans for the coming year we discussed as team the need   add further value to the organization and move towards a new vision of strategic   communications . That was the problem we started with : ‘ How might we improve   communications in the department ? ’ .      Selection :     As a precursor towards ideating new innovative ways to enhance communications in the   department , we had a team meeting inviting colleagues and different stakeholders to map   out the current services and experience we offer . We thought before exploring ideas we   need to know where we were . We would then fully map out ideas , and then review which   ones would be high priority . But in our approach we felt it important to be able to   understand the current lay of the land and the mind mapping exercise was going to play an   important role for us in that regard . To ensure I was well equipped to facilitate the session , I   reviewed ‘ the Mind Mapping tool ’ video from Week 3 .      Application :   We began the session outlining design challenge as noted under the challenge heading . Our   diverse stakeholders from within and without the team were invited to review current   communication assets produced by the team in recent months as well as interview notes   with department employees outlining experiences around communications as well as KPI ’s   around communications sent and survey data on quality of communications .      When the participants had reviewed the content we met together to initially map out what   the Communications team were producing in terms of communications . We asked   participants to make their own notes of mapping the as is scenario . Since we are working   remotely we used a skype whiteboard to take turns to place on a collective space , making   sure more senior members of the team went last supporting a safe space to share opinions .   I then facilitated a conversation with the team to cluster the groups of ideas listed .      We then took virtual stickers to each place on the clusters where we felt the greatest value   was provided and where we felt we needed to reduce transactional work . Through this   exercise we conducted mapping the ‘ As Is ’ scenario which then fed into a follow up mind   mapping session of what an ideal future could look like , with the same diverse participant   mapping what they would want to experience from a communications function .      Insight   Through the exercise I learnt about the power of collective wisdom and the richness of   perspectives that bringing together people from diverse outlooks and lenses bring . For   instance in this case we had people from our own team but also ‘ customers ’ – which made   us think about things from the perspective of the end user . From a personal perspective it   was so useful to switch up and challenge one ’s own assumptions . 

 The insights this experience brought to me was the importance of inclusivity and   accommodating different voices . The importance of creating an environment that   everyone ’s voice matters . Actually this process in itself gave various people more skin in the   game by shaping the outcome of the meeting . And finally it helped us really understand the   end user much more .     Approach     I would use this tool next time also . As it allowed for an creative and enjoyable way to map   current services from the perspective of the ‘ customer ’ . However going forward I would   incorporate more storytelling to enable us to empathize more with the human centred   needs of our end user . Furthermore I would like to have our team more of a back seat to   ensure we listen to the customer needs more rather than prescribe . Finally I would diversify   more voices of our customer also .

 Learning Launch 

 Challenge & Selection :     In my organization , my role is to partner with the business to ensure both internal ( employee ) and   external ( customer ) success . At the beginning of the year , our organization created a goal to improve   employee engagement and satisfaction by September 2021 . During the COVID-19 pandemic , we were   required to move our organization to 100 % remote work . In doing so , we were also required to review   our current policies , processes , and infrastructure to determine what changes were required to align   with a virtual world . Our challenge was to find a way to apply changes virtually and not only not impact   engagement and satisfaction , but also significantly improve it .     We had already gathered feedback from our employees at the end of the previous year , so we had a   good amount of information on what changes our employees were looking for . However , we needed to   find out of the solutions we came up with worked both in a virtual and in - office environment , and if   they would be successful .     As my department had already used various design - thinking activities and tools to determine the   solutions , the next step was to try the learning launch tool to quickly test the solutions .     Application :     We selected pilot groups for each department to both determine if the solutions would work and would   also work for every department . None of the pilot groups knew about the other pilot groups , and each   group signed confidentiality agreements for the pilot to ensure the ideas did n’t get polluted from other   areas .      Problems for employee engagement and satisfaction included gaps in manager training , employee   recognition , benefit options , and growth opportunities . Our ideas for solutions included implementing a   new recognition tool for both monetary and non - monetary recognition , implementing a newly - structured   manager training and workshop , implementing new benefit options including wellness reimbursements ,   volunteer programs , free virtual healthcare , and office equipment reimbursements , and creating new   career pathing and development plans .     In the first learning launch , we focused on manager training . We separated the managers for each pilot   group and provided them the new training . We separated the direct reports and also provided them an   assessment to complete based on their personality type , which would tell us how they would like to   communicate , be recognized , and be supported . We then provided a new tool to the managers that read   and interpreted the data about the employees and provided information on how to communicate ,   recognize , and support each employee individually . We then had the manager and direct reports resume   activities with this new information at hand for two months , and brought them back for a focus group .      In the second learning launch , we implemented the new recognition tool and the new career pathing   programs . We trained each pilot group on the new programs and then had them work with these tools for   six months , reviewing progress monthly . We also monitored usage and types of   recognition and career   pathing .     In the third learning launch , we implement the new benefit programs with the pilot groups only . We had   them use the benefits for the full duration and report back on any successes or failures . We also   monitored usage of these programs . 

 Insight & Approach :       Through the learning launches , we were able to identify aspects that worked , what did n’t work , and which   aspects were more valuable to certain departments . The pilot groups were able to fully test the new   solutions and provided valuable feedback to help us tweak aspects for full launch .     We anticipated all programs being successful and the results were a success – with the pilot group , the   employee engagement and satisfaction survey results increased by 30 % . When we launched it full - scale   company - wide after the small tweaks , our overall engagement and satisfaction improved by 20 % ( during a   year when most companies were going through layoffs and other hardships ) .     I think our approach was appropriate and effective as we had already used other design - thinking   processes to identify potential solutions .

 Design Thinking - A new perspective in Analytical Research and Development in Generic Industry 

 Challenge 

 Being an analytical research scientist in <NAME> industry , agility is the new normal to survive in the   current cut throat competition . The motto is First to market to cater to unmet needs of patients in the   world . 

 <NAME> product development contains making a bio - equivalent product of the innovator product   which is already existing in the market . The pharmaceutical companies has to identify the marketing   opportunities and develop new generic products . The faster the development , better are the returns . 

 The critical chain for the development of generic products is the analysis time and solvent   consumption . The analysis methods should be robust and be able to identify the variations which may   occur in different batches of the same product . The solvent consumption leads to heavy cost to the   company . There is chance of reducing the solvent consumption through shorter run time methods . 

 Selection 

 We focus on implementing the following to develop robust products by applying agile concepts 

 1 . Design Expert tool ( Quality by Design tool ) – This will help us in understand the robustness of   the analytical method . We can build the quality into the process leading to reproducible   methods at quality control .    2 . Multi - Dose dissolution apparatus – This equipment helps us to screen 8 different batches   simultaneously    3 . Fibre Optics in dissolutions – For online monitoring of dissolution results .   4 . Smart knowledge transfer – Usage of google glass technology for effective knowledge transfer   between R&D facility and manufacturing locations .    5 . Application of data management tools ( Information mapping ) – Mining of Vast data and   consolidating into information .   6 . Applying new separation techniques ( HPLC vs UPLC ) to reduce overall run time of analysis . 

 Application 

 The target of above techniques are 

 1 ) Reduced solvent consumption by reducing run time for analysis .    2 ) Simultaneously screening multiple batches .   3 ) Quality by design as a tool for monitoring the robustness of the product .   4 ) Instead of re - inventing the wheel , leveraging the vast data and mining quality information .    5 ) The R&D process has been recorded real - time by using google glass and sharing the same to   quality control to prevent the manual intervention . The process at quality control while   knowledge transfer can be monitored real - time by sitting at R&D.    6 ) As a pilot project , two products were selected for improvement by applying new tools . The   products were run in fibre optics dissolution apparatus and the results are matched with 

 conventional process . The run time in <ADDRESS> has been reduced by following new equipment of   UPLC where the run times are shorter further saving the solvent consumption for the analysis .    7 ) Now these techniques has been rolled out in all products . 

 Insight 

 By application of knowledge tools and new technology tools , we are able to successfully develop the   generic products in very short time . This has saved time and cost for the product development . The   friction between quality control and R&D department has also reduced a lot . 

 Approach 

 By application of the learning launch strategy of Design Thinking , we can have a strategic advantage   of resource optimization . The quality can be built into products instead of firefighting at the shop floor . 

 These methods helped us in removing common cause variation ( variation inbuilt in the process ) which   is very difficult to tackle .   Due to this , it has become easy to identify special cause variation ( Variation   due to external factor ) .

"Reflection - Learning Launch 

 1 . Challenge : I work in an educational institute . As part of the institute I deal with students , 

 teaching and non - teaching staff . There are a number of activities that require streamlining   and innovative way of implementing to get desired results . It could be activities like   improving bonding of alumni with the students , improving scores of students in certain   government exams , poor participation of faculty or students for certain activities , improve   relation between the teaching and non - teaching staff and so on .   One such challenge we   faced was when the Institute offered two courses which are mandatory for students of   Second year and Third year to attend 

 i.   Intended to improve creative thinking which stretches over 3 semesters 

 ii .   Intended to improve research skills which stretches over 1 semester 

 Both these courses are an initiative by the institute to improve student ’s skills . These   courses are not part of the university curriculum and hence the grades of these courses are   not mentioned in the university grade sheet . There are observations made of students   attending and submitting course work of courses that are part of university curriculum but   not for the above mentioned two courses . There is a growing trend of students not   attending the sessions conducted and disinterest in completing the course work . It was a   matter of concern because investments were made for conducting these courses in terms   of resource , time and money and the outcome expected for the courses were not observed   in the projects done by the student in the following year . So the challenge was how to   improve the participations of students in these courses . 

 2 . Selection : Based on the problem data was collected in terms of qualitative data as well as 

 quantitative data . The collected data gave rise to many assumptions about the cause of the   situation and there was a need to understand if these assumptions were the real the cause   of the problem . Since we have 20 batches with 20 students in each batch for each of the   semester we selected the learning launch tool to test the assumptions on each batch to   understand the real truth of the problem . Learning launch help to try and test the   assumptions made in short time . In the institute it very easy to implement the learning   launch tool to get through the core of the problem . It helped in understanding what the truth   behind the guesses made is , and go ahead with confirmed assumptions quickly . 

 3 . Application : So there were 40 batches in total and spread over session of 2hrs over a week 

 in 3 different space or classroom allocated for the same . Each batch was used to test two   of the hypothesis . Some of the assumptions tested was : 

 i.   If students were n’t aware of the time , these sessions would be conducted   with greater no . of students at any time . – Planned session which did n’t   reflect in the timetable were conducted which definitely improved the no . of   students but with disinterest . 

 ii .   Looks and feel of the room would bring a positive change – It brought no   change 

 iii .   Orientation of the program was conducted with detail discussion of the plan   as it was thought students were not made well aware about it . – No change   was observed . 

 iv .   Final year projects were allocated earlier to the students so that the students   felt a need to do the course for their project . – Quite a positive change was   observed in some patterns of combination of particular batch and teachers . 

 And many such assumptions were tested . 

 4 . Insight : These test that were conducted showed that it was not alone a result of student ’s 

 ownership that would bring improvement in participation for the course but also about the   faculty ownership . And better performance was observed from faculty and students when   the mentor of the batch was taking the session . Although the team members who were   working on this problem were from different domains there was one thing common and   that was all were teaching staff and this had led to a biased assumption that the main   problem was only the attitude of the students which was proved wrong by the Learning   Launch tool .   Mentoring , Project Allocation and These courses were always considered as   separate entities but this process of applying design thinking highlighted how different   process are interlinked . They had to be combined to improve the student skill especially   when the course is a non - graded one . The teaching staff other than the mentors showed a   reservation in giving input to projects other than theirs which was not the same in case of   the student mentor . Also the student required to thinking and give their opinions because   it required to be a very interactive sessions and they were at ease with their mentor . And   students were self - motivated to attend the course to get insight on how to best do their   projects for the final year . They felt they were solving their problems . 

 5 . Approach : I would like to use the <ADDRESS> mapping tool . It looks very promising of being 

 able to give good insights and to observe patterns and behaviour of the observation   collected . Also it would be a better way to present the observations to the management for   their easier understanding .

"Reflection- <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 I was a part of the escalation teams for one of the leading bank , we often used to get escalation from   customer about the payments being overcharged , we charging them early repayment charge   incorrectly , their rate not been switched as per request . With current pandemic scenario it become   imperative for us to review this and get back to the customer within a couple of hours since it was   already difficult for them to manage the finances . The Turnaround Time was very stringent , and the   number of escalations was high which resulted in extended Turnaround time which also resulted in poor   customer experience and in decline in <ADDRESS> . The escalation team was disheartened since they were   unable to go back to the customer within the agreed timeline . 

 Selection 

 We have selected mind mapping tool for this process to understand in detail in terms of where the gap   is and what is causing for us to delay the timelines . We tried to understand the escalation team   perspective and also looked at this from a customer lens . We mapped the entire journey of the   escalation process using mind mapping technique as how it arrives where it is moved , where is the   dependency , how many branches it moved further and with all those challenges what will be the ideal   Turn around time we can promise the customer . Mind mapping tool also will help us to understand   visually which cross function is taking a lot of time to resolve the problem 

 Application 

 We applied mind mapping tool and mapped the entire “ What If ” journey of a customer , we looked at all   possible ways , spoke to all departments who are involved in resolving the escalation , This gave us a   broader view of current reality of the process and the gaps . This visual , creative tool helped us not to   understand the current reality but also to draw a picture of “ What If ” process . We also understood why   these escalations are even coming in the first place . Mind mapping tool helped us to realize the core   underlying issues when we started mapping it to multiple branches . 

 Insights & Approach 

 The creative , visual tool really helped us to understand a lot of gaps , and what an end customer would   need to go through do to all these gaps . It also helped us to see different criteria like People issue ,   Process Issue , Policy issue , System issues , the number of handoffs internally which delayed the   escalation process , the number of misses from people which caused the escalation in first place , the   legacy process which was designed that way and the system issue where some rate changes are not   reflecting and the correct payments reflecting within the system . Mind mapping really helped us to   understand the current reality and how severe is the gap and the impact and severe to the end   customer . 

 Post identifying all these gaps we looked at “ What WOWs ” and What Works ” and we went back to   Technology team and fixed the system issue , we redefined the process and shared the revised   procedure with people , we created videos to educate our people working in the team , we also cross   trained people to ensure minimal or no handoff to ensure the escalation turnover time is as per the 

 agreed one with customers .   We also created visual presentation of current process and shared with the   team every fortnightly to ensure minimal or Zero quality errors . We closely tracked the customer   complaints and NPS post implementing these changes to see if we need to look an enhancing our   current ‘ What is ” method .

"Men ’s Fashion Brand : A rebranding strategy   using the Storytelling Tool 

 Challenge 

 As a marketing manager in a medium size and established fashion company I came 

 up with a great challenge to develop the brand 's rebranding approach and 

 repositioning strategy in the market and in the perceptions of customers ’ community . 

 The company has a strong market presence dating back to over half a century 

 ( established in 1960 ) and it operates with 35 retail shops all over the country of <ADDRESS> . 

 The company creates male fashion and its brand represents the synonymous to 

 contemporary way of life , bearing in mind the best possible quality / price relation . Its 

 signature products being its shirts and polo shirts . The brand is broadly distinguished by 

 its elegant , minimalist and comfortable lines , ideally balancing between the mystique 

 of modern - day life and the timelessness of the classic , bringing out the uniqueness in 

 every man . In addition , the company follows a traditional family business case 

 constituting as well as an important sign both for the market competition and for the 

 brand itself . The project aimed to reveal the perceptions of younger potential 

 customers about men ’s fashion brand , brand ’s reputation and placement , as well as 

 their needs regarding their clothing habits . Moreover , aimed also to suggest new 

 marketing strategies to attract younger customers . 

 Selection 

 To better understand the history of brand , its clothing personalization and their brand ’s 

 fans I select to use the storytelling tool . As commonly understand , clothing is a part of 

 our psychology and it depends on our routine , needs , way of living and personality . I 

 wanted to learn stories about the people who wear this brand and how they feel . These 

 stories can make clearer the connections between customers and brand . This 

 information gathered can help to develop a specific strategy answering if the brand 

 can create effective associations with younger people , which are the connections 

 between brand and fans and what has to be done for the future . Storytelling tool help 

 me to get a deeper access on customers experiences , to discover brand ’s equity as 

 every brand has a “ story and this story connects to the emotions , the characters , the 

 values of the people , that live that product every day ” ( Video “ Storytelling tool ” ) . 

 Application 

 I first divided two groups of circle discussions in which participants know the brand and 

 do n’t . Then , these groups were divided in other two groups of young ( 25 - 34 years old ) 

 and older men ( 35 - 45 years old ) from different places of the country . In these 

 discussions storytelling tool help me explore their journey selection on men ’s fashion 

 brand , their preferences on products , under what circumstances they choose a brand , 

 how brand influence their choice , how the price affects their decision , what are their 

 feelings created from different brands , what they feel and what they consider to 

 represent our brand . For those who did n’t know the brand the processes was to discuss 

 what they think that our brand represents . Each discussion was conducted within a 

 thirty minute timeframe . Storytelling was the key tool to understand what our audience 

 wants providing us useful data for clear strategies . 

 Insight 

 By applying the storytelling tool , I sat down with each participant sharing stories and 

 examples from our everyday ’s living . Initially , I started the conversation by sharing my 

 thoughts about how choosing colors , product types , and brands influence my 

 appearance . I talked about how I feel and what people around me are thinking about 

 me . I gave examples with specific products and opinions of my friends . This helped 

 them become familiar with the discussion and formulate their own thoughts . A set of 

 questions helped us draw more data . The actual results from participants ’ stories were 

 different from what we anticipated . Management unit was believing that the brand 

 can easily find the approach of entering into the younger audiences but discussing 

 with people who knew the brand we resulted in different thoughts . Most of our 

 participants talked about stories that our brand remains attached to a fairly business 

 style , political and mature level of appearance . They described that brand ’s product 

 lines , formal style and innovation in some types are directly related to their professional 

 status . Unlike with the young people we discussed that brand is linked to social 

 acceptance and impression . Using examples from everyday life , sharing stories of 

 specific occasions and utilizing photographic material we came to the conclusion that 

 the margin of entry in the young segment is very limited . 

 Approach 

 The use of storytelling tool helped me to learn more about the exact information we 

 need to share with our customers . Talking with potential customers and competitors 

 can help you understand the key message we need broadly to disseminate and 

 preserve as a company . So , we learnt that we have to create this story , the real one 

 which comes from brand ’s fans , in a really good context connecting emotions , needs , 

 images and moments of reflection . For future approach we could try to use after the 

 storytelling tool the visualization approach in order to map our customers ’ journey 

 developing effective touch points between us .

"Reflection :   Learning Launch Tool 

 Challenge   I am a product manager for a healthcare technology company , and I manage a service used by   health insurance companies to verify credentials of healthcare providers they contract with .   It   consists of back - office business process operations underpinned by a software application .   A   customer interested in purchasing our service wanted a significant amount of customization   before they would sign a contract , but we faced a twofold challenge : 

 1 .   The customization they were asking for was complex , involved significant changes to 

 both the software as well as multiple back - office processes and there was a high risk that   we would spend a lot of money developing what they thought they needed , but that   even if we built exactly what they said , that it would not meet their needs .   After all , what   people say they want is often different from what they actually want . 

 2 . Our business model made several assumptions about how efficiently our analysts would 

 be able to do the custom work they needed , and there was a risk that our pricing would   not cover our costs if those assumptions turned out to be incorrect . 

 Selection   The Learning Launch tool seemed like the perfect tool to address our challenge .   Because we   were doing exactly what Ed <NAME> describes in the Learning Launch Tool video of week 4 :   we   were creating our financial projections based on a number of assumptions , and we were also   assuming that the customer knew what they wanted and that we understood their description of   it .   Using the Learning Launch Tool , we could address the customer - need uncertainty as well as   mitigate some of the cost risk we were assuming , testing our assumptions of what the customer   wanted as well as our assumptions of how efficiently we could deliver this to them .     Application   We proposed to our customer that we would create a series of service concept prototypes that   we would ask them to interact with so they could experience how the service would work rather   than just hear or read our description of it - after explaining the rationale , they completely   bought into the idea !   Because the credentials verification process can take several days , our first experiment was an   accelerated simulation of the various touchpoints different users of the customer organization   would have with the service .   Rather than making all changes to our software ( which would have   been expensive ) , we had a UX designer create just the front - end screens that users would   interact with .   Behind the scenes , we had people doing the various things that in real life the   software would eventually do - but in the short term it was a lot faster to get people to do it , and   far less expensive to make changes if we learned that it needed to look or behave differently   than we originally anticipated .   We had users place orders , view reports that would show them   the status of their orders , and finally delivered to them ( manually generated ) credentials files   and asked them to conduct a mock credentialing committee meeting using the files we 'd   delivered to them . 

 Our second experiment was to validate many of our cost assumptions .   We randomly selected a   group of our analysts , trained them on the revised process and had them perform the   verification work on a number of "" dummy "" credentials files .   By timing them as they went   through the process , we were able to arm ourselves with real data that we could then feed into   our financial cost projections .     Insight   The simulation with the customer was hugely successful !   The experience of actually interacting   with the simulated service allowed them to make several suggestions for improvements to the   interface .   It also gave them a much higher level of confidence that we understood what they   needed .   Most importantly , it led to the discovery that one of the functions they had originally   wanted us to perform required data that was proprietary .   They made the decision at that early   stage to keep the function in - house , whereas it would have cost both parties considerably more   if we had that learning experience later in the process once we 'd already started developing the   customization .   The second experiment did not unearth any such surprises .   It was nonetheless valuable ,   because by validating our original assumptions it gave our senior leadership greater confidence   in our financial projections and lowered the risk on the project .     Approach   I found the Learning Launch tool to be an extremely effective way to de - risk the two problems of   customer needs uncertainty and operational execution uncertainty .   In future , I would deploy   the Learning Launch tool slightly differently – in hindsight , it felt like our experiments were   slightly large and we were attempting to validate multiple assumptions .   I would conduct smaller ,   more focused experiments designed to validate a single assumption or fewer assumptions ,   making the management of the experiments easier and gaining the option to pivot sooner if my   learning points me in a different direction than originally envisioned .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I took this course because I am developing an idea , and I was struggling with how to manage a non- profit venture in an emerging - market country ; however , this tool -Learning Launch- has delighted me .   My problem was that I was thinking in big ; I wanted to solve a country problem without knowing   whether or now my solution is suitable . On top of that , another big issue is this new environment and   game rules - this is an unprecedented time , and I have no idea how to run a venture from scratch . 

 Selection 

 As I need a tool that allows me to try , learn , and build on this learning , I think this Learning Launch tool   is great for solving the problem I am facing . I would start small , design a prototype , and go to the market   ( a very small and specific market ) , observe , interview with some customers , get feedback , and build   again . It is a virtuous cycle that would be helpful for my venture . In my understanding is to make these   testings as cheap and as fast as possible . 

 Application 

 This COVID-19 crisis has created a lot of chaos , but at the same time , some opportunities . Many   countries have strict restrictions ; however , this situation is a great chance to control your market and to   be close to your customers . I believe that in the middle of this crisis , my idea , which is related to health   services , could take its first steps . 

 While I am watching the videos , I was thinking about my stakeholders . Who do I need to reach out ?   Who do I already know ? What partnerships can I build ? Nevertheless , I think partnerships are really   important to launch a venture , but I ca n’t wait for them . At these times , many potential partners are   more conservative than bold . 

 For this reason , I am planning to design a good - enough prototype and go to the market ( a specific   niche ) , and offer my service . Observe what is going on with the customer interactions , and try to   understand what is valuable for them and how I can reach it . 

 I would try to apply a zero - resources - to - market approach . I would bootstrap my efforts to test my idea .   After some testings , I would know whether I am in the right way , or I should pivot to another strategy or   approach . I am working on this venture on my own so that this tool would help me to save resources ,   and learn about what creates value for my customer . 

 Insight 

 There is no real insight yet . I will apply this tool in the following weeks ; however , my personal insight is   that I should experiment and test my key assumptions ( my value proposition ) to know whether I should   stay with my idea or not . It is the best way to learn and be efficient . Furthermore , ideas are plentiful ;   what really matters is taking action .

"Reflection : Learning Launch Tool 

 Selection and Challenge 

 The tool I have selected , and which I will detail in this reflection , is the Learning Launch Tool . The use of trials and experiments within quick succession and with minimal cost was an effective means of   testing my hypothesis : that a market existed for the resale of particular brands of shoes and clothing in   second - hand markets . As stated by <NAME> <NAME> in the Week 4 lectures , one of the purposes of the Learning   Launch is to form a hypothesis and to test the key assumptions fast . Given that I had at least a few   major assumptions in my hypothesis , that were grounded in little experience , the use of this tool was   the perfect opportunity to test them in reality . The selection of this tool was also useful in the sense that   it allowed me to focus on the identification of the needs of my potential customers and how I could   meet them ; these are also key tenets of engaging in a learning launch according to <NAME> <NAME> . 

 The challenge(s ) faced   were in the initial stages of launching an online second - hand business , as a   personal side venture . Testing the needs and desires of a particular area of the market in my country   was imperative within a short space of time and on a limited budget . Such constraints made the   challenge ideally suited to the use of the Learning Launch tool , as <NAME> <NAME> explains these are both   feasible and necessary in the use of Learning Launches .   The business involves selling second - hand   shoes and clothing as a registered small business . Sourcing the appropriate inventory , whilst important ,   was not as crucial as obtaining the data on what the customers were willing to pay for which brands   and which styles . It was necessary that this data was obtained with limited resources ( time and   finances ) given my desire to not over invest in a non - viable business .   However , ultimately the   Learning Launch Tool should be used as a test of the truth , as explained by <NAME> <NAME> . These truths   would then inform my purchasing , marketing and pricing decisions for the next stage of the business .   Some of the initial assumptions that I had made were to be soon disproved whilst others remained   intact . 

 Application 

 Upon conducting my original research on areas of the US market for second - hand clothing and shoes , I   was then able to form my own hypothesis for a small business in resale . I supposed that given my   familiarity with certain brands and wholesalers of goods I would be able to establish a small - scale   business selling these brands for profit . Moreover , these brands proved to be popular with US online   resellers . My key assumptions at this stage were that there were a dozen brands I was very familiar   with that would have a space in the market in my home country . I also assumed that I would be able to   make sales over four particular styles of shoes ( sports , casual , sandals , and formal dress ) . As explained   in the Week 4 lecture by <NAME> <NAME> , these assumptions , and the hypothesis ,   should then be tested against   the learning launch process . 

 I went out and sourced inventory that covered a wide - base of brands , styles , and sizes . Purposefully   keeping the focus broader at this stage was essential to an effective application of the learning launch , 

 in my opinion , as it would then enable me to hone in on the areas that were working well and focus on   these . <NAME> <NAME> reiterated the need for lots of tests at this stage , and I made certain to apply this .   In my   application of this tool I was seeking “ the customer need that is so burning ... ” ( <NAME> <NAME> , 2016 ) and to   identify who these customers were through attempting to obtain quality data and a reasonable quantity   also . <NAME> explains the idea of seeking both the confirming and dis - confirming facts in the Learning   Launch process . The search for facts was directed and greatly assisted by my access to various data sets and metrics that could track what products were obtaining interest and what factors were leading to this degree of interest . In a matter of days I was able to test my assumptions in the marketplace and use this   data to pivot the direction of the business from there on . Toward the end of my trials I had refined my   list to 5 - 6 key brands that proved to be potential sellers in the shoes and clothing category , and to   identify an optimum price range for these . With regard to the shoes , I was only able to obtain sufficient   interest in 2 - 3 major brands , and across only two different styles . 

 Unfortunately , there were areas in which I was unable to apply this tool effectively or indeed at all . My   application of sourcing customer needs was measured in a fashion that was too quantitative , I believe . I was unable to engage in any meaningful conversations with my limited customers in these trials , and   this may prove detrimental to my assumptions going forward . Furthermore , <NAME> explains the   importance of seeking dis confirming facts and the value of seeking input from a skeptic and diverse   team . I did not actively seek the views of a skeptic , instead relying on my objective viewing of the   numbers and data to confirm and dis confirm my assumptions . Still , confirmation bias could easily   have influenced my decisions at this point . 

 Insight 

 The insight I have obtained   has profoundly shifted my thinking on the initial challenge , to a point that I have had to considerably re - frame the challenge itself . My attempts in using the Learning Launch tool   revealed that many of my key assumptions simply were not true for the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> marketplace . This was quite demoralizing in that it became quite apparent that brands and styles that might be high   demand overseas were virtually unwanted here . However , as explained by <NAME> <NAME> , the application of   the Learning Launch will never be a failure if you learn something ; Indeed , I was able to learn many a   valuable lesson . I feel I have a greater appreciation for the role of qualitative data from customers going forward , as my data sets were perhaps too quantitative in their nature- I was n't actually engaging in   those crucial early conversations that would have been pivotal to selecting the right brands and styles .   This has allowed me to better appreciate the value of considering multiple design tools in the Design   Thinking process . Whilst the nature of this assessment was to focus on a single tool , I can see how in   isolation their worth is perhaps not as effective if say I had used a tool that better utilized ethnographic   methods . I 've also gained an insight into the tools as just a single part of the Design Thinking process .   Perhaps if I had engaged in greater depth in the “ what is ? ” and “ what if ? ” stage of the process my   approach in the initial assumptions and hypothesis would have been closer to reality . 

 The value of fast and inexpensive cycles of testing is something I have also grown to appreciate   through this process . This is central to the Design Thinking process , as explained in the Week 1 video   lectures that explain the process as “ learning in action ” . Through small and fast experiments I was able   to enter the marketplace and test my key assumption without over - investing . It was a process of solving the initial problems I had in entering the resale business . However , in reality , the process proved to be   far more complex/ wicked than initially anticipated as other variables that were not initially considered 

 factored into the equation . I believe this reiterates that my focus on a single tool is not a summation of   the entire Design Thinking process , and Design Thinking is only one type of thinking- a point also   reiterated by Professor Liedtkain in the Week 1 video lectures . 

 Approach : 

 Whilst the reflection thus far has focused on what I have done effectively and ineffectively in the use of the Learning Launch Tool in this challenge , I have a few key aspects I would change next time around .   The overarching focus , in future attempts , would be to authentically integrate the use of the Learning   Launch tool , and other tools , into the Design Thinking process . The approach I have taken was too   isolated from Design Thinking as an entire process . I would also integrate ethnographic research into   my challenge very early on . I feel that my understanding of the customers thought process and needs is   still very vague . The insights I could have obtained from <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> consumers and potential   customers would have better informed my purchasing decisions and also affected my sourcing options   early in the first weeks of business . My customer empathy probably is n't authentic after the limited   qualitative information I was able to obtain . Identifying the unarticulated needs of my customers would have been better obtained through a journal tool , or another projective technique . If I had focused some of my finances on some initial customer research in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> market , perhaps I would have a   stronger understanding of my customers at this point in my business venture . 

 Having a set of solid design criteria that informed my purchasing and marketing decisions would also   have been useful prior to using the Learning Launch , I believe . I think my lack of effective research of   the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> market really highlights the weakness of my work in the “ what is ? ” and “ what if   stage ? ” . Again , this comes back to the need to view the Design Thinking process as a holistic approach , and not one to be conducted through an isolation of its components .

"Visualization tool 

 Challenge     I worked for one of the top 100 companies in the world . Although he has left the   company now , there were so many things he felt sorry about while working at   the company . Once it was a big problem in changing the organizational structure .   The team I belonged to repeated staff changes every time . Regarding this issue ,   the company 's management department and human resources team thought it   was a matter of millennial generation . But do you really ?   What our organization needed was a major reorganization review . I thought   visualization and design thinking were necessary to solve these    problems .       Choice     I decided to use a visualization tool . The reason for using this tool is that the   data I had to submit to the committee was very complicated . I also wanted to   introduce the concept of Agile@scale into the new organizational structure . The   traditional way of expression of Excel and PPT would not have delivered the   message I wanted to convey . I could n't think of a better tool than a visualization   tool . Also , I decided to gather the opinions of the members of the organization   through storytelling methods . For example , how markets have changed since the   last time we created an official organizational structure , and how many   parameters have become obsolete while new challenges creep in .     Approach : 

 This helped me push forward a customer - centered approach to organizing the   structure .     Applications : 

 Figure 1 : With the help of the People Analytics team , I have created a vector   version of the current organizational structure , which includes each department   and the number of employees . A set of skills for all functions has been shown on   the map .     Figure 2 : With HR details , staff details and the necessary product portfolio , we   presented a new business ecosystem to enter . 

 One of the main insights I 've gained is that many of us look outside for the cause   of the problem while designing the solution . On the other hand , the same weight   should be given to internal customers .

"Reflection - visualisation Unlocking community facilities 

 Challenge I work for a local government ( council ) in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . Management and   elected members   were concerned that council managed community facilities were difficult to access by community   organisations and members of the public . My team is not responsible for the management / booking   of any facilities , however , is responsible for planning for the demand for additional facilities . The   scoping stage of the challenge indicated that : • Council hired 56 facilities • Facilities were managed by 5 different departments ( 8 different work units ) • There were 32 different customer categories • More than 140 different fee options • Seven different booking systems • Eight different booking forms and hire agreements 

 The project scope was to : • Improve the experience for the customer , while not centralising the management internally • Optimise community access and use of council managed community facilities 

 The project was considered a wicked problem to solve because :   • The problem was human - centered - we had no information about how intricacies of the 

 management system , nor customer experiences / expectations 

 • There were too many moving parts to clearly understand / document the problem as such we 

 relied on gut - feeling 

 • There was a large amount of uncertainty around what the current practices were • Whilst there was a corporate booking system , the data was unusable for analysis 

 Due to lack of data , storytelling was a powerful tool to keep the project ’s momentum and to trial a   number of ideas . 

 Selection One of the biggest challenges was for the different officers in charge of bookings to accept current   practices were inefficient and bad customer service . As it was impossible to apply process or   analytical thinking to this problem , storytelling was a powerful tool to get consensus and buy - in to   the project . It was essential the catalyst for a series of little changes to current practices that had   long term positive benefits to the organisation and community groups . 

 Application There were many stories told to help describe the current situation . For example : • The story of a bogus example of what it is like to deal with council when contact is made to book 

 facilities , the trials , the tribulations and the frustrations from a customer ’s perspective . The story   started by describing the customer , a non - English speaking older lady with no interest . 

 • The story about how council potentially can ask the same community volunteer for the same 

 piece of paper 17 times every year . 

 These stories helped set the scene . From there ideas were generate from a number of unlikely   officers to improve the situation . My name is <NAME> and throughout the process I used the ‘ <NAME> ’s   Dancing Dogs ’ as a bogus storytelling narrator . So much so , that stakeholders were using ‘ <NAME> ’s   Dancing Dogs ’ when talking about ideas in later stages of the project . 

 Insight and approach <NAME> was used a lot . Some stories were real life examples modified to protect the identity of   customers , others were fictitious to either provide insight to current practices or to test / talk through   ideas . 

 Storytellng , in its many forms used of the last couple of months , have been pivotal in helping people   stay focused , to share experiences , and most importantly emphasise with council ’s customers -   especially in an environment where there were considered a nuisance and difficult to deal with . 

 In two months , officers have implemented a number of changes , most have been successful - some   were not successful but ones that we still learnt lesson from .

The team setup meetings with project 's key stakeholders , and   through the course of 3 days , the team was able to put together a mind map problem   scenario , and proposing alternative solutions . Through the course of the meetings , the   following questions were answered , and incorporated into the mind map : 

 ● What is the potential set of customers who will be happy with this app and 

 why ? This question captured information that pertained to the app 's   stakeholders , their values , their current problems , context and their expectations . 

 ● Who will use the app ? This question captured the appropriate audience for the 

 app that will be developed . 

 ● When do they use the app ? This captured the app 's story .   ● What other systems have a necessity to communicate with the app being 

 developed ? This question captured other systems outside the app that have a   necessity to work with the app being developed . 

 ● What information do you want to manage in the app ? This question captured 

 usability and security requirements . 

 ● Backlog : This acted as a placeholder for items the team could not find answers 

 to during the session , and the schedule for development of the next user stories . 

 4 . Insight : At the end of 3 days , the team and key stakeholders , were able to agree on 

 overview and process relationships the mind map revealed . It especially helped with   revealing system dependencies thee team had n’t thought about . This in turn , helped   prioritize the backlog , and development task schedules . The most revealing outcome   from the mind mapping sessions , was the shared insight the team developed , and   applied in forming the final mind map . 

 5 . Approach : With everything the team learnt from the meetings with stakeholders , and 

 putting together the mind map , next time the team uses a mind map on a product   development project , the team will have product stakeholders also put together mind 

 maps , based on their interpretation of the problem scenario , and propose alternative   solutions . This will help in reducing the time spent interpreting meeting notes , and   providing stakeholders and product development team with the same shared insight .

"Learning Launch - Improvement in 

 bottling lines 

 Challenge : 

 Today I work in the area of beverage packaging , which has long been developing 

 technologically and has a very specific and protocolized problem solution support that 

 normally requires a very specialized workforce in this sector in the industry . 

 Two years ago , we started having a lot of problems related to transportation of bottles . 

 The glass bottles were heavily impacted during shipping and this led to a high index of 

 glass breaking and down time . All our indicators of loss and performance were being 

 impacted by this . 

 <NAME> <NAME> : 

 In the market , the existing solution requires a labor force specialized in automation to 

 adjust speed and modulation of transport . Every start of the year , we faced the same 

 question : how to increase efficiency , knowing that we can not afford the automation 

 service ? 

 We needed to develop solutions that were really engaged with consumer 

 expectations , testing those solutions in practice . 

 That ’s why we chose the “ Learning Launch ” tool . 

 Application : 

 In these same situations , while trying to explain high investments ( in which top 

 management believed but did not want to invest ) we had a group of operators that 

 had other cheaper solutions but in which the company saw no potential . 

 To finally prove the investment , we made the prototypes of how the production would 

 be with both solutions . 

 We tested the two solutions in small tests , planned in the smallest possible time levels : 

 In the end , we came to the conclusion that the homemade solution , in addition to 

 being cheaper , was most suitable for the expected levels of efficiency and bottle 

 breakage . 

 Insight : 

 Without learning launch methodology , we would continue with the old automation 

 solutions . Arriving at lower solutions than we arrived , with greater investments . 

 Approach : 

 In the next situations where we are faced with this type of problem , we will certainly 

 concentrate on listening to people at the end of the chain and doing more 

 experiments , instead of following patterns of solutions that we simply believe , without 

 experimentation , be the best .

"Example Reflection – Ethnographic Research 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In my work , I mostly cooperate with students . In our program at the University , we try to build   bridge between the business partners and the academia represented by students . Once we   identify real business needs , interests or problems that are truly unclear and require deeper   understanding , we build teams of students in collaboration with the company representative to   address these challenges . The teams consist of 4 - 6 students with different scientific and cultural   background . They are mostly international students and one member of the team is from the   company itself . We , me and my colleagues , facilitate the groupwork throughout an eight - week   process . As a new colleague , I do not yet have any experience I could use as an example . So I   decided to present a planned use of a tool that I consider as the most appropriate for the main   question of our starting project . 

 So , I present now a certain , partially fictitious case , that I think would require ethnographic   research tools in the ‘ what is ’ phase of the problem - solving process . There is a food company ,   that makes dairy products and is facing a phenomenon of the emerging demand for vegan   products replacing milk . They have noticed this trend in foreign markets , but they do not see   the main drivers , consumer preferences and how this tendency will influence the local market   situation . They want to see better their future opportunities to timely prepare for innovations . 

 Application 

 I focus on the “ What is ? ” phase in my reflection . I will sketch a design research plan based   mostly on ethnographic tools using projective techniques as well , because this case typically   needs the better understanding of consumer ’s attitudes , motivations and unarticulated needs ,   just as in the MeYouHealth case . So , the project question is how widespread the phenomenon   is , what are the reasons for this trend getting even stronger , and what opportunities the company   has to develop its business further ? 

 The potential customers , people who consume either dairy products or a vegan substitute , are   very diverse , if possible , even more so than in the MeYouHealth story . However , the problem   and possible answers do not seem as complex as in that case . 

 The task is to explore the motivations that directs the choices towards vegan substitutes instead   of milk and other animal - based dairy products . Discover what the problems are , the possible   bad feelings for milk that are causing this tendency of altering preferences . Besides the so   obvious problems such as allergies or other food sensitivity issues , look for hidden motivations   trough in - depth personal interviews using projective elements . In addition to primary research   focus I plan to look at online forums , blogs , customer feedbacks on competitor ’s websites ,   observe the product location in various stores , where milk and substitute products are located   relative to each other , what are the packaging characteristics , etc . 

 And finally find correlations , patterns emerging from the gained insights by grouping them   through mind mapping , and trying to turn them into design criteria and future business   opportunities . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 I am very curious about the insights . Do ethnic , cultural issues matter , or do fashion trends , or   other obvious explanatory factors such as allergies , or sensitivities dominate ? How many strong   persona , character will emerge ? And one can go on with the questions . 

 I find the wide range of Design Thinking activities very exciting . It is also a real challenge to   find the most appropriate tools for a certain problem , and I think the course was very useful to   highlight the opportunities of different cases , tools , series of activities . Thanks .

"Reflection – storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I have been supporting non - governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , especially those of a smaller size , as   volunteer , their main problem is that they do not have the adequate means to make their cause visible   and keep them in people 's minds due to the high costs that this represents , making it difficult to obtain   donations in order to carry out their work . Consequently , many people who are not an active part of the   social support environment are unaware of the causes and projects of the foundations , thus limiting the   possibility of raising awareness in the population . 

 The main tool that an NGO has is the ability to tell stories , they serve to empower people , who know   that they have the possibility of improving their lives , getting them to know stories of other people who   have been in the same situation and have managed to get out ahead . 

 NGOs should know how to get their message to others to get support for their social projects . Through   the life stories behind each cause . We are looking that the donor feels empathy or affinity to finally   achieving support . 

 Usually we have to meet with large companies to ask for donations , these companies tend to make the   process long and tedious , and often do not end up delivering the funds . Because of this , I decided to   create a new approach to the way collection is done . The idea is to present a “ business plan ” where a   business becomes the central axis of fundraising . Thus , we want the store to donate a percentage of the   sales for each client that we take to the store . 

 Application 

 The biggest challenge is to inspire the owners of these businesses to see this philosophy as an   advantage , that they can realize that helping foundations does not represent an expense for them , but   an opportunity for improvement , attracting consumers who are aligned with social support , thereby   achieving loyalty . 

 I met with the owner of an Italian food trade and told him about this new “ business model ” . For this I   started talking about my experience working with NGOs and the people we help , at the same time the   owner told me that in the past , a cousin of him had cancer , and thanks to the family support and   financial support of his medical insurance he could recover from his illness . I took this information that   he gave me and told him how extraordinary it would be that thanks to his store people who do not have   financial resources and are going through the same situation that happened to his cousin , could receive   treatments and save their lives , I let him realize that his store , Instead of being a simple business that   makes a profit , could become an change ’s agent and generates well - being for society . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This new approach was really a 180 - degree turn , with the NGOs we were working on the story - telling   style to raise funds , but we did n't really involve the future donor in the story , we talked more as if we   were selling a product . In this case , when turning the owner of the store into the hero of the story , I   completely caught his attention , he likes the innovative idea and he also felt that he could be useful to   society thanks to this we were able to schedule new meetings to refine the idea . 

 What I liked most about this tool is that through it , the owner of the company was involved , in the   whole story , making the merchant to stop being a spectator and making him the main character that   would help to achieve the change that these NGOs want to make .

"MIND MAPPING 

 CHALLENGE 

 During my last year of high school , I was asked to give several classes about political   geography to my first - year classmates , because I had the best grades in that subject , and   the group I was going to teach had low performance . The first class was a failed attempt   because I made use of slides with a lot of information and some images , but only a few   students understood , the rest did n't understand and did n't keep their attention on the subject . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 I decided to implement another tool in my class , the mind map because in addition to being   very creative , it is more visually appealing , intuitive , and attractive . It 's a representation of   the topic , but in a more didactic way , it 's based on patterns and ideas , and gives them an   order of understanding , thus improving the comprehension of the topic . 

 APPLICATION 

 In the first 10 minutes of the second class , I used the information slides and as in the   previous occasion , the students lost interest . At that moment I stopped and presented them   a mental map of the topic , they seemed surprised by the sudden change so they paid a lot   of attention to the map and I could see the understanding in their eyes . I explained my map   and I did n't stop there when I finished explaining I left them an activity , which consisted of   working in small groups and making a mental map of their own . So that they would n't only   listen to me , but also stimulate their understanding and creativity by making a map with the   same information , but with their own design .   When they finished , I was able to review their   work and I had no doubt , they had understood effectively . 

 In the following classes , I taught in the same way , with mind maps , to which the group   seemed to respond effectively . At the end of my lessons , a test was given and everyone had   passing grades . 

 INSIGHT 

 I was able to understand that the use of didactic tools enhances the perception of a topic ,   both the creation and interpretation of mind maps facilitate understanding . I was able to meet   the challenge effectively because of this tool .   It was n't just that my students understood   better , but that I was able to better convey what I wanted to teach them . 

 APPROACH 

 For my challenge I could n't have used visualization or storytelling , because what I wanted   to transmit were facts , theoretical knowledge , for this reason , it was n't viable to launch   learning , it was n't really possible to experiment . Of course , if it had been science classes ,   the best thing would have been the launch learning , even mixing it with maps . The best tool   I used and would use again is mind maps because of their dynamism , ease of use , and   visual stimulation .

 The above mentioned elements are covered in the following description for : 

 To design and develop autonomous mini hydraulic earthmoving backhoe excavator for light duty   construction work . 

 Challenge : 

 The construction of highway , digging of trenches , holes , and foundation requires rapid removal of the   soil . Typically digging machines such as backhoe loaders or known as backhoe excavators , and hydraulic   excavators are used to dig the earth for these applications and to load the material into the dump   trucks , or trolleys . Backhoe excavators are used primarily to excavate below the natural surface of the   ground on which the machine rests . A backhoe excavator is actually three pieces of construction   equipment combined into one unit . These three pieces are a tractor , a loader , and a backhoe as shown   in <NAME> . 1 . 

 <NAME> . 1 A backhoe excavator ( JCB , 2012 ) 

 The backhoe excavators are hues in size and used in the different field of applications . 

 Because of the surge of medium density housing construction , together with changing   regulations have caused builders to rethink construction methods , including the use of   construction equipment . In some cases where homes are built only meters apart , the mobility of   the excavating machines in such compact areas along with the movement of materials , and the   size of the excavating equipment play a crucial role in excavation . This indicates the urgency in   the development of such compact excavation equipment or a compact backhoe excavator 

 attachment which has higher digging depth , dumping height , and digging reach ( collectively   known as kinematic working ranges ) with minimum dimensions so that the machine can be easily   accommodate in the workspace . 

 The so developed compact backhoe attachment parts have to be equally better in strength as the   parts of the heavy duty backhoe loaders are . The controlling of so developed compact backhoe   attachment has to be equally effective as the heavy duty backhoe loaders ’ controlling is . The big   size machines can not be operated for light duty construction work and the manufacturing   companies like caterpillar , JCB , Hitachi , <NAME> <NAME> , <ADDRESS> , Komatsu , Terex , Volvo etc . have   the challenge to develop the compact size autonomous excavating machine which can be   operated not only for light duty construction work but also used for gardening , explosive work   site , higher risky environment , dirty places , waste collection , and where the working environment   is dangerous for human being . 

 Selection : 

 For the development of compact size backhoe excavator , initially it is essential that to know the   name of manufacturers , who are playing leading role in manufacturing of hues size excavating   machines . It is equally important that to collect the technical specifications of all the available   models used in the field . According to Research Methodology concept , the market survey   method is best suitable tool to collect the raw data from the authentic websites of the   manufacturers and their standards available . 

 Survey Method : There are basically two different methods for data collection . One is to conduct   interview and other is to prepare questioner . But in the present problem it is very difficult to   conduct interview and to prepare questioner . But by conducting the survey one can identify the   list of available models of earthmoving machines , their technical specifications and also possible   to compare them . The relevant necessary technical data available on the manufacturer ’s   company websites . Survey method provides the information regarding the available resources ,   technologies , and specifications in context of the present problem . 

 Application : 

 Based on this survey method , the comparison of technical data carried out to identify the Models ,   Operating weight ( kg ) , Engine specification ( hp ) , Working ranges ( mm ) , <NAME> specifications ,   Physical dimensions ( mm ) , <NAME> dimensions ( mm x mm ) etc . 

 The main purpose is to conduct survey is to identify the above mentioned parameters which are very   according to size of machine and model to perform the excavation process below the earth surface .   To develop the compact autonomous model of backhoe excavator it is essential to know the   technical specifications of all the models of the backhoe excavator under the same category . There is   no particular video session on the survey method which can be helpful to conduct the survey for this   kind of problem and application but the basic understanding of survey method understand by   watching youtube video on Survey Research Method by <NAME> <NAME> , Lisbon School of Economics &   Management ,   School of Education ( <URL> ) , and the book on   “ Research Methodology ” by R. C. <NAME> . 

 Insight : 

 The following table shows the basic idea about the collected data through survey method .

 Here only few columns added for example purpose but many numbers of columns and row can be   added according to data size and available information according to problem statement and   objectives made . For the present case of backhoe excavator earthmoving machine , based on   standard sizes ( physical dimensions ) of the backhoe attachment and cylinder dimensions were   decided by applying the scaling rule of design . The bucket specifications were calculated based on   Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) standards , ( i ) SAE J296 : “ Mini excavator and backhoe bucket   volumetric rating ” , an American standard ( <NAME> <NAME> K. , 2006 ) , ( Komatsu , 2006 ) ( ii ) CECE   ( Committee of European Construction Equipment ) a European standard ( <NAME> <NAME> K. , 2006 ) ,   ( Komatsu , 2006 ) . 

 Approach : 

 The current selected approach is to conduct survey for gathering the require information for   comparison purpose to develop a compact autonomous backhoe excavator machine capable to   handle light construction work and other light duty work . Survey method is very time consuming   method to collect the appropriate data and it is very difficult to prove its authenticity , except the 

 data collected from the authentic website , published reports from government body in relevant   field , or any other reliable source . 

 But I think , there is no other alternative approach to collect the data from different sources , and to   do comparison for their parameters and physical dimensions to fulfil the objectives .

"Visualization 

 Challenge      The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , to achieve a shared   understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before   attempting to identify and define possible solutions to the problem . I use this   approach often with our customers , who are government agencies working to   apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their   services to their customer , businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the technique   of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or   prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each   other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and   relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain points and   opportunities for improvements or solutions .     Application     I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To   develop the straw man graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to   understand the environment . The existing material may be operational or   procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials . If materials are not   available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the stakeholders   who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative .     For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each   representing a different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a   poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly , or use   sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , I give   them approximately 15 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic .   Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three questions while   pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I record   commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional insights that come   from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I   digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared   and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that   incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach      I have learned from conducting this activity with several groups is that while the   graphic – especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is   important for reinforcing their understanding of the problem they are working to   solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights and shared   learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem space . The   graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that   allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root   causes of their problems . While they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a   collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump starts the conversation for   them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are   missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key   entities instead of taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in   the problem space – that is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what   areas they need to obtain information or data to provide the values for the variables .     Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and   learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a   series of design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their   combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their   work .

"Reflection - Learning Launch 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I chose to use the Learning Launch tool to help in providing a solution to young   university students desiring to find out their purpose and living it out through campus   and once they leave college . There has been a challenge of most university students   leaving campus and having no idea what to do and especially when they do n’t get jobs   soon after leaving campus . There was a feeling that there is need to create a platform for   them to prepare them for life after campus whether they got employed or ventured into   businesses .   My team and I thought of starting a programme / mentorship program to   provide a holistic approach to life from campus and into the world because we realized   the curriculum in university did not provide for much life skill training . We used this   tool because we needed the students input to come up with a program that serves and   meets their need . 

 Application 

 We started the process by approaching the management team of the 4 campuses we   wanted to work with on the idea and they gave us a go ahead to share our   questionnaires with the students asking them to share their views on what they felt   were some of the things they would like to know or learn that may help them step   confidently into the ‘ world ’ after campus . The questions were open - ended to allow them   freedom to give all responses they felt were relevant to their needs . We wanted to find   out where their pain points were .   Their responses were varied from spiritual   development , networking , financial development , and relationships , personal and   professional development . Others needed guidance on personal , professional and even   leadership development .   We also wanted to know if they would be willing to pay for the   program and how frequent they would like the training to be held . The frequency   needed to align with their school timetable since not all students lived in the same   city / town as the campus and if the program extended beyond the school term , it would   inconvenience some of these students . The questionnaires were given to a total of 400   students from the 4 campuses we had approached and we required the responses in 2   days . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 After receiving the responses from the students , we went through them compiling the   feedback in an exercise to find out if the responses aligned with our assumptions at the   start of the process . To a larger extent , the responses aligned with our assumptions and 

 what did not align we shelved for future use / improvement . Their views and suggestions   were then compiled and we used it to prepare training modules based on the   subjects / topics shared by the students . We were able to develop a 10 - week programme   that covered topics that were very relevant to the students and meeting their need of   life skills development . Class attendance was once a week on a Saturday and the first   season classes were offered for free as a test . We had 250 students in attendance for   Season 1 . The subsequent seasons have seen a growth in student numbers and we have   introduced an affordable fee to cater for snacks and the certification . We added the   certification because the students needed a document to show their participation in the   program . We also chose a central venue that was easily accessible to all the attendees   coming for the training . 

 One of the lessons learned from this process is that the best way to provide relevant and   workable solutions to your audience / customers is to incorporate their views and   concerns while developing a solution for them because they are co - creators in the   process . Listen to their views and concerns as well and convert the information into a   solution . The clients are also willing and happy to be included in the process and they   take up ownership of the process . 

 We also appreciated those who did not agree with our assumptions and their concerns   have been noted and we look forward to use them for further development of the   current program or even use them to develop something new .

"AGILE : Company General Use 

 Challenge and choice      I have a coffee shop that I design with my partner <NAME> . My partner and I were in a meeting with a   designer to choose our logo and shop <NAME> . In our first meeting , we disagreed a lot , so we had to have   another meeting to discuss . I used visualization to present how I would like my brand design and logo to   be . I brought in experienced people to explain our business concepts .      Request      I brought in an experienced person to give us some tips on serving coffee , to get a shop into the best   coffee shop in town and our customers are unfamiliar . Accordingly , our motto should be unique "" Be   different "" . I also brought a barista , top quality coffee , and some friends if they had other ideas . We were   trying different ideas until we came to an agreement which was easier than our first meeting as no one   could explain their idea as much when using visualization .      Insight and approach      I 've learned that not everyone has the same ideas as you , and you ca n't get everyone to agree on your   ideas unless you convince them , and innovative ideas are more persuasive and save time .

"REFLECTION- LEARNING LAUNCH 

 CHALLENGE 

 The challenge that I have taken into consideration is the task of completing a quality submission in   B - School Case competitions . Whenever we start the progress , we would spend much amount of   time in brainstorming and come up with really good insights . But when it comes to presenting them   into the PowerPoint slides , we lost our way . Each time we did the submission at the last minute . The   outcomes were reflected in the form of degraded quality in the presentation slides . These things   cost us heavily and we could n’t make up to the further rounds in many competitions . We are sure   that this has to be changed and we should go in a systematic approach while dealing with case   competitions . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 The design tool that I am selected for solving this challenge is <NAME> <NAME> . We identified the   weak points of submissions which made its quality worse and the timeline framework . Thereafter ,   we made sure that everything competition should be done in more systematic way possible like   having progress update on daily meeting , having some senior experts in the group for proper   guidance and sharing each other deliverables in the WhatsApp group so that if anyone having   objections can raise and clarified then and there . As a whole we identified these changes and put it   in a form of submission process procedure and followed it seriously . 

 APPLICATION 

 A case competition was floated in one of the competitions hosting website ( Dare2Compete ) . This   competition was regarding Entrepreneurship domain . We enrolled ourselves on the first day of the   announcement . We downloaded the case and shared it in the group . The next day onwards we   organized Zoom meetings to kick off the task with Brainstorming about the case . We did this for   almost 3 - 4 days continuously . Each day we come up with new structure of the solution . Once we   decide the solutions , we shared the tasks into sub - tasks and each member is assigned towards it . We   kept an eye on the timeline every time . Also , we identified some of the things did n’t go as planned   and we noted them as well . Finally , we completed the solution on D - day much before the deadline .   This was a huge success to ourselves and we did a quality one . 

 INSIGHTS 

 The insights we gained were worth of doing it . They were explained below : 

 1 . When we go in a systematic way , we get a lot of focus from each member of the group . 

 They seemed actively involved and serious about it . 

 2 . Keeping track of time was very crucial to us to complete the submissions on time .   3 . Assigning tasks are important . Therefore , it should be assigned to the persons who are 

 capable otherwise it will cost the time . 

 4 . Having VC for meetings went well and that made the progress in a good way by 

 interactions . 

 APPROACH 

 Learning Launch was successful in testing the way that we chose is correct or not . We quietly   succeeded in that . In the future , we would like to try some other tools like <NAME> <NAME> for doing   the idea generation and Visualization tool for identifying the problem in a much deeper way   possible . We learnt a lot in the learning launch process and we hope to eradicate those mistakes in   the future and strive to grow hard to achieve success .

"Challenge 

 As part of the digital transformation that we are experiencing in the company where I work   “ Insurance Company ” , it has become critical to know if the changes we make at the   organizational level are really bringing the benefits of value capture . For this we have chosen to   use the methodology of OKRS ( Objective and Key Results ) , more detail of this methodology can   be found in the book by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> "" Measure what Matters "" . As an Agile Coach ,   the problem I have identified is that it has become very difficult to teach leaders how to change   their measurement perspective towards OKRs , in this sense we need to instruct our leaders in   an easy way that allows them to understand how to correctly define OKRs . This is critical because   without correctly defined OKRs we will not have alignment with the objectives and results that   the company pursues . 

 Selection 

 The tool I have chosen to use to solve this problem is visualization , since making leaders   understand these new concepts with graphic and personalized examples will help them to   understand much better . 

 Application 

 To apply the visualization tool in teaching OKRs to business leaders , the first thing I did was   develop practical examples of everyday life converted with images that help spark the   imagination ( the best understood example was about a car and how to get from point A to point   B as a target , and its different forms of measurement such as elapsed time , elapsed kilometers ,   gasoline , speed , oil , etc . ) . As a second point , I asked the leaders to use graphs to determine the   objectives of their respective units . Once the objectives were plotted , they were asked to try to   graph the metrics ( KRs ) according to the selected objective . Finally , we convert all the graphics   made into text with the format corresponding to the OKRs . It was a complete success and the   workshop lasted 3 hours ( normally it took us a whole day to be able to teach an OKRs workshop ) . 

 Insight 

 From my perspective , using visualization as a teaching method has defined a before and after , I   am convinced that it arouses the interest of the participants much more and creates a single   understanding of the subject , the best thing is that it allows simple explanation of very complex   topics that It could take hours if you just rely on theory . In addition to this , what seems incredible   to me is that you do not have to be a great draftsman to be able to develop this tool , it is enough   that you awaken your imagination and begin to sketch what you know theoretically to graphics   that can be from sticks , geometric figures , stick figures , etc . 

 Approach 

 I have realized that visualization can be complemented very well with the <NAME> technique ,   in fact for my next sessions I have thought about being able to develop the graphic examples   with simple stories where the actor can be any collaborator of the company and the examples   would be the situations that we go through day by day in our work . In this way I consider that it   could further improve the development of cognitive abilities that we want in our leaders .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I work for an organization which is aiming at developing capabilities of employees with which we could   become an organization where an employee would meet the needs of the job and perform at an   optimal level and at the same time also aligning this to the objectives of the organization so that the   organization as a whole will meet the existing and upcoming capability needs in the industry . We ’ve   used multiple design thinking tools to develop a platform to meet all the learning needs both within   the job role and outside the job role . Now as we have traditional practices of learning in our   organization and we want to digitize the learning and provide a good experience for any employee   visiting the platform . 

 As a team , we ’ve worked towards building a platform that meets the learning needs of employees at   various levels . As part of this we ’ve explored few vendors using design thinking principles such as   brainstorming , journey mapping etc . And after this we wanted to test this on some real time users . 

 Application 

 As part of this we ’ve created a test on two platforms and brought in few real time users and asked   them to experience both the platforms . The next step is collecting the feedback on both the   platforms where we wanted to understand the accessibility , navigation , ease of use and how this   platform is meeting the needs of the end user , etc . during this phase , we ’ve interacted with the end   users who comes with various backgrounds and how the platform is meeting their requirements .   With this activity we could visualize the journey and get a complete view on how to make effective   use of the platform and also the problems that would arise in future . 

 Insight 

 This exercise helped us in shortlisting the most suitable platform . Also helped us in understanding   how an end user will make use of the features available in terms of accessing the content , creating   journeys , leader boards , gamification etc . this platform encouraged individuals to create   personalized learning journeys and also it was enabled with proper tracking mechanism . While   individuals created their own journeys and is specific to his / her role and here comes the challenge of   learning activities available on the platform . As these learning activities are generic in nature and not   solving the deeper problems , there could be a high possibility of employees getting disengaged with   the available content . At the same time the learning activities available would solve a major problem   of the org . as these activities though not highly technical but would definitely meet a certain   requirement for the development of any individual . 

 Approach 

 Basis the feedback and inputs received from various stakeholders , we ’ve brought in various changes   on the platform including major changes related to user experience in terms of accessibility ,   navigation , and also for the content part we ’ve worked with other vendors who can host their   content on our platform and this will definitely solve the bigger purpose of the organization and   hence creating a learning organization . And thus providing the best learning resources for the   development of the individuals which in turn will bring out in the form of skills and behaviour   enrichment .

 Final Assignment : Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I am a freelance Digital Marketing Consultant , with focus on Social Media . I used the   Visualization tool in a project of a client of mine ; let ’s call him Health Shop ( for Privacy   reasons ) . Health Shop is a well - established physical retail store in a small town . Health Shop   sells everything you need for your well - being , from head to toe , and they specialize in   alternative fitness methods as well as oral hygiene . Two years ago they launched an online   shop , with poor sales so far . The consulted me in order to figure out their Omnichannel    Marketing strategy as the team was n’t in the digital natives category ( all of them in their 50s )   and neither did they know how nor did they want to use the new media . 

 It was a difficult task for me , because before I could even start and plan out a digital strategy   for them , I had to convince the Management and make them understand that the Marketing   of today is different than the Marketing they had learned a couple of decades ago . Most of   them were also reluctant to Social Media platforms such as Facebook and <NAME> ; they had   Privacy and Security concerns , did n’t use them in their free time and thought it was just   “ something for the kiddies ” . 

 I decided to set up a meeting with all the stakeholders : owners , management , employees   and to make it more of a workshop than a traditional gathering . I knew that before I could lay   out my digital strategy for their business , I first had to make them understand how Marketing   and Social Media “ tick ” nowadays . They were a tough crowd , and I decided that instead of   having me talk for one hour straight or even more , I would have them participate in a   workshop about Social Media and Digital Communication . Visualization would help them   understand this new , exciting world much better , the tool would make sure that we are all   talking about the same thing and stay focused and in line . 

 Application 

 All stakeholders of the Health Shop participated in the workshop ; I gathered the small team   of five in the shop on a Saturday afternoon .   A big , round table was moved and placed in the   middle of the shop in order for every participant to have an open and flowing communication   with everybody else . I set up two white boards , each of them equipped with markers and   post - its in different colors . 

 Part I of the workshop : On the top of the left white board I placed a sign with the word   “ classic ” on it . On the right board the sign had written the word “ digital ” on it . I then drew a   simple , big stickman , on   both of those boards and asked each of them to think about their   customer life cycle and write each thought that comes to mind ( I set a maximum of three   words ) on a post - it note . Every participant was assigned to a specific color of post - its , in   order to keep them apart . I gave them 10 minutes and then they put their notes onto the   drawing of the stick man and connect their post - its ( thoughts ) with an arrow in order to have   the full cycle . 

 We discussed every created cycle shortly and then grouped the similar thoughts in patterns :   explore , consider , buy , use and so on . This was also done with the help of visualization tools ,   as I drew a map of this customer journey on the board and placed the post - its with a similar   meaning together in groups . 

 Part II : Then , it was my turn to focus on each of those groups we had created and stress out   the few similarities , but most importantly , the differences between the classic marketing and   the digital one . For this purpose I used again visualization in form of video and images from   social media channels and successful strategies of well - known brands which were in the   same business as my client . Along the way , I re - explained important keywords such as   “ reach ” , “ engagement ” , “ virality ” , “ digital authenticity ” , “ community ” and so on . 

 Part III ( final ): We repeated the first part of the workshop on the right board , the “ digital ” one ,   but now the team used the knowledge and insights they had gathered from the discussion in   Part II . The ideas and thoughts that were shared after completing this part were more than   amazing ! The team appeared to understand that Social Media are not just a game or a   means to share cat content , that communication is now a two way street , with much more   customer touch points and that in order to succeed in the Omnichannel business they had to   re - think and re - set their marketing approach . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 To be honest , it was the first time I used Design Thinking Tools , and the first time I had a   workshop like this ! It surely wo n’t be the last time ! The visualization tool helps to bring your   point across , everyone jumps onboard and participates ; no matter if it is the boss of the   company or the intern , they all work together and brainstorm as a group . The visuals help   stakeholders to focus on the task at hand , it supports them in their thinking process and I   believe it simplifies the problem , regardless of its complexity . It also helps identify weak   areas of an organization or team , as it makes deficiencies or difficulties more clear . I will use   surely use this tool again , in combination with storytelling especially if I have to solve a   problem on multiple levels .

"<NAME> : Company General Use 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of my organization ’s online marketing department and my / our challenge is to improve   the workflow ( activities and projects ) within the department in order to increase sales in the online   channel and to spend marketing budgets on the right campaigns . The project scope includes the online   marketing department composed of ten employees , as well as the larger marketing department and IT   department , with whom we work closely . The project is limited to internal resources ( i.e. , budget and   employee time ) . The project should not exceed 30 business days and the solution should include an   even distribution of working hours amongst the team members . We will focus on trying to uncover what   our team members , as well as key stakeholders within the larger marketing department and IT   department , consider to be ineffective or problematic with regard to the workflow . 

 Selection 

 Our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools , so we are ready to try the   learning launch tool . Broadly speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an   idea and prototype . 

 Application 

 For our first learning launch , we focused on the structure / execution of our online marketing tasks . In   particular , we wanted to see if we could structure our tasks , projects , and processes to adapt the   methods of Scrum project management for our work ( e.g. , time boxed , daily , specific meetings , reviews ,   etc . ) in an effort to become more agile . This tested our assumption that the structure and execution   were the main causes of our workflow challenge . Our team went through a two - day training with a   Scrum project management coach . Next , we went through five workshops to structure our tasks and   processes in a more agile way . These two sessions occurred within in a three - week timeframe . We   expected to produce a document with a clear description of our new , more agile processes / workflow .   For our second learning launch , we focused on gaining clarity about our tasks and priorities . This tested   our assumption that our prioritization of tasks was the main cause of our workflow challenge . Our team   completed an anonymous survey . Additionally , five key stakeholders from the larger marketing   department and IT department also completed an anonymous survey . The surveys included questions   about our new , proposed process , understanding the process and the prioritization of tasks , and feelings   about the change , and were conducted within a one - week timeframe . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified our assumptions and designed launches to test   these assumptions . Additionally , we thought through anticipated results , expecting to find that a more   agile approach would improve our workflow , and that both our team and the key stakeholders would be   fairly open to the new prioritization of tasks and process . Our actual results were slightly different from   what we anticipated : while our team was open to the prioritization of tasks and process , the key   stakeholders in the larger marketing department and IT department expressed some concerns . Moving   forward , our team will review this insight and incorporate it into future launch designs . The ongoing   incorporation of insight is particularly important at this stage , as launches come before a full rollout in   the design thinking timeline . 

 <NAME> : Company General Use 

 Approach 

 Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools and are at this   stage in the timeline , the learning launch is the appropriate tool . As previously mentioned , our team   needs to review the insight gained from our first two launches and incorporate this insight into future   launch designs . Future launch designs should reflect insight gained , progress made , and come closer to a   compelling solution ready for full rollout 

"
"Challenge & Selection : 

 <NAME> is very effective tool . It connects the people . It is always easier to understand the complex   issues by having more relative examples . I lead the team of design engineers who works on the different   project on daily basis . Although projects are different but the issues are almost the same what my senior   colleagues have already faced . Whenever I meet my seniors I try to discuss these issues and they come   up with the similar experience they faced previously . 

 During our weekly meeting , I shared the story of the similar issues faced by our senior colleague and it   really helped the team to understand the issue very well . They asked some relevant questions and I   answered them based on the same context with my experience on similar issue . Frequently I used this   method to solve these individual issues . And discuss this with the team overall . 

 Application : 

 I remember one instance , we were in the project kick off meeting and discussing the new project . 

 I was explaining the project scope and critical areas where we need to focus . Similar project I handled it   two years back . And I was knowing the some deviations which will certainly come during the detailed   design phase of the project . The team was thinking in a usual design way . I told them the story how one   project requirement changed the complete design and I had to worked from scratch again . It consumed   a lot of time and efforts . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 In actual the real problems was the project design specifications requirement , which was actually   obsolete and was not available in the market . So when my initial design was complete . Our procurement   team told me that if we go with this particular requirement the project delivery will be delayed by 4   months at least . Which will have negative impact on overall project hand over . I communicated with the   client and redesign the whole project with alternate specifications . Client accepted it . And we completed   the project on time . 

 I told the same story to my team . It helped them . They changed the approach to the design and finally   we were able to complete the project ahead in time . 

 Well , this course have gave me the different insight of the same story telling . And now I can prepare   myself to be more accurate and prepared well with the compelling story.so that it would have the good   impact on the team .

 THE CORE VALUES THAT I HAVE LEARNT FROM THIS COURSE : ; 

"
"Reflection – Visualization in device graphics 

 Challenge & Selection    The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding   of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define   possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach within organization for talks with cross   functional teams , who are working in different departments working to apply scientific or technology   innovations for pharmaceutical development . I have used the technique of using a device visualization   of a problem domain with a set of details of each part for discussion to allow a diverse group of   stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements ,   and relationships between elements to consider when identifying device points and opportunities for   improvements or solutions .      Application    I start the process by creating a device graphic of the problem domain . To develop the device graphic ,   I draw the device design from existing knowledge on available material to understand the design . The   existing knowledge talks about procedural documents , study results on various tested device , or other   auditing reports .      The design details were not available , then I conduct informal interviews with two of the stakeholders   who serve as my main points of contact on the study initiative . The results were available for four   tested devices . However , the understanding on the data was not being easy for all the involved   stakeholders . Thus , comparative assessment was made simple through graphics , using simple shapes   and icons . Process flow was used along with animations for the visualisation and easy understanding   for different stakeholders including clinical team .      The visualisation approach helped to clarify the doubts of all stakeholders with whom we had   interaction that enable the organization to provide the timely completion of activities .    The template I often start with the rationale , requirements and then design basics that will resolve   the doubts on how to operate the device .      For the activity , we had stakeholders ( 8 - 9 ) each representing a different function or department in   organization or area of interest . Each group received an invite to join the meeting for direct interaction   and also provided sticky notes to make comments .    I have explained them design graphics for 20 minutes and asked for questions to clear the doubts , if   any . Then the major question on clinical aspect and impact on clinical study was discussed and the   doubts were clarified with risk assessment .      Insight & Approach    What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several stakeholders is that while the graphic   – especially the animation for visualisation – is important for easy understanding of the problem that   we are working to solve . The animation gives the diverse group of stakeholders a clear picture on the   facts and data that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential risk if   any . The more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights and shared learning that occurs   while we are working to define the problem space . They can quickly identify where they are in the   graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about device design and key   entities of it instead of taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem   space – that is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain   information or data to provide the values for the variables .    Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would   use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities .

"THE CHALLENGE : 

 Forecasting Collection pattern of customers amid COVID 19 ’ lockdown . 

 <NAME> has struck , we are working out the ways to reach to the customers to know the customers mindset . 

 With the government getting into the picture by floating the guidelines for moratorium , it becomes a additional challenge to make the customers and our own team understand them the pros and cons of moratorium scheme . 

 This problem seems the perfect example of design thinking problem where we find the problem is human centric , problem could not be clearly understood with high level of uncertainty . 

 SELECTION : 

 To initiate solving this challenge , GOOGLE DESIGN SPRINTS seems relevant , where post understanding the issue thoroughly , by DIVERGING , we did brainstorming with my team in various combination through con - call with HO - CH , CH - DM , DM - ABM , ABM - EXE & Combination of all . From the discussions we came out of numerous of ideas , few of workable listed below : 

  We should list down and study the profile of customers funded . 

  Every profile to be grouped into high , medium & low impact out of the prevailing challenge of lockdown . 

  To ascertain the percentage of customer comes into low impact with available online repayment option with them to help collecting their dues . 

  Customer with funds available in their account and willing to pay through ACH mode . 

 APPLICATION : 

 Post accessing available tool and help of competencies of the manpower , a PROTOTYPE was developed in form of Customer feedback form . Later the same was tested to the small group of customers and basis its acceptability it was applied for entire 20 K customers of my <ADDRESS> . 

 Customer feedback form was smartly prepared so that it gave us the required information , the learning of design thing was applied like what we know , what we do n’t know , what we need to know . 

 INSIGHT : 

 While looking at the insight ’s received , we came to know ‘ WHAT WOW ’s ’ . We got to know the following pattern of repayments from customers . 

  Most of the customers were not opting for moratorium , which was contradicts our previous assumption . 

  Still the challenge remains unsolved since due to uncertainty many of the customers feedbacks were conditional . 

 So while preparing the workable solution , we finally thought of ‘ WHAT WORKS ’ . 

 APPROACH : 

 We are going ahead with sending our customers with the link to pay online along with we have the list of customers which are having cash payments with them which can be collected as soon as the lockdown is lifted . 

 Apart from this we have also prepared the list of customer who has balance in their account and we will present their ACH in bank shortly .

"Implementation of Master Data Governance Tool for a Multinational company for better managing   their business process through ERP systems 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 We were to implement the Master Data Governance tool for a multinational giant for managing its master   data need for its ERP system . The tool was already decided . We were given a task to implement the tools   with standard feature the tool offers . 

 The challenge was , we were not having the clear idea about requirements Or expectations other than to   ensure all standard feature of the tool should be configured . The master data was maintained discretely   my multiple departments across multiple functions within the organization . 

 There was no much information readily available on the present processes being used to maintain the   data in that organization , the challenges which were being faced for managing such vast master data were   not centrally available . There is not definite place where in all the related information would be made   available to us . 

 We decided to have a blueprinting exercise ( Visualization technique ) to understand the requirements   better by reaching out to key stakeholders spread across multiple departments , interact with them and   get more information about the practices they were following , their expectations from the new tool what   could be done better to make their life easier in maintaining the data in much better manner and easier   way . The aim was also to understand their pain points and give a better means for carrying out their work   other than just implementing the standard toll with its given features . 

 Application : 

 We prepared the format with a set of questions to understand the way the data maintenance being   carried out of responsible persons , the volumes of data being managed by them , frequency at which this   activity needs to be carried out , challenges they were facing in carrying out this seemingly monotonous   activity . We identified key stakeholders from respective departments who had good knowledge of   business and who could give us the clear picture of present state in master data . 

 Post circulating these questionnaires and asking them to fill up , then we conducted one to one session   with these stakeholders ( AS - IS sessions ) , reviewed the questionnaire filled up by them and then   understanding from then what challenged they were facing other that what we had asked for . What were   the key points which they felt should be addressed or would be most critical to get addressed with the   help of new tool . What kind of governance structure / approval mechanism they were expecting from the   tool . 

 After collating all the information and segregation of related data , we then prepared the proposed   solution ( in the form of documentation and presentation ) and swim lane diagrams . Each process was   clearly mapped using the swim lane identifying the inputs / out puts and process flow for each step . 

 We clearly documented the requirements which could be addressed , and which were not possible using   the tool . 

 This was then presented to same set of stakeholders , giving them the picture of what would be the   solution which will be available to them after the tool is implemented .   These were all interactive session   and we ensured that they are having the clear picture of what is being offered to them and addressed   their queries . This verified To - Be process was then taken to next stage , where the solution was developed/   configured and them tested along with these stake holders to get their feedback . 

 Insite and Approach : 

 -   We made small group of key people with good understanding of business . This immensely helped   us in getting a clear picture of how the business was being conducted in that organization . 

 -   Having a set of questions help in getting a structured information from multiple departments and   we would then collate this information and could arriving in making a common understanding and   generic requirement across all departments . This also helped us to clearly note down the unique   requirements from different departments . 

 -   We could get additional information and undisclosed information/ expectation from users in   informal discussions with these select group of people 

 -   The To - Be session with swim lane diagrams helped in giving a very clear picture of what could be   the new solution which business can expect . This helped them to then pin point shortcomings and   give more valuable ideas , which they could not give during AS - IS sessions .

"Challenge 

 I am the operations manager for my international company ’s Asian business .   We service the engineering and   architectural design industry and my staff consists of 50 people spread over 6 departments . 

 We have had just over 5 years of rapid growth with some major success , but I have noticed recently a lack of   production and a decline in quality . To our credit we have retained the majority of our staff over our time of   operations therefore I needed to analyze the current state of operations , our projects and production to determine   what was first failing , and second how to fix the issues . 

 Part of my role was to restructure the company in an effort to improve efficiencies , production and sales .   To do this   required me to gather the key stakeholders across our departments to determine what we considered to be ineffective   or problematic with regard to the business . 

 There have been many times over the years where we have addresses some issues in an isolated context and have   generally used assumptions and biases to propose solutions which in general have had limited affects . Our team has   already gone through several design thinking activities / tools , so we are ready to try the learning launch tool . 

 Selection 

 I plan to keep the learning launch experimental meant to quickly test an idea and prototype quickly , seeing results   ( positive or negative ) early . 

 Application 

 In the weeks leading up to what I planned would be a learning launch , I individually interviewed each department ,   spending time watching how they interacted with their counterparts in other countries and within their team .   Independently of all of the departments I used SWOT analysis to identify common and unique strengths , weaknesses   opportunities and threats that I could use as a basis for initiating agile projects aimed at addressing the outcomes . 

 Along with my SWOT points , I set some very generic goals but left the path for getting to that goal undefined as I   required the input and experimentation from all stakeholders to define the path for itself . 

 I was determined to set the culture not only for the experiment and project but for the entire office . To do so required   me to loosely plan the approach with the key stakeholders , so together we determined some "" organizational tenets ”   that would keep us on task towards the goal , but would not allow us to be manipulated with bias . The ended up   being : 

 •   Realization of the past , present & future    Now is the time to reflect on our purpose , we need a bold direction , and to marshal as a team toward   that goal , we will prioritize everything we do accordingly . Sustaining a forward - looking view .   •   Focus on the way things are done , not the structure .   While org charts are important to define some of the formal building blocks , we can not try and force   our business processes into a structure that does not suit reality . We will fix our structure last because   defining a structure will not fix the problem . We focus on execution improvement regardless of role to   a certain point , and revisit structure after ,   •   Make the most of our top talent   We design positions and roles to suit our talent , we respect commitment and determination and   implement training strategy to help them meet their aspirations where skill is lacking . We optimize   management by minimizing direct reports with the goal for every level of management to essentially   “ replace themselves ” that is the true gauge of their success as managers .      •   Focus on the controllable   There are issues we are aware of companywide that in the immediate term we can not control . That   does not mean we can not influence them or aim to fix them long term , but while we are focusing on 

 issues that are out of our control we will not fix things that are . We need to aim as a group to be second   to none in our duties before we can begin to fix others .      •   Accountability is paramount and will be rewarded   People will be accountable for their past and present work without being micromanaged . We will apply   RACI to everything we do , and it is those that strive to perform when responsible and manage when   accountable that we will foster for the future .       •   We do not benchmark ourselves against anyone else .   We have a unique business model with a set of goals and values that are no one else ’s , We need to   identify internally how we benchmark success as a business and what our products are required to be .   We do not take superficial competitor pricing as a benchmark for ourselves without first making an   informed business decision based on fact . We have an identity that is entwined with a business model .      •   Our organizational structure fits our purpose .   Traditionally we have been weak matrixed where we need to be balanced , we need our functional   managers and departments but we must put more focus on the project team . This will not happen by   itself , the leader of the project must stand up , be accountable and take charge .       •   Higher value on the informal   There is a lot of value in our formal processes , they are crucial to process and production . However I   want a strong focus to be on the informal , intrinsic motivation of our teams . Transparency and honesty   between business units is paramount and I expect to be aske anything and everything while being told   everything . The office junior should be told the big picture , while sharing their thoughts and concerns   on production .      •   Acknowledgement and exploitation of strength .   After 5 years of production and growth , we have tried many things .   At this point we have a good   understanding of what our strengths are ( see SWOT ) complimentary to “ focusing on the controllable ”   we need a sustained period of getting better at what we are already good at . This will mean putting   some long term goals on the shelf , but ultimately we will be more prepared for them in the future .                     Being guided by the tenets , the key stakeholders were given weekly tasks which were designed to address the   SWOT , goals and issues . These weekly experiments were small enough to not cause an impact but were discussed   informally followed up by an evaluation to determine their success and the approach for the next weeks tasks . 

 Insight 

 By being allowed to fail / succeed early with a higher value on observation and the informal over a document heavy   workflow , the buy in by the entire office is a lot more positive than it has been in the past . The teams see the instant   results of an initiative without the negative thoughts that usually meet “ yet another procedure ” 

 I am happy to say that after 2 months of this approach we have already met 4/14 of our major goals , and are well on   the way to meeting all of our targets by the end of the year . 

 I can honestly say that an open mind , in line with design thinking we are a lot more agile and adaptable to change . 

 Approach 

 I will continue to use design thinking to reach larger focused goals , as the only thing that is certain in any   organization is that there is uncertainty , design thinking allows for what is usually a negative ( uncertainty ) to be   used for the improvement of an organization .

"Mind mapping is one of the most powerful tools in the design thinker 's toolbox . Before moving to the   next phase , what if , we need to distill all that data into information and insights that can be easily   communicated . <NAME> <NAME> is a graphical and pictorial illustration of the interrelated ideas for a common   goal or objective . It truly makes its mark for empowering imagination to produce new theme of ideas .   <NAME> <NAME> drives people , with a multi - dimensional approach , to generate a consolidated and   concentric solution to the problem . Mind mapping is a great tool to plan , gather ideas and generate   a possible outcome for a common objective . 

 A Mind Map is an outstanding approach to communicating and team up with others to develop plans or   accomplish key project milestones in an organized way . It allows a person to harness the input of all   members of a group in a dynamic and creative way . 

 I was appointed as a project manager in a team . It was a challenging project to plan and implement in a   shorter time ( tight schedule ) with budget constraints and limited resources . The project was to implement   Project Management Portfolio solution for the PMO . It was an integration of more than seven ( 7 )   software along with customization of software as per demand and requirement . <NAME> <NAME> for   Project team were : 

 1-       RFQ document was missing with several key information . 

 2-       Project was a new venture and project for a consulting company . 

 3-       Project team was comprised of an enthusiast and expert professionals , but new to plan and   implement such type of project . 

 I was engaged in imparting training and facilitate the Brainstorming session . I developed the mind map to   highlight the project requirements , scope , schedule , and cost along with high - level Risks . At that point   had a nitty gritty dialog and contentions with a project team . During a brainstorming session , we   challenged each other i.e. facilitator and project team . The workshop ended with clear objectives , roles ,   and responsibilities for every project team member . Every project team member was on the same page   regarding the project scope and high - level Risks . Mind mapping workshop facilitation helped Project   team to deliver the project on time within budget . when I want to do something analytical , I make a list .   When I 'm trying to do something creative , I make a mind - map . In design thinking I use the mind mapping   process to capture and represent the minds of our customers . I involve our colleagues in order to develop   a common mind among them regarding the current reality of a design challenge . Through mind mapping ,   I extract meaning from data in a way that lets patterns and insights emerge . 

 It 's used to look for patterns , it 's used to look for insights , that lead to more creative solutions to your   design challenge . That ’s why I would again use it .

 Design Thinking for Innovation 

 January 16 , 2021 

 Challenge 

 We all love to eat good food . Cooking good food at home is not always feasible .   Sometimes we want to taste diferent good food from diferent sources . We visit our   nearest restaurants , food shops , travel to diferent regions , and taste diferent cuisine .   We also love to have good food delivered to their homes . 

 In the COVID-19 pandemic , the situation is changed . The demand for food delivery   services is geting higher . we use the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to   understand and know the users ' pain points , come up with user - friendly and   functional solutions . 

 Selection 

 Visualization is one of the very important tools . It is a core component of the way to   communicate . It allows us to think in a nonverbal way . Designing a food delivery service   involves diferent groups of people . Food makers , delivery persons , and users of the   service are the indispensable parts of the service . 

 We will focus on trying to uncover what they think , speak and do . And also use   technology to ensure seamless food delivery service and experience . We take   inspiration from diferent resources . "" The Good Kitchen "" story mentioned at the very   beginning of the course is one of them .    ( <URL> ) 

 Application 

 Before diving down to the core we tried to understand the current scenario frst . We   identifed the targeted users and the stakeholders to fnd answers to some very   important questions . 

 Who they are ? Where they live ? What are the problems and how they face them now ?   How they address and communicate ? What solutions they currently have and how   they use them ? What are the pain points and experiences ? What are their   expectations ? 

 Peer - graded Assignment : Refection Page 2 

 We divided the stakeholders into small groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a   diferent organization or area of interest . We asked them diferent set questions . Learn   about their interests . We approached them with our diferent ideas to collect their   feedback . We used visualization tools to describe the ideas . We sketch plots , used   images , design dialog between the characters . We let the participants make   comments on it . We also conducted some interactive sessions individually and   collectively . Those helped us to get important insights . 

 Insight 

 By applying the visualization tool , we identifed our assumptions and designed stories   to test these assumptions . Additionally , we thought through anticipated results ,   expecting to fnd that a more agile approach would improve our workfow . We 've   documented the learnings and insights from the sessions . The visualization tool helps   us to understand stakeholders ' perspectives and develop insights into potential root   causes of their problems . Moving forward , we will review this insight and incorporate it   into future sessions . 

 Approach 

 We have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups , incorporates   feedback , understanding of the problem , shared insights , and shared learning . Since   we have discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning ,   next time we would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of   design thinking activities .

"Reflection – Visualisation 

 Challenge – Design thinking emphasizes the importance of deep exploration into the   lives and the problems of the people we hope to generate value for before we are   allowed to start generating solutions . This is why it ’s actually user - defined design .   Visualisation is actually more tangible and concrete sort of process for design   thinking . Visualisation does not mean drawing a picture . Visualisation is much more   beyond drawing a picture in mind but actually making impact to bring change in our   daily routine . When we are actually dealing with problems we just not attempt to   solve problems but also try to find logic behind it . Therefore , the main challenge that   we face is just not to find solutions to problems but also to find the possibilities that   we have not yet seen .      Selection – I have selected visualisation because have seen the recent changes   that has Visualisation is anything we write on a chalkboard , whiteboard , to   PowerPoint presentation to photography video . It is actually that takes you beyond   just using words or language alone . In recent times , I have seen that due to covid-19   issues many home entrepreneurs have come across . People became so innovative   in their ideas just sitting at home and coming up with variety of ideas in starting up   their business right away through offline and online mode .      Application – We can see that during this covid-19 many new home entrepreneurs   have come into business with new innovative ideas . People have become so   innovative that their minds are not just set to sell products or sell foods but also to   create an impact on their perspective customers .   Take for example- 

  For home bakers – Earlier people used to be dependent on bakery 

 shops for bakery items but now everyone is so well trained and   talented that the product line has changed , for e.g. – customised   cakes , unique flavours cookies and cakes , with beautiful exotic   decorations , online advertisements through social media . Instagram   being the most active social media at present , new business   entrepreneurs are of motive to gain popularity , fame through launching   their own business profiles through customers can directly contact   them for orders , feedback about the orders people purchase , creating   videos , reels give them extra exposure .    We can clearly see that visualisation as a design thinking tool has been   very logically applied in this concept . Many new entrepreneurs are not   just limited to social media postings but also has spread their wings   wide apart by distributing pamphlets with beautiful slogans to advertise   their brand to gain everybody ’s attention . Customers share profiles   online .    Nowadays reels and visual videos are so common that they also help a   lot in creating awareness about the new post of cakes so made by the   owner itself . 

 Not only this friends and family are also so involved in promotional   activities that not just by saying but reference also helps a lot .    Visualisation as such helps a lot to new ventures like this to gain   market access quiet easily and capture the attention of customers . 

 Insight & Approach – With this I have learned from conducting this exercise it has   incorporated the importance for reinforcing their understanding of the problem which   earlier new business owners had to face , like gaining popularity in the market was   not so easy as compared to present scenario , then customer feedback being one of   the major part to be handled very sincerely has been made possible with the help of   social media posts and being on whatsapp . The main motive is to gain maximum   profit out of the available resources and making best use of the available resources .   Then the revised visualisation graphics and models that incorporates their combined   feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of the work .

"Reflection Learning Launch “ Hand luggage at the gate ” 

 Challenge 

 I am working as an operations manager for a European airline . The challenge for our team is to   improve the passenger flow in the aircraft during the boarding process to increase the punctuality   of departing narrow body aircraft . In the current situation there is a problem with the amount and   volume of hand luggage that passengers carry with them when they show up at the gate for   boarding . Most of the passengers ( around 75 % ) are so called transfer passengers that have   arrived with a long - haul flight in a wide body aircraft ( often operated by a partner airline with less   stringent rules for hand luggage ) to our airport . They typically transfer to a short haul flight which   is operated with a narrow body aircraft . These aircraft have a more limited luggage capacity in the   overhead bins compared to the wide body aircraft and when the departing narrow - body flights are   fully booked the total amount of hand luggage of all passengers does not fit in the overhead bins .   This does not only lead to discussions with the crew on board of the aircraft , it also delays the   boarding process and thus the departure of the flight as the overflow of hand luggage needs to be   removed from the passenger cabin , brought to the ramp where it gets loaded in the belly of the   aircraft . 

 Selection 

 The tool our team selected to explore and test ideas to improve the situation is the “ learning   launch ” tool . This design tool is focused on doing fast and cheap experiments ( so called learning   launches ) to test hypothesis and obtain data to determine whether key assumptions are true and   learn if ideas are good . 

 The reason we selected this tool is that it is relatively easy and effective to apply in our situation .   We realized we could do cheap experiments by applying small modifications to our boarding   process to test our hypothesis with real customers with a small group of gates / flights . And we can   evaluate the results by comparing it with similar flights applying the unmodified / standard   boarding process . This way we can objectively see what works and what does not work . 

 Application 

 How did we apply the learning launch tool ? With a small team of employees , we first observed   the current boarding process of several departing narrow body flights to identify what we believed   were the key problem areas . This gave us a better understanding of the key issues that we   believed led to delays in the boarding process . 

 The next thing we did with the team was generating ideas how we could potentially streamline the   boarding process by attacking the key issues we observed . In a couple of hours , we came to a   list of around 10 ideas that we thought would be interesting . To validate our ideas and the   underlying assumptions we decided to test them in practice one by one by applying small process   changes and observe the effect in practice . 

 As an example , we learned from observing the regular boarding process that most passengers   do not realize that smaller carry - on luggage items can be placed under the seat in front of them in   the cabin . We assumed that by making passengers more aware of this option we could change   their behavior and increase the use of this solution which would leave more space available in the   overhead luggage bins for the larger items . 

 We decided to test this hypothesis by pro - actively approaching passengers waiting in the gate   area before boarding to explain our test and request them to put their smaller items under the   seat in front of them once they arrived at their seat in the aircraft . To increase their awareness   and remind them of this option , we created special blue colored labels which we attached to   those smaller hand luggage items that would fit underneath a seat . We tested this on 20   departing flights and noticed an average reduction of the overall boarding process lead - time with   5 minutes ( compared to similar flights using the standard boarding process ) due to a better flow   in the aircraft . Based on this successful experiment we decided to scale the use of the special   blue hand luggage label on all our departing narrow body flights . This solution is still in use today   and works very well . 

 Insight 

 The learning launch tool worked very well in this situation . We were able to quickly test our   hypothesis in practice and observe the effects of our process modifications in real time . We   realized that using the gate area environment is actually a very practical and cheap way to create   our own “ test laboratory ” . For some reason we had never thought of this option before . In   addition , passengers found it very interesting to participate in the experiments we did because   they fully recognized the pain points we tried to solve and felt recognized as valuable customers . 

 What turned out to be difficult in this set up was to get quick feedback from passengers on how   they experienced the process modifications . Soon after they boarded the aircraft the aircraft   doors were closed , and the aircraft left . Of course , we could have asked them to fill in a   questionnaire on board of the aircraft ( with assistance of the cabin crew ) but that would have   created quite an administrative burden and would not lead to a quick feedback process . 

 Approach 

 What we did not realize at first , is that it would have been interesting to use the same learning   launch tool but actively involve passengers more upfront in the process during brainstorming on   ideas to improve the situation . This would probably have taught us quicker which process   modifications would be embraced by the passengers easily , and which modifications would   probably be more challenging to implement or even would not lead to success . This could have   saves us from doing some experiments that turned out not be successful after all . 

 So , in a next round of learning launches we will involve customers in the early stages of our   experiments to identify those ideas that have the highest probability to be implemented   successfully .

"Reflection 

 Challenge 

 I have trouble keeping track of my own thoughts . Although by the end of my sentences I deliver the   message I intend to deliver , it usually takes me more time than it would take my teammates or   colleagues since I lose my train of thought or I go on into different topics to give examples or clarify the   current topic . I am a student , and I am currently finalizing a business project with my teammates . The   challenge we had at first was to be on the same page about all the processes and the details of the   project before starting . This was during finals period , so we all had different projects and exams to tend   to so we were to use our time very efficiently . For this , I had to tell them how I intended the project to   look like during the preparation phase and after launch without wasting any precious time . 

 Selection 

 The visualization tool stood up to me at first because of its simplicity and usefulness . Being able to put   your thoughts into shapes and colors to convey a message is not only interesting but it has also been my   go - to during note taking and mind - mapping . 

 So , I selected the visualization tool because I have been using it a lot even before taking this course   because of how well it works for me . Seeing how powerful a tool it is in business , I wanted to use it   correctly and with the intention of using it for a purpose and not simply because I like it . In short , I tried   using it strategically this time . 

 Application 

 For each of our meetings to discuss and elaborate on the project , my teammates and I depended almost   fully on visualization to get our ideas through . When discussing the supply chain process , we used visual   aids like drawing on paper , using online visual aids like icons and arrows . We also used a lot of diagrams   for details about the delegation of work . Through visual borders we were able to separate what we   could and could not do , what resources we had and what we did n’t . 

 In addition , to clarify our customer segments and profile them , we even used different stick figures to   distinguish between the customer traits and used those figures for the whole mapping process . This   specific aspect of using one visual aid e.g. , icon in every meeting we had , made it easier for us to take it   from where we stopped and to form a small culture between us . 

 For our project roadmap , it was all visual . We created it online using a <NAME> chart to show where and   when the milestones will be and showcase whether some of the milestones intersect . 

 Insight 

 Visualizing helped us remember the information we were sharing since it would be there on the board   or the notebook or the online whiteboard we used . We could easily revisit past points and discuss them   in relation to other points since they were all visually related . It was also very helpful to us when we   needed to talk about the processes in a more concrete way , for example , the <NAME> chart helped us   check the feasibility of the dates we set for our milestones . 

 Our teamwork has improved as well . Because when we would create a big board full of visually   interrelated information , it helped us come to a conclusion together with whoever was presenting their   thought process . 

 In short , the efficiency problem I was worried about was eliminated when we decided to apply the   visualization tool to our project . 

 Approach 

 Our project involves setting up a shop that is welcoming and relaxing , and fun at the same time . Our   next step is to decide on how this shop will look in detail and visualizing is the tool that will be crucial to   our success in this next mission .

"LEARNING LAUNCH ( MODULE 4 ) 

 CHALLENGE 

 The challenge I posed to put into practice the knowledge acquired during this course   was : How could I start a business in times of crisis caused by the pandemic ? This was the   challenge question that I asked at the beginning , then I remembered that in my family   We had had a business that had not worked for more than 10 years . This business   consisted of selling lemon cookies characteristic of the town where my family comes   from . As I wanted to start a family business , I thought that returning to this option would   be very profitable , but of course , adding a touch that would make us different from the   rest of the neighborhood bakeries . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 The tool I selected for this occasion was the learning launch , this taking into account the   process that is applied to put this tool into practice ( learned during the course ) ,   considering the process I thought it was closely related to what I wanted to do with the   challenge : in the first instance the idea was had , a target audience was sought ( starting   with the residents of the neighborhood ) , attending to a need but more than a need an   opportunity to improve what already existed in the market and to innovate in products ,   there are bakeries in the neighborhood and none of them sell traditional cookies .   Thinking through the process to do a learning launch was exactly what the business idea   needed to come up . 

 APPLICATION 

 In the first instance , the idea was had , the sale of traditional cookies , then to start doing   the pilot tests , the residents of the neighborhood were taken as the target audience , as   I said before , more than a need found , this business tried to enter the market with a   novel product , but of course not only novel but desired by the target public , since , from   its observation , it was concluded that most of the neighbors were older people , who   preferred traditional products , this represented a great opportunity For us , because this   need was not being satisfied , and of course , the fact of starting to venture with a   different , traditional but novel product ( although it seems paradoxical ) has   differentiated us a lot from the competition . 

 INSIGHT 

 Being honest , I did not believe that this business idea would be succsessful , in fact , I   thought that , due to the global situation due to the pandemic , it would be very difficult   to achieve sales that could collect the initial investment , however , the application of the 

 tools Design thinking not only changed what I thought , but showed it , now our business   has been a success and many people come to get their cookies . 

 APPROACH 

 Now we are thinking of venturing into new products , different from our flagship product   "" Lemon cookies "" , but we also want to launch learning about another target audience ,   perhaps younger , but this time we want to carry out an analysis of what it really is new   market segment asks . 

"
"Challenge 

 In <ADDRESS> , Funeral is several contracts such as church , temple , mosque , transportation , restaurant ,   coffin shop , grave place . Several funerals , for example , Thai , <ADDRESS> , Islamic . I do n’t know the funeral cost   and ca n’t compare price . Reserve place is very struggling . The last parking is very low . 

 Selection 

 I selected visualization tool . So I can think to many possible case and desire of organization , church ,   restaurant , coffin shop , transportation . 

 Application 

 I imagined to the website . It accumulates detail funeral . It has all coffin shop . It can show parking and   car space . It should have a menu to select food and restaurant . It can contract and track transporter .   When I imagined finish . I go to draw everything to paper and connect relation . I write prototype then I   emulate customer use my website and feedback myself . Next , I edit my draw paper , create the   prototype and emulate . When it ok for me so I go to test to the customer . I ask them some question   such as What you no understand ? What it is vague ? What you like and unlike ? Why do you want to use   it ? I summarize benefit of the website and improve it . 

 Insight 

 No perfect but you use what can use . I have thinking process well . I do this and then that . I can see little   thing I never see that problem and how I solve the problem . I see to other sight and other think . 

 Approach 

 I tell other this design thinking must use in your life such as work , learn , buy , sell , run the marathon ,   exercise , love , relationship and other . I teach who interest to this .

"Challenge 

 As a newly appointed corporate communications manager at telco , a   company that provides technology solutions in a country located at the heart of <ADDRESS> named   <ADDRESS> , I was challenged by the fact that this career is new to me although I am pursuing   communication in school . My most challenge was on the use of the company ’s social media   accounts , the ability to engage our customer and to raise awareness about what the company   does and to get feedback from customers to be applied while improving service delivery . 

 Selection 

 Thanks to this “ Design thinking and innovation ” course , I got the opportunity to learn about   Story telling which has help significantly in addressing the challenge I described above .   Specifically referring to a lecture by <NAME> <NAME> , a global and leadership development   director at <ADDRESS> . Inc where he says “ story telling has emotional connection , and it also has   larger purpose . Storytelling is the difference between solving a problem and creating a   cause ” , this gave me an overview on how to handle our customers through communication   on our social media . 

 Application 

 I applied story telling on our social media by sharing emotions and stories that our customers   relate to . Instead of talking our achievements I started to talk about customer experiences   with our product . How It has improved their lives . Instead of posting facts about the   company , I started posting stories from employees who have been in the company for a   while . Slowly , I started to observe an increase in social media users interaction with our   accounts . This created interesting feedbacks on our products that we are now using to   improve our services . 

 Insight 

 Story telling connects to customer more than any other tool when it comes to communication .   Through design thinking it creates a whole circle of interaction that brings more information .   While I thought bragging about the company ’s achievement would increase customers   interest in the company , I have realized when selling   it is not about the company , it not about   you rather it is about the people you intend to sell your services to . 

 Approach 

 Story telling itself is already a vital tool in this situation , however visualization would also   bring more value to the content . Therefore next time I post an information on the company ’s   social media I will insert in a few visuals that will bring us more attention from the   customers .

"Visualization tool for Innovation in Data governance 

 Challenge & selection 

 My challenge consisted in helping one of my customers , a railroad company , to define its data   governance organization for railroad infrastructure knowledge . Railroad activities involve different   roles from different units respectively responsible for sales , circulation , maintenance or projects .   Those units mostly operate apart from each other however their efficiency and the company   efficiency depend on their ability to generate and exchange data at the relevant level of quality . The   current organization only provides poor data quality . Growth of circulation needs , safety issues and   market opening are the challenges that they have to face together that oblige them to ensure a   stronger data governance . 

 Talking about data governance or data ownership in the context of this company was a challenge   because it is really abstract for most of the people involved . That is why I chose visualization tools to   overcome this difficulty . I did use visualization tool first to share the results of a journey mapping   phase , it took the form of user experience graphic pointing out daily good and painful moments   when generating , processing , controlling , publishing or using key railroad infrastructure data . Then I   used visualization tool during a Workshop where participants created a prototype of the future data   governance organization . 

 Application 

 I used journey mapping and “ user experience graphic ” to scope the problem taking into account the   point of view of each unit ( I focused my study on key roles of data generation , control , publishing and   use ) . Journey mapping was the opportunity to deeply understand the expectations of every   stakeholder and to point out the main pain points and their root cause . It took me a month and a half   with the help of a co - coworker to follow the activities of each key role . I shared the results with the   stakeholders and I let them time to discuss , challenge and appropriate the outcomes . 

 Then I set a workshop and selected 12 participants from different units to generate ideas for each   pain point . During the first step of the Workshop , I split the group into 3 groups of 4 people with a   representative of each unit in each group . Each group shared their ideas with everyone . For the   second step , I mixed the group to make another 3 working groups of 4 people and I invited them to   use the generated ideas as building blocks to define the future data governance organization . For   each group the data governance organization took the form of a graphic compliant with the process   notation standard of the company ( BPMN ) . A person of each group shared their view and responded   to questions and remarks of other participants . Finally during the last step , we draw the target   organization by identifying the common denominator of each proposition and completing with ideas   agreed by the whole group . 

 I finally set a meeting to validate with the management the main outcomes and the milestones of a   pilot roll - out . The pilot is currently in progress on a narrow scope , every key role has been   distributed , and the main processes are roughly defined and will be detailed during this   experimentation . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Using journey mapping and user experience graphic allow me to point out the painful moments   experimented by each stakeholder and to identify the main root cause of the data governance   problems which is the various key data definition and different uses across the different railroad   units respectively responsible of sales , circulation , maintenance or projects . The sharing of the   journey mapping outcomes using visualization tools ( user experience graphic ) was also a key success   factor as it was the first step to set a common view overcoming unit specificities . Every stakeholder   realized the operating consequences of poor data quality and their role in the big picture .   Visualization tool was very helpful to create empathy from everyone . 

 <ADDRESS> generated during the workshop were gathered in different themes : new roles , tools ,   organization principles , activities , macro processes . The Workshop was really productive and   performed in a good mood despite former tenseness between units . When we draw the target   organization , I paid attention to everyone and made sure that each participant even the quietest   validated each decision . I learned that silence does not mean agreement . The use of visualization   tools ( Process drawing ) helped me a lot to mitigate vocabulary sterile debate especially when we   started to talk about data “ ownership ” . Visualization tools helped to redefine necessary roles and   associated activities in a very effective timing as the Workshop only took a day . 

 The experimentation is currently in progress . The people involved are enthusiastic and proud and act   as ambassadors to their colleagues . The result is very different from state of the art in data   governance , more simple and understandable for people working in this railroad company .

"Shoptimus Prime : Company General Use 

 Challenge and selection , 

 In my workplace understanding the clients is the toughest part , as sometimes they have a specific idea in   mind , while us designers have another . Using visualization techniques prior to starting the actual task   eliminates the difficulty of trying to understand each other and rather puts us on the same page . By starting   out with a rough sketch and adding some colors and simple designs , this helps the job flow smoother and go   on time . 

 Application 

 Before stating any project , I conduct a meeting with my client to understand exactly what it is they ’re   looking for and I look through the examples I received from them . I then begin searching for some   samples and start to make my first draft and then request another meeting , this is to be sure that I ’m   going on the right track to completing the project . 

 For any project received , I have to decide if the project can be handled by one person or requires more   people in order to finish it efficiently and on time . If it ’s simple job I work on it by myself by conducting   meetings and discussions with client until we come upon an agreement for the end result . If the project   is big and requires a team to work on it the we start brainstorming together to come with a solution   then distribute the work accordingly . 

 Insight & Approach     What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that the sketches and the   note    that I got from the client and from the team is important for reinforcing their understanding of   the problem that we are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared insights   and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem space . The graphic gives   the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to share their   perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they could create   the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump starts the   conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are missing –   and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of taking time   to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps them to identify   what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide the values for   the variables . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would   use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised   graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the   remainder of their work .

 ideas with all the knowledge acquired , for me the storytelling tool is the best alternative to 

 emerge in the field of communication with the client since this tool is used by great leaders 

 of brands and companies that have a great history behind what they are today , a strategy 

 that connects with the emotions , character , values of the people who will use this product , a 

 great tool in the business world . and I consider this to be my best choice . 

 Application 

 The first step in applying this tool was to recognize my audience by using 

 interviews and open - ended questions about their design preferences about my first product 

 called "" Multi Lamp "" . In order to ask good questions , I choosed to listen , study and learn 

 from a brand that is a world leader today , Coca Cola its progress and difficulties , how it 

 became known worldwide , its scopes , its current and future purposes as a brand to create 

 my own story , like why a lamp ? what was my motivation ? 

 My story is inspired by long hours of study my parents lived in a room where a 

 lamp was perhaps the most modern thing they had on hand . My parents say that in their 

 time at university , when they were married at an early age , their only friend was a lamp . 

 For to study , they could not extend their study hours at home because they lived in a small 

 place with my grandparents , they studied long hours at night . This is the story that I want to 

 convey , I want people to value what modernity offers us . 

 For what I offer my clients that same lamp , but renovated with accessories that 

 perhaps they did not think they could include , all in one object with various designs , 

 models , and unlike the first lamp that my parents had , I want to offer continuous 

 improvements , the reliability that my product expresses , all the way traveled and yet to be 

 traveled , the renewed vision that I want to ofert my audience . My biggest challenge is to be 

 able to transmit my story , because this product is so important to me and the benefits to my 

 clients , the scope achieved and my long - term vision , a varied production line ( bedroom 

 accessories ) in no time , being able to position my first product in the main supermarkets of 

 the city , after the country and why not internationally .   my story is my best strategy to 

 access more groups of people , get their attention , without forgetting my group of friends 

 who are within this project , people with vision , friends , their advice , criticism , who are the 

 essence of this project . 

 Insight 

 One of the most optimistic responses I got from my interviewees was the reception 

 capacity I received when I told my story briefly , without bragging , acting simply , showing 

 my wishes with a product designer , the beginning of what could be my development in the 

 professional world . Not every listener reacts in the same way , but this tool has managed to 

 attract the attention of a larger group of people . This tool allowed me to get more attention 

 from the public that already knew me , everyone watches the movement of my hands , my 

 inspiration when telling my project without forgetting the people who support me . In other 

 instances , I would not have chosen to tell my story . 

 Approach 

 Product design has been a part of my university career that I have considered as a 

 future in the workplace , so I would like to expand my knowledge about design , but above 

 all , to be able to reach a certain audience regardless of what product I want to offer , I want 

 to feel the satisfaction of my clients , transfer my ideas as my own to my clients . I will Use 

 this storytelling tool today as a student , but one day I want to be the one to tell a great story 

 starting today .

"​        ​   Reflection -Story telling 

 Challenges and Selection 

 Storytelling is an incredible specialized instrument that empowers us as individuals 

 to see more about our passionate encounters . This makes it a successful technique 

 to use during the plan cycle . It very well may be utilized during the plan thinking 

 measure stages with an alternate objective in each stage . Narrating is an incredible 

 device that I utilize constantly . 

 The plan thinking measure guarantees the client involvement in each phase to 

 manufacture a client focused arrangement . Subsequently , the narrating is utilized all 

 through the plan cycle , yet there is an alternate utilization objective in each stage . By 

 and large , the narrating can be utilized as three sets stages ; issue confining , 

 arrangement surrounding , and arrangement execution . 

 Applications 

 Narrating is one of the old fine arts of correspondence . <NAME> <NAME> is 

 one of the most recent administration patterns , and there has been an expanded 

 ascent in narrating research just as interview . The use of narrating fits the 

 investigation of the most recent examination here . There has been countless 

 investigations recording authoritative stories just as vouching about the adequacy of 

 narrating . 

 Studies in hierarchical stories go back to the mid 1980s . Resulting audits have 

 attempted to investigate or arrange authoritative stories . This paper zeroed in 

 additional on the utilization of stories in associations from a viable perspective . The 

 target of the paper was to comprehend the current utilization of stories in the work 

 environment and prescribe its utilization as per Indian work settings . This paper 

 endeavored to survey the most recent exploration on authoritative narrating with 

 recommendations to its application in Indian associations 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 Significant progress to integrate and analyse multimodal data has been carried out in 

 the last years . Yet , little research has tackled the challenge of visualising and 

 supporting the sensemaking of multimodal data to inform teaching and learning . It is 

 naïve to expect that simply by rendering multiple data streams visually , a teacher or 

 learner will be able to make sense of them . This paper introduces an approach to 

 unravel the complexity of multimodal data by organising it into meaningful layers that 

 explain critical insights to teachers and students . 

 The approach is illustrated through the design of two data storytelling prototypes in 

 the context of nursing simulation . Two authentic studies with educators and students 

 identified the potential of the approach to create learning analytics interfaces that 

 communicate insights on team performance , as well as concerns in terms of 

 accountability and automated insights discovery .

"CHALLENGE AND SELECTION : 

 The challenge which I came across is that we come across a lot of people who do have mental health   issues but do not tend to take the treatment or are unable to do so from the renowned   professionals . But it is equally important to give importance to both physical and mental health   which is lacking in the society . For this , I would like to use the tool of <NAME> which can help one   to display out all the attributes of a product . To highlight the unexpected results and generate new   perspectives ; draw the conclusion and summarize the key findings . Also identify the relevant factors   of influence that constitute the basis for a new or improved product and analyse it in a targeted   manner . 

 APPLICATION : 

 We see a lot of people having mental health issues but do not tend to take treatment from   professionals . This is because of in - office treatment stigma , lack of awareness and availability . But it   is important to give equal importance to both physical and mental health which is lacking in the   society . So , I came up with an idea of mental health app with professionals like psychologists ,   psychotherapists , counsellors . Along with professionals we also include caregivers because they play   an important role in the treatment process . The app also includes personality tests , mood trackers ,   positive quotes and many more features . Through the app we can reach out to large group of people   with 24/7 availability at their comfort level . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH : 

 It can help the users to connect with mental health professionals through an online platform and   engage in therapy sessions and activities like personality tests , mood trackers , and other additional   features . Through the app we can reach out to large group of people . By including activities to boost   the spirit of the users like mood trackers , personality tests , in - app rewards to increase motivation   and providing help to the caregivers through this platform , the users can get additional benefits . It is   important to give mental health equal importance with physical health and make the treatment   available to everyone .

"In - Store Merchandising Placement – Learning Launch 

 Challenge   I work in a Consumer Electronics company that manufactures and sells <ADDRESS> equipment   ( such as speakers , headphones , earphones , etc ) . The company sells its products via   different consumer electronics stores , all around the world ( e.g. <NAME> in the US , Fnac   in <ADDRESS> , MediaMarkt in <ADDRESS> , etc ) .   We have been designing our latest Visual   Merchandising elements for the stores , i.e. the way we will be displaying our products in   those stores . That includes the furniture , the placement , the signage , the demonstrations ,   etc . Our challenge was to identify the best solution from the many available , within a   given budget limit , to make the best business impact ( i.e. maximum sales ) . The solution   would be deployed in more than 1000 stores globally and thus it needed to be well   thought and with minimal risk , as after deployment changes would not be easy at this   large scale . 

 Selection   We have been internally working with agile methodology in different parts of the   organization and in this case we decided to use the   learning launch tool . We wanted to   create a control learning launch as an experiment to quickly test the ideas and prototypes ,   before rolling solutions out the market widely . 

 Application   We decided to use 6 stores as trial locations ( 2 in US , 2 in <ADDRESS> , 2 in <ADDRESS> ) . And   we created 2 different visual merchandising concepts that we then trialed in each of those   stores ( i.e. each concept was tried in 3 stores , all in different countries ) . One of the   concepts was more visual ( i.e. large imagery next to the products ) , with photos of how the   products are used ( e.g. in a living room environment , or while traveling ) . The other   concept was more focused on the product specifics ( e.g. materials used , technical   specifications , etc ) . The prototypes had sensors so we could collect data on how many   people reached the display , how many people tried / demo the products , and of course how   many people made a purchase . We run this trial for 2 months , to collect sufficient data . 

 Insight   Apart from the quantitative data , we also collected data by observation ( i.e. looking what   people were doing in the store ) but also talking to the sales personnel about their   observations . We learned that talking more about the lifestyle and context of the product ,   i.e. how it is used and how it adds value to the customer at home or traveling , was   definitely much more inspiring and intriguing for the customers to approach and interact   with the product displays ( vs. the technical specification alternative approach ) . We are   now in the phase of rolling out the concept globally . 

 <NAME>   While the learning launch tool gave us strong insight on the correct concept to use , next   time we should like to take it into more “ steps ” , in a more iterative approach . While we   answered the top level question , we also have some other smaller questions unanswered .   Next time we would like to make a similar setup with 6 stores , but before launching try a   more refined concept to e.g. 10 - 12 stores , for nailing down more details , before going   global .

"Student Name : <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> : Story Telling 

 Challenge Description : 

 As the leader of a coordination team of 5 persons which has been recently demotivated and   demoralised by dramatic staff reductions in the office which affected several of their   colleagues / friends . I needed to find a way to address managing change with my team   members . Several team members were re - evaluating in a very negative way whether they   too could be affected at any time by change . The attitude of some team members became   that of putting in only the minimum effort for tasks which required excellence and a general   lethargic attitude which did not demonstrate focus and greatly affected productivity . I   recognised an urgent need to re - inspire the team to not only secure their commitment to a   range of upcoming joint actions which would require high energy and beyond the call of   duty time commitments , but also to reinforce to the team that managing change in their   professional and personal lives are important for success as development professionals and   as human beings . I needed a powerful tool that would put the human nature of my team   front   and   centre .   This   video   helped   me   to   present   my   story   well : 

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-hdQMa3uA 

 I choose <NAME> <NAME> as the tool to explain to the team that change and transformation are   constants in life which we should be open to exploring and adjusting to over time . I decided   to make an emotional investment in my team and shared the story of my own family   overcoming challenges and innovating to overcome poverty as an example of why their   contribution to development work is important and the impact it can potentially have on   those who need it most . 

 Selection : I selected the tool of storytelling as a tool to ignite passion , unite the team   around common goals and connect emotionally with my team by assuring them that our   values were not different in the changing situation , our perspectives may just have been   influenced by their experience with constant stability in their case and frequent   adjustments / instabilities in my own life experiences . I choose this tool to explain that I had   also found some of the changes demoralising , however , the realities of the organizations   financial constraints necessitated them . I assured the team that as a team leader , I was not   disconnected from the events which affected them , however , since I had encourtered   change and the need to transform very often in my own life , to keep focussed to succeed ,   my lens on seeing the change needed to be slightly different . I used the tool since it allowed   me to use reflection on how what seems like a negative set of events can sometime provide   opportunities for replenishing the organization with new skill sets needed as country and   organization priorities change . I reassured the team that each of their experiences , skills and   knowledge were indispensable to the success and impact of our joint work . 

 Application : I applied the tool by using my reflection as an emotional connector .    Used the   story telling approach to show how everyone ’s inputs and how coordinated interventions   such as scholarships for advanced study from one development agency helped my older   sister and I to obtain multiple masters degrees , business grants to poor families from   another agency and mentors from the private sector paved the way for several of my family   members to establish what are now thriving indigenous / creative businesses . To explain how   unplanned Change can be , I have shared how the unexpected / unplanned event such as the   death of a mother did not derail the lives of 7 children she left behind , because their father   focused simultaneously on investing in education , business , connected them to successful   mentors and in essence had a multi - dimensional approach to building resilient lives for his   children . In the same way , I have explained the planned changes in the office were needed ,   the commitment required from each UN staff member to give of his / her best every day to   make an impact for those most vulnerable should always come first . I used explanation of   multiple challenges in my personal story to explain the complex dimensions of our work as a   team and why every hand on deck was necessary for the new ways we would work in . I used   the example of business innovation using indigenous materials as a case for how to innovate   for the complex times ahead for our unit , even on a limited budget . I used the story telling   to show how with out of the box thinking and willingness to face change and have an   impact , it is possible to find solutions to difficult development challenges . In building   suspense about the challenges of my family experience , I told the stories of dramatic exam   fees due and my father receiving his salary on the same date as the due date and avoiding   the calamity of not being able to make payment on time . I spark innovation for our team   processes I also reflected on my sister using my grandmother ’s recipe to start a successful   milk shake business . 

 Insight Description : By challenging myself to tell a story which connected me to the team ,   allowed me to first connect with my own emotions about change , to reflect on my   perspectives on my own experiences and how with strategy and with being open to new   opportunities created sometimes by negative events , one can change the course of a   business , an institution / organization and of lives . In telling my story , several team members   opened - up about their own stories and how it affected their inability to adjust quickly to   change . From those personal stories , I was able to identify creative new skills which could be   harnessed for team innovation in the office and I gained a better understanding of why my   colleagues responded they way they did to what some thought was a disaster . Sharing of   perspectives allowed us to all explore our roles in the team going forward and to identify   the new skills , partnerships and training needed to adjust and to excel in a changing   environment . It strengthened the team work tremendously . 

 Approach : I would use the same tool of storytelling because it is compelling and it allowed   me to get the team to pay attention . I think my colleagues were looking to be inspired and   the story engaged them . I gave the team some data , I located the most powerful part of my   story which was managing and surviving and thriving through unplanned changes time and 

 time again . I shared strategies for addressing complexity by sharing a related story that gave   my approach life and made the need for pulling together in difficult times understandable .

"Challenge   I was working on a project of Designing and Manufacturing a Solar Electric Vehicle . We were a team of 30 students and   our primary aim for this project was for the greener environment and participating in National Competitions was the   secondary . We had built electric cars for 2 consecutive years and this time the project was about designing and   manufacturing Electric Bike . Here , the plan was to make a proper structure and proceed as per it to ensure that errors are   omitted . Previously , all our team members had contributed to every single expenditure starting from manufacturing to   traveling at the competition location . So , our challenge was to gain funding from external sources and yes , we used one of   the tools mentioned in the course . 

 Selection   As per the challenge mentioned above , we decided to get funding from external sources like our own Institute , Organizations   that have the same aim as ours and crowdfunding as a very last option . So , we organized an event and invited all the guests   of respective organizations and used the Storytelling Tool as our process of the program . 

 Application   Using the storytelling approach , I shared a true and inspiring story about an incident in the past .    Our club was formed 3 years back . The very first year it was difficult and challenging for us to learn and adapt all things   involved in the project . Somehow managing the deadline , we built a 4 - wheeled single - seater car . We reached the location   continued the work and participated in the competitions . First - round included the inspection of all the parameters of the   vehicle . A maximum of four attempts was allowed for this event and clearing this only would eligible for all the next rounds .   After attempting all the four times , we were unable to clear and got disqualified from the event . Taking that disappointment   and all the difficulties we packed everything and headed towards the location of the next competition which was scheduled   2 days after the first competition . We reached there and started the modification and repair work of our vehicle . Here too   the first round was about the Technical Inspection . After all the changes and safety checks we managed to clear the round   at this competition . Now , we were eligible for all the next rounds . We cleared the next round too of breaking dynamic tests .   The acceleration test was the next round and we were reaching the spot for this round . Suddenly while driving the vehicle   to the spot , burning smell and smoke was seen near the driver ’s compartment . The driver somehow managed to get out of   the vehicle . The smoke turned into vigorous fire and within no time the whole vehicle caught the fire . No fire extinguisher   or water buckets did not work . All left was the metal parts of the vehicle .   The very next moment we decided to build a vehicle with all proper structure and would not only participate but also   compete with other participants in these two events . After two months after the incident , we formed a new team with new   energy and enthusiasm . With a proper flow and structure , we worked for around e months . Again , at the same time of the   year , we headed for our competition . We reached there and made some of the minor modifications and went for the technical   inspection round . After rigorous testing and checks for 4 hours , our team was the first to clear the Technical Inspection   round . Then , we participated in all events and ended ranking first in the two major events and the top five for the rest of the   events . In the end , we were the Runners Up of the very same competition where we got disqualified the last year . Same as   the previous year , we headed for our next competition . Clearing all the rounds and tests , we ranked first in the four events   and the top three for the rest of the events . At last , we were the Winner of the same competition where our vehicle got burnt   the last year . 

 Insights   The story was very powerful and team ’s effort was appreciated by the whole crowd . People from different organization   spoke a few words in appreciation for the team and also motivating the team for future endeavors . After the session , we   were approached by a few companies and organizations for the funding and the project received full funding of around   � 2,200,00 ( approximately $ 30,000 ) . This was a very useful tool and help us connecting the audience with a real story . 

 Approach   This approach was very effective and to the point for us . This time it was just a normal session and I thought it can be more   interactive and visualizing session . So , I would try with some digital content so that the audience can connect easily with   the story . Also , I would try techniques from the rest of the three tools to explore what and how I can be more effective on   my point . I thank all my peers who are learning with me and who have graded me for this assessment . Last but not least , I   thank University of Virginia and <NAME> <NAME> for such a wonderful course .

"Design Tool – Mind mapping 

 Challenge and Selection 

 The design thinking tool that I would like to use is mind mapping . Mind mapping provides a 

 diagrammatic representation of the ideas . It will help arrange ideas logically as well . I would like 

 to use this tool to bring out interesting ways to handle classes for post graduate students , especially 

 MBA students . The normal lecture sessions have long been found to be ineffective . What is 

 required is practical orientation . Along with incorporating this aspect , the sessions must be 

 designed to be interesting , engaging and effective . But , I am yet to give shape to the idea . This is 

 just the preliminary stage of the idea generation . But I would like to concentrate in this area and 

 bring in a creative solution to make sessions more engaging and interesting . For executing this 

 design thinking plan , I feel mind mapping will be the best suited . The main challenge I feel would 

 be to make all fellow teachers aware of the purpose and to ensure that all of them understands the 

 issue in the same intensity . Only then , good and creative ideas can be elicited . Also , many of them 

 might be hesitant as they might believe that they are already using engaging methods and also may 

 not want to share it . So , to overcome this , it ’s important to bring all of them together in the same 

 track . Mind mapping tool helps to provide a visual representation of the various ideas .   A mind 

 map is a figure or a diagram used to visually represent and organize information . In this scenario , 

 mind mapping tool may aid in achieving the best possible solution . 

 Application 

 I plan to use the mind mapping tool to bring in creative solutions to the problem mentioned above . 

 For this , faculty members from various institutions ( UG and PG ) must be selected . Those who 

 strongly feel the need to revamp the pedagogy must be selected for the process . After briefing 

 them on the exact purpose of doing this , they will be asked to create a mind map , by placing the 

 main idea at the center and creative ideas as its branches . It literally ' maps ' out the thoughts , using 

 associations , connections , and triggers to stimulate further ideas . Once , all the participants have 

 completed , all the mind maps will be displayed and the forum can be put for discussion . In the 

 course of discussion , the best solutions and creative ideas will be picked and decisions on how to 

 implement them can be taken . 

 At the same time , students can also be asked to prepare a mind map to bring in creative solutions 

 to the problems that they face and to convert the sessions into engaging ones . This helps to know 

 the exact demands of the customers ( students ) , and will provide a base on which solutions can be 

 applied . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 As I have not undertaken the activity , it ’s difficult to give the practical insights . Due to the 

 pandemic situation , the plan could n’t be executed . But , I feel that it will help all faculty members 

 to get an insight into how effective the current pedagogy is and better methods to follow . 

 The next time , I would like to do something related to including basic life skills and value 

 education in school syllabus . Basically , to bring a practical orientation . For this , the learning 

 launch method would be useful . It will be essential to create a plan and to do a trial run to find out 

 if it is effective or not .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge and Selection 

 As a Consultant for Learning , I deal mostly with mass changes and further implementation of   software , ways of working , new training needs , among other things . When working with the “ big ”   Clients , the expression “ one - size - fits - all ” needs to be put aside , because there are people from all   over the world with different backgrounds , different knowledge scopes , totally different levels of   computer - savviness and motivations . 

 The selection of Storytelling for one of my eLearning projects came from the need of a more   appealing and compelling training for the new software being implemented in this <ADDRESS> ’s company   as It makes it relatable , It gives strategy color , and life in character and plot . Why did I choose   Storytelling as the tool to develop it ? It was mainly due to the fact that after all the training - needs- analysis phase of the project was completed , the central verdict was that the inequalities among the   workers were too hefty which made us decide to create more than one eLearning for the same topic   in order to keep everyone engaged , taking into consideration the different needs and motivations . 

 Application 

 It was settled that for the Customer Care team I would use Storytelling eLearning by creating the   stories of personas ( characters ) and their daily lives . This would make the workers feel relatable and   less prompt to get bored by the content . 

 For the purpose , we gathered the results of their interviews and tests , and created the profile of 5   virtual personas to use in the course . For each and every character I have designed a different   routine and role to play in the course . What all these characters had in common was the fact that   they were Customer Care workers and we used the picture of some headphones and desk as a prop   to indicate this . 

 So , the content of the eLearning was pretty heavy and complex , it had to do with a new software   being implemented in the whole company and the workers ought to learn how to use it in record   speed time . I ’ve described the life of these workers from the moment that they would leave their   houses to head to work until the moment they would leave the office to go home . I have based the   content of the Storytelling eLearning on the different backgrounds and cultural specifications   reflected on their interviews and made it as interactive as possible , describing persona - journeys . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 What initially seemed to be a simple task – preparing an eLearning that teaches the workers how to   use a software – turned out to be a much more complex one in which <NAME> tool played a   pivotal role to engage and motivate . 

 The workers of this department said that they even entered the course more than once and never   had so much fun in completing an eLearning . All in all , they are now fully aware of how to use the   new software and <NAME> allowed not only for them to feel relatable to something while   learning , but also for the Company in general to experience a much smoother mass transition . 

 What would I do different next time ? Maybe using <NAME> <NAME> for all the departments   instead of just this one . Customer Care department felt engaged and involved in the process from   the very beginning and the results reflected it , they passed the quiz at first , they entered the course 

 more than once and speedily learned how to use the software and return to the course every time a   question would arise . There were some departments in which the result was quite different , and the   users are still struggling with this software change , not willing to take the eLearning once again . Why   is that ? Because I assumed that they were more computer - savvy who would n’t need a persona- based eLearning to feel engaged . I was wrong . Next time I am facing a mass implementation as this   one I will most probably create a <NAME> <NAME> for all the departments , only diversifying the   personas ( characters ) included and their journeys , to fulfill each department need .

"REFLECTION – VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge selection 

 Visualization is the tool I have been using the last year to achieve a share under- 

 standing with some of my clients . 

 I work in a representative office of a Spanish law firm in <ADDRESS> as a Spanish 

 tax lawyer . Although in <ADDRESS> I advise on many Spanish tax related issues my 

 expertise is international taxation on intangible assets cross border transactions . 

 One of the first things I realized when I started this professional adventure was 

 that the players involved in my daily work life changed . In <ADDRESS> , I used to work 

 together with in - house lawyers but in <ADDRESS> I work with the engineers who cre- 

 ate / develop / use the intangibles . 

 After a couple of meetings I became aware of the following reality : lawyers have 

 our own way of thinking and talking , and no one understand us . Therefore , I 

 started using visualization to communicate with the engineers . 

 Symbols , colors and numbers in PPTs and blackboards are , nowadays , my best 

 allies to communicate with some of my clients . 

 Application 

 I usually start the process by understanding the intangible asset and so no one 

 better than the engineers can help me . This approach usually involves a guided 

 visit to my client´s labs and/or production plants and meetings with the engineers . 

 When these meetings take place , I ask them to explain the intangible as well as 

 its development process with three objectives : ( i ) start using visualization – they 

 need to be creative and patient to explain an intangible asset without using a non- 

 technical approach ; ( ii ) loose the fear to ask – since I ask many questions that are 

 evident for them but not for me they do not feel fear to later ask me about taxation ; 

 and ( iii ) show up that lawyers and engineers talk a different language and , as a 

 consequence , we need a language we both understand . 

 Before drafting any contract or endless memorandum , I prepare a PPT with sym- 

 bols , colors and numbers showing what I understood about the intangible and the 

 main tax issues connected with the transaction . The main purpose of the PPT is 

 to explain international taxation in a way that it can be easily understood by an 

 engineer so the team understand what I need from their side and we can work 

 together in the “ design ” of a structure or a strategy . After the PPT delivery , we 

 sometimes meet and discuss not only taking into account the intangible but also 

 its taxation . 

 Insight & approach 

 What I have learned by using this tool is that work is much easier when all players 

 understand all the issues involved and that the “ visualization effort ” is well re- 

 ceived by all the players . Engineers are more proactive and are happy to further 

 explain the intangible or its creation process because they understand the reasons 

 why this information is key for tax purposes . 

 Since I discovered that a common language help to share insights , I am working 

 on presentations and guides that show legal and tax concepts in a non - technical 

 way because not all our clients are lawyers and our services should be more cus- 

 tomer focus . My idea is not only provide them with these presentations and guides 

 but also have a training session in which the Q&A would be the main element .

"Design thinking for innovation                           <NAME> assignment                                  MIND MAPPING                                                                              <NAME> 

 Mind mapping is used to represent how ideas or other items are linked to a central   idea and to each other . Mind maps are used to generate , visualize , structure , and   classify ideas to look for patterns and insights that provide key design criteria . 

 Challenge : 

 I was one of the process group   analysts in the team of a total 6 people in the project . The   project was part of a software development and artificial intelligence   programme of a   public authority . There was a limited time of effort to be paid . In few months we   had to   deliver a working data or the process data   to be used by all the authority departments . The   project we   were responsible for was the document management system of the authority .   The knowledge of the domain was not prepared and made properly and unfortunately a   couple of my same group   department employees or followers    were holding this   knowledge in their minds . So the analysis part of the modules the software   was really hard   to define from an analyst 's perspective as their internal stakeholders or investors and   company members . 

 Selection : 

 Mind mapping makes it easier to learn faster , brainstorm faster , and communicate more   effectively . These are all very nullified   skills to have in the todays business   world : being   able to do all of the above more efficiently saves you time and improves the quality of your   work and also gives us best results choosing this method is suitable for overcoming my   challenge and also   and enhances creative problem solving . 

 Application : 

 first I   Identified   the central idea and add it to your mind map . Maybe you 've been   told to develop requirements for a new system and   Identify the main areas that   impact the problem . So I have various ways of using mind   mapping   in my challenge   so I have selected mind mapping   There ’s no real rules to using mind maps . And You just   enter your central idea , maybe it ’s a requirement or a problem , and then start adding   everything that comes to mind .   Mind maps are excellent in interviews and workshops , or as   a personal thinking tool . 

 Insight : 

 •   It helps you remember and recall information , Try this little experiment and It   helps you learn new concepts 

 •   It 's a fun way of learning and   It makes complex ideas easier to understand 

 •   It improves your presenting and It boosts your creativity   and its gives us the    improves productivity and   flexible . 

 Approach : 

 Next I might use the visualization as , it gives much more creativity and Visualization   or visualisation is any technique for creating images , diagrams , or animations to communicate a   message . Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both   abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity .

"Reflection- Storytelling 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Storytelling , visualization , and mind mapping were some of the tools I   equipped myself with after the completion of this course in <NAME> . I am a   junior researcher in my Laboratory . Diabetic assay is one of the important   research works undertaken in our lab and I am a part of a group of researchers   that head this research . The work that we are pursuing has a great novelty and   a big purpose provided that our research is successful . This course , especially   the storytelling tool helped me put things in perspective and explain to my   fellow researchers and my head about the direction our project could take to   fulfil that cause , and storytelling was a great tool to explain and hopefully   convince them to pursue it . 

 Application 

 ‘ Design thinking ’ course provided me with a framework to structure my story .   My fellow researchers were finding our challenge too big to overcome but I   figured out that if I can tell a story that will aid them in converting our   challenge to a cause , I was sure I can get them on board . I wanted them to feel   involved and present them with all the possibilities that our research work had .   In my next research meeting , I gave a presentation where I told a story . <ADDRESS> is   a country with a population of over 1 billion of which 88 million people are   below the poverty line . They are always neglected when it comes to   healthcare , especially diabetes 2 . It is a sad situation and our research has the   potential to figure out a diabetic assessment kit that way cheaper than the   ones available in our market currently and could be easily accessible to all the   villages in the country . I told them the story of ‘ Raji ’ . A single mom in a village   called <ADDRESS> , south of <ADDRESS> . She had diabetes 2 , but being a daily wage   worker who had to provide for her children , she decided not to get her   treatment . I told them of her struggles daily and clearly explained to them the   challenges she has to face regularly . This was a story that had a lot of emotions   but it also had logic attached to it .   She was just an example in a country of   over 100 million whose healthcare is neglected . This story had a larger   purpose . So , I felt it was the right story to tell my group to convince them to   take a different approach in our project to serve <NAME> and millions more like   her . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 My whole team was moved by this story . My fellow researchers came from   different parts of <ADDRESS> , mostly rural areas where healthcare was costly , so they   could all relate to the story and felt that they have the resources to find a   solution if a proper work plan is charted . Our senior research scholar was   convinced with our new approach and now our team is working on a new   cheap ‘ saliva - based diabetic test kit ’ which if successful could save many   people . And I truly believe that if not for my story , it would have been   impossible to convince my team . In a research - based environment , our   meetings were always data - driven but for a change , bringing the human aspect   of our research into the meetings brought a big change and I am sure that I will   continue to present my research talks with a human approach and continue to   remind my colleagues of the great work we are doing and I ’m thankful to my   friend for suggesting me to take up this course .

"Reflection – Mind mapping 

 The challenge 

 I am working on marketing agency , and we start new Facebook page to promote our product , and we   tried so hard   to increase the engagement in our posts , in order to increase sales ,   the challenge is to   Increase the engagement by editing the posts style and content in a way that attract people and drive   them to engage with our products , as the problem is human - centered , because we need to understand   our market behavior , attitude , culture and traditions . we need more data to understand our product   value to the new market , as we have some data , we need to start doing research 

 The selection 

 I chose to use mind mapping tool , so I can look for pattern and   themes I have in my data , furthermore   , I will collect data from different competitors , so I need to know what is the common thing they are   using and how they enter that market and how they acquire   new customers 

 The application 

 After collecting a large quantity of data I will use the mind mapping tool to establish criteria for what if   idea generation phase , and to capture and represents the minds of our customers , 

 First , I will do my research then identify my criteria then establishing a design criteria 

 I will start researching my competitors , to see what kind of price strategy they are using , how they   attract people to their website , what is their competitive advantage … .etc . ,   then I will develop my   criteria and what I have found and last I will establish my criteria for the next phase . 

 Insight 

 After applying the mind mapping tool I established my criteria which they are , use low penetration   pricing strategy , use informal language in our posts , create high quality design posts , up to date with   trends , create attract color post , and making the information as simple as I can , 

 In this way I think sales and engagement will increase within one month . 

 Approach 

 Mind mapping is one of the strongest   creative thinking tool , I will start using it in different way not only   to find a pattern and themes in my data but also to organize my thought to make a new decision ,   moreover I can apply the storytelling to in order to attract people to my ads , cause as a human being   we love to hear a story until the end

 I 	   am 	   familiar 	   with 	   some 	   of 	   the 	   tools 	   in 	   the 	   course 	   since 	   I 	   use 	   similar 	   ones 	   while 	    collecting 	   data 	   ( peoples 	   interviews ) 	   for 	   social 	   research . 	   The 	   learning 	   launch 	   is 	   a 	    bit 	   of 	   a 	   new 	   way 	   for 	   me 	   to 	   approach 	   solutions , 	   so 	   I 	   decided 	   to 	   test 	   it . 	   Only , 	   in 	   this 	    case 	   the 	   prototype 	   is 	   not 	   a 	   material 	   one 	   but 	   an 	   activity . 

 Application 

 I 	   first 	   thought 	   that 	   attention 	   is 	   what 	   the 	   older 	   boy 	   needed . 	   So , 	   I 	   arranged 	   the 	    routing 	   in 	   a 	   way 	   that 	   I 	   will 	   allocate 	   more 	   one 	   to 	   one 	   time 	   to 	   the 	   7 	   year 	   old 	   and 	    eliminate 	   the 	   fighting 	   due 	   to 	   jealousy , 	   thinking 	   that 	   I 	   will 	   gain 	   time 	   and 	    cooperation 	   from 	   the 	   7 	   year 	   old 	   to 	   get 	   dress 	   alone . 	  	   However , 	   this 	   quick 	   test 	    proves 	   it 	   wrong . 	   After 	   trying 	   it 	   for 	   two 	   days , 	   I 	   only 	   got 	   more 	   nagging 	   and 	   need 	    for 	   more 	   attention . 	   The 	   result 	   was 	   a 	   bit 	   catastrophic . 	   I 	   got 	   the 	   opposite 	   result . 

 What 	   if 	   I 	   make 	   it 	   a 	   game 	   to 	   get 	   dressed ? 	   Since 	   the 	   7 	   year 	   old 	   likes 	   to 	   win , 	   why 	   not 	    design 	   a 	   game 	   that 	   the 	   result 	   will 	   be 	   only 	   to 	   win . 	   So , 	   on 	   the 	   third 	   morning 	   I 	   said 	    to 	   him , 	   here 	   are 	   your 	   clothes 	   and 	   there 	   are 	   your 	   little 	   brother ’s 	   clothes . 	   Let 	   see 	    who 	   get 	   dressed 	   first ? 	   And 	   I 	   set 	   a 	   timer . 	   The 	   7 	   year 	   old 	   got 	   dressed 	   in 	   5 	   minutes 	    and 	   was 	   happy 	   and 	   ready 	   to 	   go 	   to 	   school 	   with 	   a 	   great 	   mood . 	   The 	   following 	    morning 	   that 	   routing 	   worked 	   great , 	   I 	   did 	   not 	   need 	   to 	   direct 	   much 	   the 	   kids , 	   and 	    day 	   by 	   day 	   the 	   competition 	   of 	   getting 	   dressed 	   moved 	   from 	   winning 	   the 	   brother 	    to 	   achieving 	   the 	   best 	   time . 	   And 	   as 	   a 	   plus , 	   the 	   little 	   brother 	   started 	   to 	   compete 	   too 	    by 	   trying 	   to 	   get 	   dressed 	   alone . 

 Insight 	   and 	   Approach 

 What 	   a 	   surprise 	   was 	   the 	   learning 	   launch . 	   Attention 	   was 	   not 	   what 	   the 	   7 	   year 	   old 	    needed , 	   although 	   it 	   was 	   the 	   logical 	   solution 	   to 	   a 	   clear 	   problem . 	   Jealousy 	   and 	    attention 	   was 	   like 	   the 	   symptom 	   of 	   an 	   illness , 	   but 	   the 	   real 	   problem 	   was 	   hidden . 	   As 	    it 	   was 	   said 	   in 	   the 	   course , 	   the 	   studied 	   people 	   not 	   always 	   know 	   what 	   their 	   need , 	    and 	   it 	   is 	   our 	   job 	   to 	   dig 	   in 	   and 	   find 	   it . 	   The 	   learning 	   launch 	   thought 	   me 	   that 	   the 	   7 	    years 	   old 	   was 	   bored 	   in 	   the 	   mornings , 	   and 	   the 	   nagging 	   for 	   attention 	   was 	   only 	   an 	    act 	   to 	   play 	   with 	   me 	   and 	   make 	   the 	   routine 	   a 	   bit 	   more 	   interesting , 	   for 	   him . 

 These 	   ideas 	   of 	   a 	   small 	   quick 	   test 	   is 	   great 	   because 	   allowed 	   me 	   to 	   tackle 	   only 	   one 	    moment / idea 	   and 	   see 	   that 	   I 	   have 	   choose 	   the 	   wrong 	   idea 	   at 	   the 	   moment 	   of 	    analyzing 	   the 	   problem . 	   Only 	   by 	   changing 	   one 	   moment 	   in 	   the 	   routing 	   I 	   got 	    reactions 	   ( bad 	   / 	   good ) . 	   And 	   the 	   results 	   of 	   the 	   learning 	   launch 	   brought 	   me 	   to 	   the 	    initial 	   state 	   of 	   what 	   is 	   and 	   what 	   if . 	   The 	   initial 	   negative 	   result 	   obtained , 	   pushed 	   me 	    analyze 	   more 	   carefully 	   about 	   what 	   my 	   7 	   year 	   old 	   wants 	   and 	   enjoys 	   to 	   use 	   it 	   as 	   an 	    incentive . 	   The 	   visualization 	   is 	   a 	   key 	   tool 	   that 	   guides 	   the 	   result 	   of 	   the 	   learning 	    launch . 	   It 	   is 	   great 	   to 	   be 	   able 	   to 	   go 	   back 	   and 	   rethink 	   the 	   problem .

"Challenge 

 I am currently part of a startup that is participating in a national prospective startup competition and working with my team members to continuously develop our business model . Our startup focused on creating a children ’s product . The motivation behind this was that an important population of customers that never die out are parents . Many parents are always on the search to find something beneficial for their child , such as nutritious foods and books . Our team knew that the most important factor was that any children 's product had to be compelling for guardians to purchase for any chance of success . As a result , in order to create such a product , our team knew the first step was to understand our target market : the parents . 

 Selection 

 Our team resorted to storytelling as an important tool for our business , as our product was to address the concerns that parents faced with their children . Storytelling is a tool that gives personal insight into one ’s life , and the overlaps in a population ’s individual lives is a common source of inspiration for the invention of a solution . Parents , in particular , have many worries and topics to discuss regarding their children . They are eager to try out solutions if they find it persuasive enough to try . Using the tool of storytelling from our target market , our team hoped to identify an overlapping issue that many parents share and to inspire the development phase of our product . 

 Application 

 First , our team started with the basic step of researching previous information already shared on the internet . This included important stages children go through and skills that children develop during these stages . Most importantly , the research revolved around the common concerns or problems that parents face so our team could understand a general grasp of their shared / individual stories . As a result , our team narrowed our focus on the creativity skills children develop , specifically doodling , and then began a more hands - on utilization of the storytelling tool through surveys with parents . We collected a total of over 50 + survey responses in a few days and were able to gain our own data on the stories and insights parents had with the concerns we asked them about . 

 Insight 

 Interestingly , the data did not align with our initial expectations of having large interest in the issues our potential product would address . Many parents commented that issues of their children doodling did not apply to their lives and did not find such products compelling to purchase . Despite this , the stories of the parents were an opportunity to learn their actual opinions on the matters our team identified . Through this moment of trial and error , this suggested to our team that our approach of narrowing down concerns to one topic of doodling was a poor route . It limited our perception to one topic , while it would have been better to set a 

 general topic for parents and give them the role of narrowing their concerns down through storytelling . Simply put , a more broad start was needed for an effective design thinking process . 

 Approach 

 Despite this result of using the storytelling tool , this motivated our team to continue to use it . The fact that this tool yielded informative results was proof that it was effective and helpful to our developing business . Our team is continuing to use this tool through one on one interviews with parents to have a more in depth understanding of their concerns and opinions on our startup ’s direction for our product through their own stories . This course made me view our target market ’s results in a new light , as before , I would have viewed the many unaligning responses as discouraging and see our business model as hopeless . However , the existence of many other tools and ability to reuse tools in a more effective way inspires our team to look for new approaches to grow our business model .

"Challenge : Actually being the elder son of the family and belonging to middle class , my father was not in   a position to help me continue my higher education in regular mode . Transform myself from a Lab- Assistant to School Principal . 

 Selection : The confidence build by my teachers at school and observation of the surroundings , I learnt   to unlearn that life is a tough one to travel . I explored all that I could and was actually very active and   simply taking and making note of all that I faced and categorized each event under the heading LEARN   and UNLEARN . 

 The more I did was to learn the do nt ’s as they are less in number and results are reflected immediately .   For example an act gifting someone on his birthday or wedding day at the way of reacting to the gift   received we could , to some extent understand the acceptance of the gift by that person . 

 I joined the distance education and could experience the lethargic and irresponsible way of mentors   attending classes and compelling attendance , demanding fine , just running through the lessons or units ,   burdening the students with assignment and project and when submitted , it was not evaluated and the   pathetic thing is at times the mentors themselves had no idea on the topic and project . 

 I decided to learn on my own , then I could see that actually thing are n’t what they appear and how they   were actually interpreted to the younger generation . I could also derive at various solutions to a single   problem but few of the solution only was accepted at that instance of time as the evaluator was not   able to foresee the other solution . 

 Application : References as book , friends as supporters , elders as guides , thought as philosophers and   actions as dedication and rewards as reflection . Every act of mine tried to fix up time for all as a tabular   column , I tried to schedule the day and maximized the utilization of valuable and quality time . I could   see there was more of time for each than required also could plan some more activities in the rest of the   time . I shared more informed and question all I could come across to gather more data and connect   those to develop to information and applied for my growth . 

 Insight : Could realize that self confidence , self respect and determination to achieve something has to   be set as goals and while travelling toward it , we should be bold enough to express and equally accept   both our success and defeat in such a way that we should develop the tendency to Defeat the Defeats   tendency . 

 Approach : The criteria that I adopted to make the success was <ADDRESS> , Regularity and   Reinforcement until I achieved my goal .

 possible solutions to the problem . I often use this approach with our customers , who 

 want a unique graphical works like flyers , posters , magazines and other print and web 

 media . 

 Application 

 I apply visualization by first creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . In 

 order to develop the straw man graphic , I sometimes from any existing material 

 available make a sketch to understand problem at hand . I sometimes get to know the 

 thoughts of my target audience by having an interview or chat with them . 

 Now in order to properly apply this design tool , I try to ask my client to explain what 

 he / she actually need in the graphic work to be done , I get to know her color choices , 

 brand and also what emotion the graphic work should convene . With the right 

 information I get from this client , I tend to make a picture of the intended designs , the 

 color combination , the light reflections and alignments , then sketching and designing 

 of the work begins . The end result is always an awesome job which the client 

 appreciates . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Some spectacular things I have learned from conducting this exercise with several 

 groups is that while try conversing the proposed graphic with a client , the have this 

 feeling of being in charge and this makes them more relaxed , focused and also being 

 able to give out maximum cooperation . 

 Visualizing a problem gives the different group of audience a focal point which enables 

 them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of 

 their problems . Through a collaborative manner , they could create the graphic from a 

 blank slate starting with a straw man jump which starts the conversation for them . 

 With this , they can quickly identify their position in the graphic , more also , they can 

 more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of 

 taking time to identify them . 

 With visualization , they can also identify variables in the problem space and be guided 

 on what area to get necessary information for the variables . 

 Since I discovered how exceptional visualization can be in a shared insights and 

 learning , I would never hesitate to use the visualization activity as a takeoff board for 

 my design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic with a combined feedback can 

 used as a reference tool throughout in the project .

"Challenge & Selection     I have used Visualization tool many times and have helped my team & customer stakeholders to achieve common   ground for defining problem and possible solution . The visualization tool is essential and adds more benefits to   build a direct connect with the customer & their core problems and issues . I am a business consultant and have   worked for many <ADDRESS> projects . My customers ’ faces critical issues like faster time to market , technology   upgrades and customer churn due to steep competition . Constant and consistent performance to achieve higher   growth with better cost control wears them down . The only way to sustain in the competitive <ADDRESS> market is to   identify growth wheels , new approach to achieve higher growth with cost optimization . The visualization tool helps   me and my customers in introspecting about how things are moving and at which direction , where do they want to   go and how we should approach . I personally like this tool because it opens the creative side of me and helps me   think beyond the problem areas to identify possible ideas . This tool gives me the much needed power to   empathize towards customer issues and helps me in ethnography mapping .     Application     I have used visualization tool in various ways . With telecom industry best practices and available customer   information , I first draw the organization chart and also the customer journey maps . Although these journey maps   are only for reference yet those are pure play drawings which have very basic information about every customer   stakeholder , its role and process to achieve desired output or outcome . During discussions , workshops and   meetings I use these maps as ice breakers . Neither these are final journey maps nor do those maps have all the   information . Hence these maps are used only for discussion to gather more information .     I also use drawing board to start mapping departments involved in the process . This helps me identify which   departments are involved in customer facing activities . This defines the Moment of Truth for the process . I use a   lot of post - its / sticky - notes and ask the participants to put their challenges and paste it on the board . Most of the   time , I create four to five vertical blocks on the board dedicated for each department and then start pasting all the   post - its received from the participants . This helps all the participants to see what information we have got and   what can be the real problem the organization is facing . Sometimes , more participants provide same / similar   problem or artifact in different words . Even though participants may represent different departments , yet their   inputs for the problem can be same . This helps me understand how deep this problem is impacting the   organization and helps me in prioritizing it for further investigation .     In my meetings , I expect at least 5 to 8 participants representing mostly the impacted departments . This helps me   get a better view of the journey that I mapped and also helps me understand the problem statement better . I   circulate post - its , color pens and papers to my participants . I take 3 ft by 3 ft size print - outs of the journeys and put   those on the meeting room walls . I also define customer touch points in my journey and ensure those are clearly   visible to the participants . I ask every participant to validate the process and identify the possible issues with the   journey . The participant has to put his point on the post - it and paste it on the process where he / she thinks a   problem area . I ask the participants following questions – 

 1 . Is the journey map having all the relevant information ?   2 . Is the flow of the journey map correct for your organization ?   3 . According to you , what are the problem areas in this journey map ?   4 . What needs to improve in this journey ? 

 Above points / questions are mainly to help them think what is the current situation of the organization and how   they think it can be solved . For me , it gives great insight into the organization and its people . Roughly after 15 - 20   mins of group discussion and small talk , each participant comes up with their own inputs and start pasting them on   the journey maps . First , I ask them to post only the relevant information inputs so that I can update the journey .   Secondly , I ask them to post only the issues / problems using key or power words and paste on the journey . I group   common inputs / suggestions and prioritize after discussing with the participants . After meeting with participants , I   recreate journey map with updated information based on the inputs received from the participants . I again share   the information with the same participant group and again try to get the inputs to improve the journey map till it is 

 accepted by the participant group . This data gathering helps both participants and me in understanding problem   areas , journey map and also defining the goal for the transformation .     Insight & Approach     The power of the visualization tool is immense . The diverse group can come together and start drawing their   thoughts either in the form of process maps , journey maps or even simple plane boxes that helps being every   participant on the common ground . As I mentioned earlier , I personally like this tool as it opens up creative   thinking side of human brain . It pushes the participant think beyond what he is seeing and it brings the best out of   him / her . The visualization tool enables participants and users to identify what are the various ways to look at   problem and solution . The use of this tool is diverse . It allows the third party consultants to empathize by   visualizing customer pain areas . It allows the diverse participant groups to empathize by visualizing beyond their   own problem areas . It creates the common ground for all the participants and also acts as an ice breaker most of   the time . Most of the time visualization tool allows the less speaking or shy participants a mean to communicate   with others and helps achieve desire result , if possible .     This tool I have used in my personal life also . Whenever my daughter wants to tell problem which she can not   explain , I have taught her to draw & highlight the problem areas . Most of the time , I get what she wants to explain .   She uses this tool to help understand me and my wife about her problem so that we can help her better .

"Storytelling : gathering ideas 

 1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 My challenge is writing a short text for our website about a new workshop to gather ideas   with a web based innovation tool . The difficulty is not to describe how the workshop and   tool work . The difficulty is to explain it in a way that is easy to read and understand for   everyone and not only people dealing with the topic “ innovation ” . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and 

 why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture   references ) . 

 <NAME> explains something by using easy understandable words . The topic explained is   wrapped in a story , like an example , so that the targeted audience can understand and   imagine it well . 

 <URL> 

 I chose storytelling , because the targeted audience should be able to understand it easy and   hopefully remember it long . The addressed people do often not know much about the topic   innovation and especially an idea software , therefore it is essential to avoid words which   need some deeper knowledge . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what 

 you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 When I wrote my text , I tried to use simple words and always imagined how I would explain   it to my grandma . Difficult was building a story , because if you have only limited space , you   ca n’t go to deep into it . Therefore , I tell the reader , what happens to him during he is going   through the process and let it look like he is on a “ idea ” journey . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your 

 challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about   design thinking more broadly ) . 

 I learned , that not going into details about something and always have in mind “ your   grandma ” must understand it as well , you are able to use words which make the whole text   more exciting . Going into details and explain something insightfully is not always necessary ,   it depends on the addressed readers . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool 

 you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 I think next time I would think first about a story of myself or some story I heard to make it   more personal . Thinking too much about the process of the topic makes it difficult to even   think about an appropriate story .     By the way , here is my result : 

 Innovative and creative with „ system “ for beginners and advanced     Is the right idea for new products , services or maybe a process missing ?   Would you like to improve your customer experience and strengthen customer loyalty ? We   take you on an exciting idea journey with a web - based tool for many new ideas .      Invite your employees , partners , customers , specialists or other interested parties to this   creative journey . The invitee can put in their ideas directly via computer or mobile phone . The   view from different angles makes you want to find ideas and animates the creativity , which   inspires the participants to always new flashes of inspiration .      The result is a multitude of innovative ideas , which are evaluated , commented and discussed .   In a 2 - day innovation boot camp , the most promising and exciting ideas are deepened and   recombined . At the end of the workshop , the top ideas are worked out and a clear action   plan is defined .

"Assignment : Design Thinking for Innovation 

 1 . Challenge : 

 We wished to test the viability of a fintech based solution that focused on addressing the full   spectrum of personal financial needs of the digitally / technologically - enabled client . 

 2 . Selection : 

 The design tool known as a “ learning launch ” was used . A learning launch is a small experiment   that tests a new idea in the targeted market place . 

 3 . Application : 

 The learning launch was used to test the extent of the market demand for the proposed service    as well as the usability of the service . This was done by using a prototype which focussed on 

 the user - interface and hence the user experience . We needed to understand if the client was   sufficiently able to help themselves if prompted in the right direction . 

 4 . Insight : 

 We determined that there was indeed a market for the service but that the user - interface 

 needed to be simplified a bit more as we had over - estimated the basic financial   education / readiness of the potential client base/ 

 5 . Approach : 

 We would probably have spent a bit more time studying the financial education / readiness of the   proposed target market upfront using the assumption testing tool . This would have allowed for a   better designed prototype .

"Storytelling 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of <NAME> , I work as a University professor at the Anand Ashram in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> where I have encounter with the topic recently . In a classroom full of   students you constantly need their attention , you need to find creative ways you keep them   interested in academic topics ; so I created a fiction character that review business cases from   different point of view though out each class ; I stared with a case where “ Polly ” reviewed a   local   business case called “ Los Paleteros ” . The story started with Polly intrigued on how the business   started and with walked among all her emotions when she discovered every step the local   business made to become the inspiring trendy entrepreneur case . She walked among innovation ,   failure , and success . The story not only created engagement to the students , but it create a new   skill set for me that I did not know I had . 

 Application 

 I started by investigating a new case study for my class , the case study is called LOS PALETEROS .   Once I started to share their story as Polly they audience was fully concentrated . The success od   los paleteros did not take them by surprise , but it arrived much sooner than they expected . The   owners Enrique Artiñano , <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> are still not aware of what happened ,   or how it happened . The truth is that in just eight months Los Paleteros and La <NAME>   monopolize social networks .     The <NAME> is one of the six ice creams produced by these entrepreneurs , it is a palette with   flavored granita filled with condensed milk and wrapped in powdered milk . Basicly it is like a port   churchill , but richer , which it also can be describe as a local ice cream made at the port of   <ADDRESS> in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> .     Polly explained that to achieve that ice cream <NAME> and <NAME> took almost three months trying   different chemical formulas that allowed them to reach the point , taste and texture they wanted   in their ice cream . The filling was a real issue , he wanted   the ice cream   pop to be filled with   powdered milk , but then it seemed better to fill it with condensed milk and pack it in powdered   milk . They tried 20 different types of condensed milk until we found the one that remained within   the ice cream . The Paleteros opened their accounts on Facebook and Instagram just on March 4    2016 and that 's where everything started .     So we can be on the same page the Churchill ice cream looks like this and it is sold on the port of 

 <ADDRESS> in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> : , los paleteros came up with the following product   . 

 It looks amazing right , they capture every single element innovating the product and expanding   throughout the country . With the story I tooked them thru the 20 diferent types of condensed   milk and up to the success they did not imagen in such a short period of time . So by my second   class where I once more shared the story I tooked the to the next level I have them imagine   the 

 same path but I good better and more into the story that as a result   eight student order 8   churchiletas trough UberEats after class and invited me . My story Telling improved once I closed   the story with them imagining them eating a churchuleta therefore the invitation . Plus , they   reflected that all start ups have their ups and downs , the importance of keep going and fighting for   your dreams even if it ’s creative .      Link to the company mentioned before : <URL>      Insight & Approach     What I have learned from this experience , is that can still improve a initiating the story telling   and   I can also improve on timing in order to keep it short and keep the audience more interested ,   practice makes the difference . Storytelling has become popular in marketing as a tool to connect   with audiences , get out of the cold and stubborn way of talking about business , and achieve   greater empathy with potential customers . These are some of the advantages of telling stories   around a business case that I found and would like to share :     - A story not only tells a reality differently , it shows a different side . Unveils unknown aspects and   builds confidence .     - A story manages to capture a sequence and a flow of events , which makes it easy to remember .     - Being easy to remember , they are easy to transmit . The stories are shared , generating voice to   voice .     - A good story helps you to influence the interpretation that people give to the data . The story   gives a context about which the data makes sense and relates to     - We love a good story and we never tire of listening to them again and again . They do the   complex simple and give a different dimension to everyday life .     - We all have a heart . A story makes us human and close . It turns the cold image of an anonymous   company into people who can be trusted .       I definitely know that I will be using <NAME> as a tool of design thinking , because We all have a   history , we all have a motivation , a reason why we do what we do .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 The <ADDRESS> , a non - profit organization has established its sustainability through teaching   ( classroom / online ) and selling educational materials . The problem is the fact that debate is not   institutionalized in our region . That is the first obstacle – to educate customers about what debate is . And   the second one – to find the right channel of communication in order to reach our customers so that we   can “ GET – KEEP – GROW ” . 

 Selection 

 In order to do that , we are supposed to : 

 1 ) Do a research 

 2 ) Build our <ADDRESS> 

 3 ) Brainstorm the channels 

 We have decided to use the visualization as a tool at all stages in order to be on the same page . The other   reason why we decided to use visualization is because we have found it the most useful tool in the process   of brainstorming . 

 Application 

 At the first stage , visualization helped us present the results of the research . Once presented with a graph ,   they were easily understood by everyone . 

 The second stage was even easier . This time we did not visualize the direct customers ( 80 % of our   customers are Middle and High school students ) , but the indirect ones - their parents . Parents are the   ones who approve , but the questionnaire has shown that the one who influenced our members the most   in order to apply and attend were the parents , relatives and older friends . So , we have decided to pay   more attention to these indirect customers . Visualization helped us bridge the gap between building the   persona and brainstorming the channels , because what appeared to be the most dominant picture was   “ home ” . 

 That is how we have decided on our third stage to place our channels of communication in the House :   that is the place where the family meets , where they discuss , make decisions , so that should be the   place where the information about debate and our Club should arrive as well . 

 We all have decided on info graph as a tool that could be useful not only for our team , but also for the   stakeholders outside of our organization . 

 Insight 

 Visualizing the home and family atmosphere , we have   visualized : 

 1 ) discussions around the table during the meal ; 

 2 ) food preparation in kitchen ; 

 3 ) vlog / video / blog in everyone ’s free time ( instead of   newspapers ) ; 

 4 ) photos and posts on social media for the same reasons . 

 In order to achieve our first channel , we have projected   storytelling and opened resolutions on a weekly basis   through flyers , newsletters , blogs . 

 To get into the kitchen , we might partner with someone and   produce perheps “ debate cookies ” instead of “ fortune   cookies ” , with a resolution inside of the cookie that can be   a topic to reflect about during the day and debate with   friends and family . 

 The easiest one was the third idea – creating   vlogs / videos / blogs , which goes for the fourth one as well . 

 Finally , we have come up with a question of “ What is   important for our customers ? ” , and have learned that it is   the progress of their children , so we have decided to work   on monthly newsletters and individual report . 

 Approach 

 Although Visualization helped us come up with “ needs and   importance ” of our stakeholders , it left our insight with   “ may / might / could ” strategy . What we learned is that we   have placed the most important stage at the smallest part   of the graph , not leaving enough space for each of these 

 concepts to grow and improve . The approach we have used was “ the stream of consciusness ” instead of   “ targeting the essence ” . 

 What we intend to improve with our next graph is : 

 1 ) placing the first and the second stage together as direct and indirect customers ; 

 2 ) placing “ GET - KEEP - GROW ” strategy on two 2/3 of the graph . That approach would allow us to   develop each of the channels we have brainstormed in details , which would open a need for a new   project for each of the products / services mentioned in the channel section .

"Design Thinking for Innovation   Final Project - <NAME> <NAME>     Challenge 

 We are a small company of 30 talented employees with 46 % being Millennial . The leadership team   consists of 5 key individuals that lead the organization making well thought out decisions as a group or   as their daily responsibilities require it . With a desire to retain the entire staff it is our responsibility to   foster ways to enhance the employee experience . The idea came to launch Generational Meetings and   we started with the Millennial group first . We wanted to create a space for people to have a voice ,   stimulate discussions and result in ideas to grow the organization organically . What we did not expect   was the impact on other Generational groups and a feeling of exclusion . 

 Selection 

 As an organization we had not gone through Design Thinking training , so I am seeing that our approach   was Experimental and had the characteristics of the Learning Launch method . We were able to use the   Learning Launch tools as an experiment and quite quickly test this idea . 

 Application 

 For the first Learning Launch we assembled the staff of Millennial ’s , I gave a statement that this was an   experiment and if it was just this one meeting that was fine . If it gained strength and fostered ideas for   company growth and employee commitment it would be a win . There were some ground rules set to   maintain structure and to stimulate engagement . The rules were : 

    No leadership in the meetings – strictly Millennial “ non ” managers . 

    While this is meant to be a safe environment to share ideas , concerns and solutions , it was not   meant to create negative discussions . Should an issue be discussed it was to generate a solution . 

    Assign a spokesperson that would report back after the meetings , so the leadership team could   address each item one at a time and act on requests as appropriate . 

 As the Learning Launch went on , the group met success and continued to meet quarterly for one year .   They titled themselves the Young Professionals . 

 Insight 

 The meetings proved to be extremely fruitful and brought solid bonding as well . The YP ’s followed the   rules of engagement and with one hour each quarter , they brought not only ideas but actual solutions to   such topics as employee training , client experience through social media , web site overhaul to include   professional input and several simple changes in the office and social events to add to our employee   centric culture . 

 However , it was after the fact that we offered <NAME> - X the same opportunity and that fell short for several   reasons : 

    Hurt feelings of not being included originally . 

    Feeling that their ideas did not matter – too old . 

    Did not have the same experience of high energy and thought - provoking conversations . 

    Focused on what is not working during their discussions thus bringing down morale . 

 A complete opposite experience ! 

 What did we do ? As a leadership team we had to determine a best solution to support all the good we   were witnessing from the YP group yet engage everyone to bridge the generational gap . The only way to   do this was to bring the groups together and create a new voice of the people . We did just that . We now   have a “ non - mandatory ” group entitled the “ Creative Innovations ” committee . They meet quarterly   with sub - groups doing work in teams between each gathering . This began in Q1 of 2019 and the energy   is positive as we await results . 

 <NAME> 

 Due to our Design Thinking training , we will be utilizing the different methods as appropriate with the   Creative Innovations committee . We are excited to execute and experiment with the different tools   knowing the future holds compelling results .

"Challenge   At our company we frequently partner up with different companies to enable us to widen our service   offering to our customer . One of these partnerships is a company that specializes in advisory   regarding precautionary measures that protects and ensures your will if anything unexpected should   happen to you . The idea is that the advisor of our company informs our customers about the offering   during their consultation meeting and creates awareness for the topic , ultimately generating leads   for our partner . 

 The challenge at hand is that , though the campaign has been active for quite some time , there are   too few leads generated and it has been observed that the advisors often do n’t mention the offering   at all . The goal is therefore , to identify due to what reason the advisors seem to avoid mentioning the   partnership to our customers . By applying design thinking techniques , we want to find a solution in   order to increase leads . 

 Selection   One thesis of ours is that the customers as well as the advisors do n’t understand the offering . The   advisor has the difficult task to sell a service that he knows very little about . He hesitates to even   mention it , because he could be seen as incompetent if he ’s not able to answer questions the   customer has . The customer on the other hand comes to the consultation meeting with the intention   to buy an insurance not being offered a service about precautionary measures for his life . In order to   convince the customer to invest money for a further meeting with our partner , the offering has to be   very clear and the advisor has to be convinced by the service himself . 

 As mentioned in the <NAME> video storytelling creates a cause for something . It gives a reason that   the audience understands . It has a clear sequence of events and connects emotions and values of our   customers with the underlying service by our partner . The offering has to be laid out in a manner   that the customers find themselves within the story presented by the advisor . 

 Thus , we chose to create a story that suits the advisor and the customer at the same time , while it   also adapts to the customer ’s intrinsic values . 

 Application   The story that we wanted to tell should be easy understandable for the advisors and it should create   a need for precautionary measures for our customers . In different discussions we tried to put   ourselves into the position of both our advisors and our customers . 

 We then tried to reveal the needs of both in order to create a story . In the end we decided to go with   a story that we think both parties can identify themselves with . By pointing out a real - life example of   what can happen if people do n’t discuss precautionary measures when they ’re still able to we   wanted to increase engagement by both the advisors and the customers . A very famous and   illustrative case is the one of late - Formula 1 racer <NAME> <NAME> . Since his accident his   decision are made for him by the child and adult protection agency and not by his family . This would   be different if he would have settled such questions before his accident . 

 We think that by picturing the possible outcomes , customers and advisors might be able to   understand the importance of the service that our partner offers . Obviously , this does n’t change the   terms and conditions of the service , however it provides a story that both can relate to . 

 Insight   By applying storytelling we thought about the underlying values of both the advisor and the   customer . We were able to put ourselves in their shoes and see the situation through their eyes . We   also revealed that there are possibly further challenges to the problem at hand , because perhaps the 

 lack of understanding of the service is n’t the only reason the partnership has n’t been successful so   far . We realized that the service itself also has to be further adapted and personalized , as not all   customers have the same needs regarding precautionary measures . It all depends on their current   life situations . Consequently , it may make sense to adapt the service itself , as well as the story to   each customer individually . 

 Approach   Storytelling is one possible solution for the challenge at hand . However , considering the insights   generated , we would choose a mix of different tool next time . The tool we used , sheds light for a   specific perspective . By applying a different design thinking tool we would probably get different   results , however . Thus , to get deeper insights in the challenge posed in our project we will apply   further tools .

"Design Thinking for Innovation Assignment :   Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 This is a challenge pertaining to the real estate industry .   It is a business transformation challenge   where there is a dire need to move traditional marketing into digital marketing space in order to   generate buyer leads . 

 Most property agents are accustomed to traditional marketing methods such as road shows , door- knocking , cold - calling , sending mailers , newspaper ads , etc . Some of these methods have been   around for a long time because it allows the agents to access their potential targets quite easily .   For   eg ,   in my country ,   door - knocking clearly targets certain community house owners who may have a   higher potential to buy another property near their vicinity so that their children can live near to   them . However , clearly , in today ’s age , traditional marketing is deemed intrusive , expensive ,   time- consuming and does not work as well . 

 To move into digital marketing for lead generation , the challenge is to discover how we could move   traditional marketing into the digital space while yielding higher quality buyer leads , use less agent ’s   time , and cost less advertising dollars per lead . We decide to use design thinking to solve this   challenge . 

 Selection 

 The team has already gone pass the “ What is ” and “ What if ” stage . At this point , the team has a   reasonable understanding of the potential buyer profile , demographics , interest that could make   them a high quality buyer lead if we could reach out to them effectively in the digital space . The   team has also decided to use Facebook advertising as a small scale experiment and use the <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> tool to discover possible targeting ideas within Facebook ads that could yield the best quality   leads at the lowest advertising cost . 

 Application 

 Before we use the Learning Launch tool ,   we made some assumptions on which targeting method   within FaceBook that would accomplish our challenge objectives .   We did the targeting configuration   based on the buyer ’s profile ( discovered in the “ what is ” stage ) and ran a small advertising budget   for 2 weeks . During the two weeks , we analyse the number of buyer leads that we got , the potential   of them ( high quality or low quality )   and the cost per lead . 

 The results that we got was not what we desired .   While some buyer leads were of high quality , the   cost per lead was much higher than expected .   Something was amissed in the way we configured the   targeting .   We re - look into our starting assumptions , kept what we felt was working with our results ,   but change some of the other assumptions after engaging with those buyer leads who are less   interested in our properties . 

 We made a 2nd run of the Learning Launch tool after re - adjusting our targeting options , making use   of the information that we got from the acquired buyer leads . This time round ,   the results were far   better ;   we managed to acquire buyer leads who are truly interested in our properties at a much   lower advertising cost per lead . As these were really keen buyers , we also have had better   engagements with them with less time consumed as compared to traditional marketing methods . 

 Insights 

 The Learning Launch tool was great in testing our assumptions under a small scale environment .    Very quickly , we realised the following insights : 

 1 ) Despite a great deal of work in discovering the high potential buyer leads profile and 

 property needs through the “ what is ” stage , the learning launch allow us to re - adjust our   findings and assumptions as it gets into a real life situation .   Some of the assumptions   derived from the “ what is ” stage were not wrong ; they were just not suitable for the current   properties that we are selling , but those assumptions could be useful for other category of   properties . 

 2 ) The learning launch tool allows us to make mistakes fast and cheap . During the 2 weeks of 

 the first run , we knew something was wrong but because the budget we used was relatively   low , we could quickly pivot to other assumptions without heavy losses . 

 3 ) We realised that some of the initial assumptions tested were due to personal/ experience 

 biasness that may have contributed to the poor results of the first launch . 

 Approach     The learning launch was a great tool that eventually allow us to successfully transform our   traditional marketing methods to digital marketing which is less intrusive , better leads quality and   lower ad cost per lead . However , if we were to re - use the learning launch tool again ( on another   challenge ) , we would include a few more members of varying experience and know - how to mitigate   away any personal / experience biasness in designing the Learning Launch .

"Storytelling 

 Background & Selection- 

 Storytelling is really an effective and we all are listening stories since childhood . We connect   to characters , to emotions , to learnings , the values in the stories . We often convey   messages in broader way and with logic . We always should consider about the audience , to   whom we want to connect . The relevant topic will connect them and they will listen to it   from heart , no matter about circumstances . 

 I work in a manufacturing unit as section manager . There are workman on shopfloor , who   come from a small villages near by and comparatively have less educational qualification . It   is often cases that housekeeping and delayed production in particular area was below par   and every time I have to aware about it and after some words to them they could carry it   out . But it was not a practice and each time we get few downgrades in the area . To make a   considerable difference , I used tool of storytelling and started it more often to up keep the   area . 

 Application- 

 I told them a story of making tea . We make tea in kitchen and what if we keep the required   things all over our home ? What if we switch on the gas and went to market looking for   lighter ? What if tea is ready and we are looking for cup and finding it after 15 minute ? What   will happen when guests visit   your home and you are taking longer time to make a cup of   tea ? Thus I was able to make them realise the importance of keeping all tools at right place ,   a place of each toll , periodic cleaning of machines , prepare well before start of machine . I   also arranged small video from Mercedes Class production line . The things were tidy , ease   of work and fresh look to area .   By telling the importance of up keeping and asking many   questions , I was able to make them realise the importance of house keeping , tools at right   place , energy saving and the increased output and productivity . 

 <NAME> 

 After the sessions for all workman , we found that change in the work centre . A classic house   keeping and participation from all workman lead to increase in grades . There was   enthusiasm all over place and whopping increased productivity … . Fantastic . 

 Now , I always think of new stories and implement new ideas in other areas . It has been very   beneficial in short span of time and desired results .

"Challenge 

 As the Operations Manager , my challenge was to offer additional access to sleep study procedures in   response to the COVID-19 pandemic . We had closed our Sleep Lab to gather the necessary resources and   stand - up new processes to safely resume services at our facility . This was an approach taken by most   organizations during this time . However , this course of action would knowingly create ambiguous delays and   increase safety concerns for patients currently at - risk of sleep disordered breathing . The project scope   included : product testing / selection , information technology risk analysis , vendor legal agreements ,   procurement , supply chain management , workflow design , staff training , and marketing . However , internal   resources were extremely limited ( i.e. , timeline , budget , staff ) . We needed to offer access to as much of our   patient population as possible within the next two weeks to mitigate disruptions in care . 

 Selection 

 The Learning Launch tool was utilized to quickly determine if a disposable at home sleep test product would   generate quality and affordable , non - contact sleep study procedures for patients at the start of the COVID-19   pandemic . The essence of the Learning Launch tool is to learn . It ’s a carefully designed learning experiment   that can be conducted with high economic efficiency in limited timespans . This is significant because it allows   the gathering of data to determine if an idea has enough value to warrant further examination and allocation   of additional resources ( i.e. , timeline , budget , staff ) . 

 Application 

 I function within a Mochi Milk , myself and the Sleep Lab ’s Medical Director applied the Learning Launch   tool by first immersing ourselves in market research to investigate solutions for serving patients while the   facility was closed . We then generated the idea of adding a disposable at home sleep test product to our   services that would center around the strategy of eliminating contact while continuing to provide care . What   we did n’t know was the product ’s ease - of - use . I organized a virtual demonstration of the product between us   and the vendor sales representative to further articulate this information . 

 In the meeting we focused on gaining knowledge for the hardware and software functionality to determine   how user - friendly the product appeared . Given our limited resources we would be the primary team   members operating the system until further team members were returned to work . We felt comfortable with   the patient reviews , system capabilities , and overall anticipated experience to move forward with testing a   device . We simultaneously initiated the information technology risk analysis to confirm the product met all   security standards . 

 Our Medical Director agreed to personally test the equipment to obtain the patient - perspective . She received   the device by mail and was able to perform the recording without complications . The next day we were able   to download and review the at home collected study on our facility computer system , without requiring   return of device or any physical contact . This concluded that the selected product could provide the solution   we were seeking . 

 We began processing vendor legal agreements while diving into the remaining training materials and starting   the workflow design . We learned about gaps in applying the training materials to scoring the studies and   developed our own algorithm to offer greater clarity for future staff training . Once the vendor legal   agreements were completed , we added the product to our supply chain management system and placed our   first shipment of supplies . 

 Our Medical Director conducted video visits with our first few patients to receive the new devices . The at   home disposable sleep test unit connects to an App on a smart device , such as a tablet or mobile phone . This   required all patients to attest to their competency with the technology involved before the test was ordered .   Once the test was ordered we obtained prior authorization for coverage of patient ’s insurance . Then all the   necessary materials were packaged and sent directly to the patient ’s home with a prefilled return envelope   to receive all necessary paperwork . 

 Following the roll - out to actual customers we discovered that many were not returning the paperwork post- test . Therefore , we refined and improved the workflow by creating our own electronic consent to be   delivered via email , prior to shipment of the device , and instructed patients to return images of completed   paperwork to the thread following their recording . This significantly increased the success rate of receiving   post - test paperwork that supported interpretation of test results . 

 Insight 

 By applying the Learning Launch tool , our team was able to rapidly engage stakeholders in the creation ,   design , and testing of the product . We assumed this new technology would offer a contactless way of   providing care to our patients while the lab was closed and would continue to be scalable after reopening .   We tested this hypothesis and worked through results . Our actual results showed significant success while   the lab remained closed . However , after reopening we had a substantial number of patients go through the   entire process of receiving their devices but later deciding to postpone or fail to complete their recordings .   This led to us scale back and require further revision for improvement before moving forward again . This   experience instilled the understanding that the stages of design thinking are not always sequential . They ca   be run in parallel , out of order , and are frequently repeated in an iterative manner . 

 <NAME> 

 Given the context we were in at the beginning of the pandemic the learning launch tool was appropriate .   Now that our timeline resource has improved , another useful tool would be <NAME> <NAME> . This would help   us look for patterns and themes in the data we ’ve collected from our first launch to expand more creative   solutions for the scale design challenge . Additionally , our team needs to review the insights gained from our   first launch and incorporate these into future launch designs .

"Reflection   - Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I and my friend started working on a startup which aimed at increasing research   interests among students . We thought the idea is really good and started 1 of our   several services on the same . But the results were not as expected . We were not   getting very positive feedback on our product . We wanted to analyze and redesign the   product and our service so as to reach more people and fulfil our target of improving   students count in the research domain . We wanted to analyse the shortcomings of our   idea , the behaviour of our customers and their thoughts regarding the same .     Selection 

 We both realised that we made a number of assumptions while making the business   plan . We needed to know the actual data using a few experiments and user research .     Application 

 We started by focusing on our goal that at the end what do we want to achieve : ‘ To   increase research interests among students ’ . And what are the reasons that there is a   need for doing so ? We did user research to find that . We found many reasons , one of   them being the low pay in research than in the corporate world . We can not increase the   pay , of course , it ’s not in our hand , but we can do something else . We tried to find out   why those students who are interested in research ultimately end up doing corporate   jobs . We note down the problems faced by them in making their career in the research   domain and focused on one of the problems at a time . We built a hypothesis and   designed a few solutions to those problems . Multiple solutions for each problem . Then   we picked one at a time and performed experiments to find the best solution for that   problem .      After finalising the solutions to 3 problems we built a business model around those   solutions . We made a complete timeline and used agile framework to distribute work   among the team . At last , we started working on the project . And the results were   awesome . We got much better feedback on our new products and services . 

 Insight 

 This powerful tool ‘ learning launch ’ helped us in realising that some of our assumptions   were wrong . We worked around them and finally found a good hypothesis to play   around with . Our team is really happy with the results .      Approach 

 Learning launch was the best tool for us as the beginning on our project , but at this   stage , we need to use more tools like visualization and storytelling to attract more   customers and explain the need of the hour .

"Reflection Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I work in a market research agency . We recently developed a new approach to analyse   consumer behavior and opinions from web sources . After testing the approach in a small scale ,   we find the results very promising as they provide rich and valuable insights . However , at this   point our approach requires a lot of manual work and thus is rather inefficient – especially on a   larger scale . We would like to develop a fully automated process of our approach that provides   the same valuable insights as found in our tests – but much more efficient . This means ,   however , that our company has to make an investment in our approach . This again , means we   will have to convince a number of stakeholders of our approach , make them believe in us and   eventually release a budget for the investment . 

 Selection 

 I think the key to success , to convince the budget managers of our idea , is to wrap it into an   inspiring , emotionally involving story . <NAME> <NAME> ’s contribution about the storytelling tool in   week 2 of this fantastic course really was an eye opener here . After watching the rather short   video it became very clear to me that in order to make this idea successful we would have to go   beyond presenting a solid plan . We would have to share our excitement about the idea , make   the stakeholders see our vision . Even though until now I have never been a great storyteller – I   decided to make a start with this challenge . 

 Application 

 To create a stage for our story , we initiated a meeting with budget managers and other   stakeholders of the company . As usual , we created a PowerPoint presentation as a means for   sharing our ideas . This time , however , we made sure the presentation was n’t just about   projecting figures on the wall . This time we wanted to give the figures a personal touch ,   something that the audience could identify with . We did this by conveying the perspective of   the users we seek to analyse in the course of our approach . So our story was about a fictional 32   year old man who is interested in buying a specific kind of product . We showed real pictures to   give an impression of his personality , his family , his home – to facilitate an ethnographic glimpse   into the living environment of this specific persona . Even more important , we told the audience   how he informed himself and talked to other like - minded people about the product and where   to buy it ( which we knew about from testing our approach ) . 

 Insight 

 Our presentation had a very positive impact on the participants and lead to an exciting   discussion about the chances , the possible insights and findings our approach helps to reveal . It   was great to see how the participants immersed into the world of our fictional character ,   identified themselves with him , and even added pieces from their own personal experience to 

 the story . Of course , we also evoked criticism towards our new approach which we openly   addressed instead of trying to dismiss it . Quite the contrary , we showed appreciation for   constructive feedback as it is helpful for us to anticipate obstacles and find better solutions . 

 Approach 

 Overall , choosing the storytelling tool was a great decision . It turned out that embedding all   information in an inspiring and emotionally involving story was the best thing we could do . It   helped to pitch our approach to the rest of our company in a matter that everyone else could   see its value as we see it hence it is vital to get them on our side so that we can move forward   now and collaboratively create a great new service for our customers .

"Challenge in Projects , by <NAME> <NAME>     <NAME> 1 

 Challenge in Projects - Identify Root cause and enable department to work on improvements . 

 1 . Challenge 

 Not aligned working process and understanding of responsibilities in projects .   Project stakeholders have no common understanding of the working process and   responsibilities of the assigned role . This is causing massive delay and unwanted discussions /   confusion in projects . 

 2 . Selection 

 I selected the tool VISUALIZATION ( Module 1 ) to easily enable the workshop participants to   draft , draw / sketch their view of the process . 

 In week 1 , the 7 minute video “ Visualization Tool ” , shows that it is great to enable thinking in   a nonverbal way .   Quote : ” The visualization is a really core component of the way that we communicate ,   whether we 're aware of it or not . When we 're dealing with very complex problems , we 're   actually enacting a different kind of problem solving that has to bring in more than just logic . ” 

 3 . Scope 

 Identify Root cause and enable the department to work on improvements . 

 4 . Application 

 My approach is conducting workshops with all project stakeholders to gather their   understanding of the process , including the good sides and the pain points .   To be efficient I invite all stakeholders in groups owning the same role in projects . Each group   size should be limited to 4 - 6 participants .   Each stakeholder shall provide the understanding of their role in project and which   challenges they face .   The best tool to do this is using visualization .   Each participants uses a white board and later on colored sticky notes “ POSTIT ” . The   participant results and working process will be documented by taking photos of the white   boards and the group . 

 As basis I provide the structure of the main stages of the process as entry point ( e.g.   Initiation , Planning , Realization and Closure ) . For each of the main stages the participant shall   visualize the details of the owned role .   Preferably I combine the visualization with another powerful tool to support each of the   “ stages ” -the “ Six Thinking Hats ” by the <NAME> . This tool will provide the research with all   necessary angles from stakeholder and role perspective during each of the main stages .   The green and blue hat will not be used during this workshop . : 

 Challenge in Projects , by <NAME> <NAME>     <NAME> 2 

 a. Each of the stakeholders visualized their own understanding of the respective 

 process , relevant for their role . Starting with the “ White Hat ” as basis . 

 b. Next step was to add colored sticky notes with comments and details to the relevant 

 area of their visualization , using the “ Yellow Hat ” . 

 c. Proceeding in the same manner with the black hat and finally with the red hat on . 

 Past conducting all workshops the information we had on hand enable us to understand each   of the areas . From facts , pros , cons until the pain points , individually mapped to the process   of each project role .    By using the Design Thinking the information we gathered was overwhelming , in regard to   quantity and quality . It enabled us to understand if all roles were affected and to identify the   root cause(s ) of the challenge . It also clearly showed the strong and positive points of the   process and roles . Great information to work on prototypes bringing this department and   even involved departments to the next level , also by using Design Thinking . 

 5 . Insight 

 I learned again that visualization is a great universal language . It is easier to understand and   to compare than just the written word by most people . The tool is a great supportive   acceptance factor . It easy to approach and can be used by most people .   In addition it is a perfect basis to visually highlight exactly the pain points and good phases .   In our case the colored sticky note showed exactly the reference point in the process that it   referred to .   Using not just a “ blank ” page as basis but giving a small guidance also helped to keep   discussion to the topic instead of having participants struggling to know where to start .. 

 Challenge in Projects , by <NAME> <NAME>     <NAME> 3 

 6 . Approach 

 Instead of using the “ old style ” way of just using sticky notes and grouping them per topic I   will remain using visualization . It is much more natural and brings the people much faster   into the topics . It even helps the people to identify gaps and gain a much better   understanding of the topics . Just by the “ self ” reflection during the visualization drafting . If I   would remain with the “ old ” style ” I would not get the additional benefits of an easier   approach , more information with better quality .   This time visualization together with the bono hat was very suitable . It provided great inside   view and even brought to light that the root cause was not just limited to the department . It   enabled us to understand the “ as is “ situation and to reach out to the other departments   that are involved to solve and improve the situation .   Next time I will remain using the visualization tool as “ entry ” point but I will check what tool   in addition shall be used in addition to be efficient in fact finding .   And I will spread knowledge of Design Thinking in my department . I will encourage the   people to use the tools and approaches in full paramount : Before you begin , What is ? , What   if ? , What wows ? until What works ?

"Peer - graded Assignment Assignment – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I used was the tool of <NAME> <NAME> , to understand problems & to seek possible solution 

 for them . That time , I was in charge of developing new Business Model for Future Store ( a.k.a . Smart 

 Store or <NAME> <NAME> ) and had a lot of meeting with stakeholders both in our company and in 

 our customers ’ companies . I have used mind mapping often with my colleagues to find out better 

 solution which is economically not burdensome for customers and profitable for our company . Why 

 did I choose mind mapping ? Because it is a very useful tool that people who have difficulty 

 imagining can use to confirm their thoughts . Mind mapping helps you to connect one thought to 

 another with a tail - hooked to it . 

 Application 

 I worked in the order of Observation → Imagination → Composition , and the imagination process 

 was helped by mind mapping a lot . 

 First , I researched global best practices such as amazon - go and bingo - box and analyzed them in 

 detail . I looked into the technologies used for the cases and how to apply the technologies and 

 how to improve them . User scenarios including movement lines were also a major area of interest . 

 Second , I did mind mapping with my colleagues in different places . We usually did in the meeting 

 rooms , but sometimes we go to new and fresh places other than the office . Every time we did mind 

 mapping , some ideas we never expected came out and helped the project . 

 Each of us selected key words for Future Store , wrote them on the postit and pasted them on the 

 white board . We started mind mapping from here . we were able to create better ideas by connecting 

 keywords more and it was decided to construct a store with the concept of a “ face recognition- 

 based SCO(Self <NAME> - <NAME> ) refrigerator ” by linking words such as “ ABC(AI - Big dats - Cloud ) tech ” and 

 “ hands - free ” . We have also linked the technologies of security subsidiaries such as ' Smart Intrusion 

 Detection ' to connect various Future Store ideas . 

 Third , we got into composition . It 's a step to determine the overall mood of the store , the type of 

 technology to use , user scenarios , and other tricks . Since there were no SCO products , we decided 

 to make SCO products , and we looked for related technologies and vendors . For the AI refrigerator , 

 we chose one of the startups to collaborate . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with colleagues is that One person 's thoughts 

 may be flawed , but when combined , there is no shortage , and rather , it becomes a superb concept 

 which can change the world . Mind mapping showed how we can connect and improve ideas and 

 allowed us to share our perspectives and develop insights into potential “ big money making ” 

 business model . If I have done this Future Store project by myself without <NAME> <NAME> , I would 

 never have decided to make out own SCO for sure . 

 Design Thinking is a tool that helps we think fun and enjoyable . If we have more thoughts , is n't it 

 just our head getting complicated ? If we do n't stop and keep walking along the path of thought , 

 then we will meet real thoughts and the excitement at that time will make us happy enough to 

 make me forget all the sufferings . For this , I will try to use and combine the Design Thinking tools 

 according to the situation and hopefully then I will become one of the evangelist of Design Thinking .

"Visualization 

 Some years ago , I was working in academic research on a large research project , with industry and   academic partners . The project added a semantic layer on top of business processes descriptions , where   these enhanced ( semantic ) descriptions allowed for the automation or simplification of some tasks   during the business process execution . 

 Challenge : I noticed it was a steep learning curve for the industry partners to learn and use these   semantically annotated descriptions , because they had to learn a new modeling language and these   descriptions quickly became very complex and very difficult to debug in a textual form . For example , a   business process expert had to write a query as shown in “ Serialization of Query ” in figure 2 below . 

 Selection : In order to reduce the pain points of the industry partners , I decided to create a visual editor   tool .   The purpose of the visual editor was to simplify creating , updating and understanding semantic   descriptions , without a lot of expertise in the underlying modeling language . 

 Application : I started with some concept sketches ( e.g. , fig . 1 ) , to get an initial idea of how a user would   interact with the tool , and , after some refinements , I built the visual editor in fig . 2 . 

 Fig 1 . Concept sketches 

 <NAME> 2 . A screenshot of the tool I built 

 Insight : The visual editor was very well received by the industry partners . This tool was not in the   original project scope , but it got included in SENTINEL ( a monitoring and management tool that was in   the scope of the project ) . Visual editors reduce the learning curve , as well as the time needed to   produce well formed and bug free content . 

 Approach : Concept sketches are a great way to do quick initial tests of your ideas , as well as deepen   your understanding of what you need to build and how users will interact with the tool .

"Storytelling 

 “ The worst nightmare ” Case 

 Challenge & Selection : 

 <NAME> has been one of my most useful tools , not only work wise but   life wise . It ’s given me the opportunity to communicate thoughts , ideas   and data in the easiest and most direct way , since it gives me the chance   to make people identify and engage with my message , because let ’s be   honest , everyone wants to hear a good story . 

 I work at an advertising agency and a few months ago my colleagues and I   found ourselves in front of a challenge with a big client , a chain of   hypermarkets . They wanted to promote their huge black friday sales , with   an extremely limited budget , so we had to come up with clever and   eﬀective solutions that did n’t require much money or a big production . Our   worst nightmare . 

 Application : 

 Once we had the client ’s context and goals ﬁgured out , we started our   “ what if ” phase and began to brainstorm possible solutions to the main   problem . It sure was a tough phase . How could we let people know our   client had the best sales they could ever ﬁnd , with no outdoor or printed   ads , a huge BTL production or a well positioned TV spot ? Then , during our   breaking point , I began to my colleagues the story of how I got my almost   brand new iPhone for a ridiculous price on Facebook ’s Marketplace   platform . After I told them my story we realized we never thought of that   one place where people look for the biggest sales : the internet . Consumer- consumer e - commerce platforms are incredibly popular between those   who are always looking for the best prices . 

 And we came up with a great idea : To create an online proﬁle for our client   in the most popular consumer - consumer e - commerce platforms in <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> ( Facebook ’s Marketplace , <NAME> <NAME> , OLX ) in order to post   their top Black Friday Sale products , just like a normal person who sells   from home would do . People went crazy ! They were truly attracted to the   prices and got really surprised when they realized they contacted one of 

 the largest chain of hypermarkets for more details on the products . We   truly had their attention , just as intended . 

 And of course , storytelling was n’t only a tool that made part of our   brainstorming session . In order to “ sell ” the idea to our client , we told it in   the best way possible : through a story . My story , and the story of many   others who had similar experiences to mine , since we collected an   important amount of information throughout interviews and surveys in   order to strengthen our insights . 

 Insights and <NAME> : 

 This past experience opened our eyes . Sometimes , as advertisers or   professionals of the creative ﬁeld , pay so much attention to the given data   and obstacles given by our clients , that we put focus on the many ways to   solve their problems without even thinking about the core of our whole   purpose : the people , the customers , our target and their lives . Throughout   storytelling you can understand why your target behaves in a certain way   when confronting a problem and then tell them what the solution to that   problem is , all of this through a story they can identify with . I think that ’s   gold right there and we , as communicators , should look for that gold in   every single work that we get done .

"VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Menstrual health and hygiene discussions with teenage girls is usually an intricate affair .   Most girls at this age are usually very shy and easily embarrassed when such topics are   brought up . To gather any insights from them in relation to this topic becomes an uphill task   that requires a thoroughly thought through approach that will get them to comfortably   open up and share information . 

 To gather insights from schoolgirls in designing a new sanitary pad , we used the visualization   tool to stir up conversations . The main visualization tool was images and colors . This made it   easier to stir up emotions and start conversations around menstrual health and hygiene   which is a very uncomfortable topic among young girls . 

 Application 

 We started by designing different visuals for the packaging . We had three different visuals   that we placed in front of the girls . One was a flower design , the second was the image of a   playful girl and the third one was just an abstract image that did not really say much .   Regarding the colors , we used red , blue and purple which were integrated into the three   different images . In total we had nine different design variation when we combined the   three different images with the three different colors . 

 We then put together a group of nine girls aged between thirteen to sixteen years and   decided to show them the different sets of images at different stages . 

 First , we brought out the first three images of the flower , girl and the abstract image , one   after another . We then asked them to tell us what first came into their mind when they saw   each image . 

 We then brought out the three different colors , red , blue and purple ; one after another and   asked them the same question as above . 

 After that , we brought out the first set of images combined with the three set of colors . We   brought out each image with the three colors as the background and asked them what the   best combination for a sanitary pad would be , and what they thought about the   combination . 

 Insight 

 From the described activities we were able to get the girls to really open up easily , share   and discuss their perspective of life from the images that we shared . Over and above getting   the insights that we required for coming up with the right packaging for the sanitary pads ,   we gathered a lot more than anticipated . We were able to understand their fears and   aspiration , dreams and wishes which would be helpful in future marketing strategies for the   sanitary pads . 

 Overall , the image of the girl and the color purple was the most preferred combination . The   girl was someone they could identify with and the color purple gave them confidence . The   abstract image said nothing to them , the image of the flower was more of what their   mothers would like , which they did not want to identify with . The color red was a turn off   for them in that they did not want to be constantly reminded that they are on their periods   just by looking at the package . The color blue to them was more masculine than feminine . 

 Approach 

 I observed that it is easier for people to open up when presented with a visual that they can react to   as opposed to asking open ended questions especially for very delicate topics ; in this case , the   menstrual health and hygiene . The initial approach of asking open ended questions would take   longer to gather insights as opposed to the visualization technique .

 Final Assignment 

 Made by : <NAME> <NAME> 

 Learning Launch 

 Challenge :    I am working I data analytic company as product manager . Due to the fact that we are   monetizing datasets we are always trying to find new ways of monetizing existing assets .   However , the main plan is to develop something that can be scalable internally as a products/   service but also a solution that can be scalable externally . One of our services is lead list/ b2b   selection services that provide our clients an exact list of potential clients to contact . In a   default way these lists are provided as hard copy lists in excel or some other legacy format .    We wanted to make one step further in our offer and provide to our clients not only list of   potential clients but also offer them a full - service product with capabilities to contact their   potential clients , online , contact them at social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn .      Selections :   We decided to focus on that project for 4 weeks . We gathered a small team of people coming   from different departments ( sales , IT , tech , product , customer care finance ) . We decided to   go with learning launch in order to get quick responses from the market/ clients . We wanted   to ran this project as agile process knowing that our main hypothesis -“Clients want to have   capability for micro targeting of their niche potential clients at social networks “ need to be   verified . We wanted to prove each step in our product delivery process in order to spent time   and resources in a good and meaningful way .     Application :    We divided our launch process into several iterations that are following Agile Manifesto . Each   iteration was limited to 1 - week period of time . 

 In 1st iteration we described in details existing situation in the market , needs from our 

 potential clients and options in front of them . To confirm these conclusions our sales team   member organized several meetings with clients and gathered their insights and feedbacks . 

 In the 2nd iteration we focused on insights that we got from clients and we started 

 detailing our concrete offer and added value that we will provide by our solution .   Team   members from tech and IT departments were keeping us inside possible framework while   sales once more took our final work and bring it in front of clients . That second approach   toward potential clients result in getting concrete feedback about solution , adjustments that   are needed , about also by doing that we got some test customers who were willing to try our   solution in practice .    During 3th iteration we prepared 1st prototype of our solution that was ready for using by our   test customers . For feedback gathering tool we used online survey and 1:1 questionnaire at 

 the end of test period while public recommendation and renewal of the service was some   kind of final “ test ” for providing added value to our customer .      Insights :    By applying <NAME> <NAME> tool , we managed to divide our project into small and testable   segments and each of these segments was crucial for deciding if we will proceed with our   product development process . Feedbacks and insights that were gathered in continuous way   helped us to be Agile and adjust our hypothesis to serve our clients in best way .    Although we confirmed our starting hypothesis , we faced many small but very important   adaptation how our solution is executing and how our clients are using it .      Approach :   This approach is very useful in product development processes because it puts clients as a   main stakeholder from the scratch . Having team members with different backgrounds in the   same team provides a good variety of understanding and thinking about same solution . Each   of team members brought useful knowledge into the team . Lack of prior knowledge is also   very important element because it brings you back to discuss some starting points that re   maybe already wrong .      Organization :   The team was organized as task force in which all team members were having same level   position . We established channels for convenient and easy communication between us while   all materials were shared inside team . Each day we had an online meeting ( scrum ) to check if   we are all at track or we should support some parts of the process in better , stronger way .    This project was out of focus for the rest of the company and during the whole period of time   no reporting toward high management was needed or executed .

"Reflection – Storytelling for In - Service Teacher Training Short Course 

 Challenge 

 I supervise a grassroots pre - service teacher training program for ethnic education teachers in rural   <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . Each year we train a cohort of young teachers in our 10 - month program , but   the reality is that our graduates make up just a small percentage ( under 10 % ) of the teachers working   in the ethnic education system in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . We are therefore exploring ways to reach   the many other teachers who lack pre - service teaching qualification by offering targeted in - service   support through teacher training short courses that can be delivered during the summer holiday . To   this end , we are preparing to pilot a 6 - week in - service teaching course for approximately 60 teachers   representing one of the six townships serviced by the ethnic education system . 

 The beneficiaries ( teachers ) come from disadvantaged , rural ethnic communities who teach a   combination of government curriculum and curriculum that has been developed by the   nongovernmental ethnic education provider . Their schools are under - resourced , although each child   typically has all required textbooks and is allowed to sit the government matriculation exam . Many   teachers are young , attending part - time university and female , and teaching is typically their first   professional experience . We realize that these teachers are largely unqualified and under - prepared for   the roles and responsibilities of teaching , and our short course aims to target a needed area of high   leverage growth to make them more comfortable , confident and successful in the classroom . 

 We are piloting this short course over a 6 - week period wherein teachers will be attending our class for   five hours a day , five days a week . The project is targeting approximately 60 teachers from one   township , although we are intending to scale the project to the remaining five townships in the region .   We are taking an iterative , agile approach wherein our training curricula can be modified as needed   during the initial pilot and the “ prototype ” curricula can then me modified as needed if we do scale it .   The project will be run by three full - time teacher trainers , and we will have access to part - time training   assistants who are graduates of our 10 - month pre - service teacher training course . Our staff will design   and implement the project . They are creative , confident , and have strong growth mindset . 

 Selection 

 For our first wave inspiration phase ( our research to answer the question what is to lead us to discuss   what if ) , we have brought aboard 10 field staff – teachers who are graduates of our pre - service   program – to help us conduct individual and group interviews for storytelling . We want to get a better   understanding of our beneficiaries ’ opinions of teaching , the challenges they face inside the classroom ,   and where and how their teaching profession exists in the grand scheme of their lives and the 

 communities they serve . We want to put the teachers at the center of our ideation , and believe that   having them share their personal teaching experience stories with us will best help us be empathetic to   their needs . 

 Application 

 We contacted our 10 field staff and prepared them to conduct interviews with the teachers that would   be attending our pilot training . These staff met with an average of six teachers individually and asked   them to reflect on three things : 

 1 ) What a workday in their life is like   2 ) What a non - workday in their life is like .   3 ) What the last several months have been life , using the following guiding questions if teacher 

 needed prompting : 

  What was your greatest 

 success ? 

  What was your 

 greatest challenge ? 

  What do you like the 

 most about your job ? 

  What are your core 

 values and habits ? 

  What would you like to 

 change the most about   your job / experience ? 

  Tell us about your 

 daily / weekly   schedule . 

  How do you like being 

 a teacher in this   community ? 

  What are your 

 greatest needs ? 

 The interviewers were instructed to listen and take objective notes , but were allowed to dive deeper   into answers if they needed more explanation or clarification , especially for the teacher to give his / her   perceived reason for a response . 

 We also wanted to get a better sense of how education is perceived by the students and their parents .   Each interviewer therefore also surveyed one neighborhood in each village in the township through a   group interview with students and their parents . Although we had to do group interviews for the sake   of time , there was good participation and our interviewers were able to ask these key stakeholders the   pertinent questions “ what role does the school currently play in your life ? ” and “ what role do you want   the school to play in your life ? ” . 

 Insight 

 Our research process gave a voice to our projects ’ participants and stakeholders . We learned a great   deal from our research , which better helped us identify several “ themes ” to address in our short   course . These themes were : 

 1 . Teachers feel a great sense of pride in their titles , but also combat dismay that their teaching is 

 not more fun for their students 

 2 . Teachers are engaged when they are at the school , but tend to disengage with their 

 professional responsibilities when their workday is over 

 3 . Teachers feel stress because of their time workload inside the classroom ( teaching up to 6 

 lessons each day ) and outside ( cooking , cleaning and washing clothes for their parents or   families ) ; therefore teachers do not have ample time to sit down and prepare for their lessons 

 4 . Teachers choose to use poor teaching methods ( ie reading by heart / rote - memorization ) not 

 because they think they are appropriate , but because they are so familiar and easy to prepare 

 5 . Students are motivated to have fun in class and be with their friends ( not so much to learn new 

 material or become experts ) 

 6 . Some students would choose to leave school if given the opportunity because they do not like 

 being bored during their lessons 

 7 . Students parents value education abstractly and as a child - care opportunity , but many parents 

 mentioned that their children rarely mention their experiences at school when they come   home 

 Hearing stories from the teachers , students and parents opened our eyes to the realities these   beneficiaries ( teachers ) and stakeholders ( students and parents ) face in their communities , and the   place education has within these realities . It helped us engage on a more personal level with the   groups we are aiming to help , and it was additionally beneficial because we had members of the   governing education body sit in and observe many of the interviews . They admitted that they had   never taken such a human - centered approach before , and that they learned a lot about the   experiences , opinions and emotions of the people their education system employs and serves .   Personally , many of the themes highlighted in the interviews were anticipated , but it was great to have   documented stories that share a strong , often common narrative as these could be very persuasive to   policy developers and international donors . Moreover , those who were interviewed were appreciative   of us “ lending an ear ” and listening attentively , and they all showed an eagerness to participate further   in our project , be it as a participant ( teacher ) or feedback provided ( students , parents ) during our   monitoring and evaluation process . 

 To conclude , during ideation our team went back to our framed design challenge and decided to   develop a short course training focusing on textbook adaptation such that each lesson incorporated a   learning objective “ reveal ” and activity that would surprise and excite the students . We introduced a   collection of activities easily applied to the textbooks ( thereby saving teachers planning time ) as well as   ways to let students create learning materials that would be shareable to their family . We have   developed a framework and are preparing to implement the prototype in the coming months , at which   time we will take feedback from participants and later from students and parents . Therefore , for us the   next stage would be a learning launch to test what we have developed in ideation and how it works   with those we have developed it for . 

 Approach 

 Using interviews ( individual and group ) to inspire innovation through storytelling was time intensive   and human resource intensive , and although it was extremely valuable , it might not be replicable with   the remaining five townships due to time and resource constraints . However , we still want to research   the needs of the teachers in the remaining townships before designing and implementing their own in- service teacher training short courses , and I think our team will use mind mapping for research in our   next township . We have gathered a lot of information from our initial interviews and storytelling and   we will present a lot of this information ( successes , challenges , emotions , needs , wants , regrets ,   values ) via sticky note to a focus group of our future stakeholders . They will then be able to organize   them according to their own personal experiences , expectations , et al , and from there we will have   created a graphic mind map of education ’s place in their lives and their community . We can do this   through a town - hall style meeting with stakeholders , and this will potentially save us quite a lot of time   as we hope to iterate our previously designed short course for targeted in - service teacher training   short courses for the remaining five townships .

"Story Telling Tool 

 Challenge   I work at a Mining Research company which employees mostly engineers and scientists .   These are analytical thinkers who approach most projects with scientific method and where   people typically speak in facts and figures . We employ the traditional "" technology push ""   approach where research into the unknown results in a new invention , and we then try to   find a need for that invention . One of our objectives is community upliftment where a   struggling rural community is targeted for upliftment . The execution of these types of   projects has been largely clinical in nature . First , a method of upliftment is selected , and this   can include options such as training in jewellery manufacturing , ornament design , etc . Then   the project is executed . The challenge is that we have not taken the time to properly engage   with the community to determine their needs . And where we have had success , we have   found it difficult to relay the importance of the work to other stakeholders .     Selection   I have selected the Story Telling Tool from the Design Thinking Toolkit to apply to this   challenge . This tool was introduced to us by <NAME> <NAME> in week 2 of the lectures .   It helps you convey emotions , connections and the larger purpose , instead of just facts and   figures or a checklist . <NAME> mentioned that the story helps create a cause . People are   looking to be inspired , and this tool can be a powerful for that purpose .     Application   To begin with , we have to understand the community we were trying to help and what their   real problems are . We should avoid coming up with solutions without first really   understanding the problem . To try to achieve this we have started interviewing members of   the community . We ask open ended questions about their personal circumstances and what   their goals are . We found that even the little training that we had implemented was making   a difference in their lives .     We have begun sharing the stories of these community members with some of the   stakeholders . Instead of boring Power Point presentations , we now have personal stories of   people ’s expectations from our projects and the impact of the projects on their lives . We   have learnt to structure our stories carefully , depending on the target audience e.g. the   technical people require much more detail .     Insights   We realized that facts and figures were only part of the equation . The humanness of the   problem must be captured in order to elicit the responses we need to help solve the   underlying problems and storytelling turns out to be the perfect tool for this . We also   realized that these stories we had already shared meant something to everyone who   worked at the company . The tool helps motivate people and aligns them with a greater   purpose . It had created a cause that we could use to rally more support .     Approach 

 The way that we perform research needs to be balanced . Instead of trying to push an   invention to market , sometimes it is necessary to determine what people actually need first ,   this can then guide the research . Those are the principles of Design Thinking , but has not   been the approach we have used in my company in the past . As part of an innovation team   at my organization , I have plans to run Design Thinking workshops and training sessions so   that the needs of the people play a vital role early on in any new development .

"Design Thinking for innovation final reflection 

 The Challenge : 

 The challenge I have currently been facing has been which graduate school and program   will be the best for me to apply to in the fall . I hold a BFA in Dramatic Arts and my   emphasis was costume design . I have designed shows professionally as an independent   artist , and have also designed and made boutique children ’s clothing . I never thought of   it this way , but realize much later that I have been a practicing entrepreneur for many   years . We are coming into an age where social , lifestyle , and arts entrepreneurial   businesses are thriving and it makes me so very excited . My plan is to combine my arts   background with entrepreneurship for researching and teaching . 

 The Selection : 

 As I reflected on the lectures and design tools , the Visualization Tool from the first   module struck the right chord with me . <NAME> defined the tool as one that   “ makes the idea tangible and concrete , taking it beyond words along . ” I know that I am a   visual learner , and I absolutely like when things are tangible , so this seemed the perfect   tool to use . My goal was to get all the thoughts , research ideas , possible minors , and   pretty much everything that inspires me down on paper and try to steer it all into a   cohesive direction . 

 The Application : 

 I began by listing my repertoire . I chose to organize my talents and attributes into three   categories : Career , Personal , and Family . Seeing it down on paper affected me   profoundly . I come from an abusive childhood ( all types , unfortunately ) and self - esteem   has been something I struggle with even decades later . After the repertoire , I made out   ( lots ! ) of sticky notes with all of the things that stir me , that inspire creativity in me , and   that intrigue me about the fields of arts and business . Matching some of them up with   my repertoire brought the realization that I really did have tangible experience that I   could share , teach , and build upon . Finally , I took the “ anything ’s possible ” outlook and   narrowed the schools down to about 8 top choices . For each , I listed as many pro ’s and   con ’s as I could think of , and matched up my interests with each program ’s faculty   specialties and research . In the end , the University of Manchester looks like a clear winner . 

 The Insight : 

 The Design Thinking course has flexed my brain in so many ways . I am happy to look at   and approach problems in new ways . It would seem I took this course at just the right   time , for the tools feel like a cohesion that has brought my thoughts about graduate   school into focus . It also has opened up another interest for me that I would like to   pursue while in graduate school , and perhaps teach after graduate school . The   Visualization Tool felt like putting together a jigsaw puzzle that does n’t show you a   finished picture . I did n’t know what the picture would look like , I just knew I had all 

 these pieces and that they fit together somehow . Visualization gave me the finished   picture . 

 The <NAME> : 

 I do n’t think I would choose to use another tool for this particular challenge . It really felt   like the best fit for the project . If I repeated the process , I might organize it not by   school , but by academician and their respective fields , just to see the result that would   bring . In the end , however , it will come down to the fit of the faculty , the school itself ,   and the location .

 Reflection – 

 Our Learning Launch Challenge 

 Challenge : I am a High School English Department Chair . Our challenge is to review and   potentially replace literary texts that we suspect are not connecting with our students . This is a   key part of our English curriculum and we want to provide the most engaging texts for optimum   learning .   We are ten English teachers with 1200 students . The key stakeholders are , of course ,   the students . However , we teachers , as the ‘ experts ’ also feel that students should be exposed   to certain texts , but this may be biased by our love of literature and penchant for the classics .   We would like to focus our research on what the students , teachers , and administration see as   the key criteria for our literary texts in order to make thoroughly informed curricular choices . If   we do find a solution to our perceived problem , this would require a syllabus review for each   grade level . This would involve much work , but no cost . ( Our students purchase their own   literary texts or we use online versions in the public domain . ) 

 Selection : We are an innovative school and are therefore familiar with the design process , but   the Learning Launch method ( as explained in <NAME> <NAME> ’s video ) seemed to be the best way to   get a plethora of ideas ( or a snapshot of stakeholder thoughts ) in order to make an informed   decision about our curriculum . It meant we could quickly test or survey the school   community — we want to establish what ’s out there and not simply assume that we always   know best when it comes to providing learning resources and opportunities 

 Application : Our first challenge was to work as a department to identify and test our   assumption that our texts do not always work ; we would then work to see if a review is needed .   We met as a department to brainstorm and also invited an administrator ( to act as the ‘ skeptic ’   <NAME> recommends in his video ) to counter our confirmation bias . This kept us balanced . For   our first learning launch meeting we listed all our literary texts and gave brief ‘ gut ’ feedback on   whether we should keep or discard the texts . We also kept a separate list of texts to add to our   program if needed . We saw what we thought was a need for change . We realized that this was   not really ‘ hard ’ data , however , and therefore decided to get a survey snapshot of stakeholder   thoughts in bulk , rather than a collection of opinions . This survey involved students from each   grade level and teachers to test our assumption and reach the truth . For example , we asked   students to identify their favorite texts in each course and give other feedback , for example ,   how appropriate they perceived the texts to be ( see partial data below ) . 

 Insight : The data informed us that our assumption was partly correct . Students are mixed about   their responses to the literature . What was clear , however , was that a sufficient number of   students ( even our most outstanding students ) would like to see a review of our texts . The   department plans to spend a session to consider each of our texts to assess worth . Based on   survey results and a number of concerns that not enough classic British and American literature   was occurring at the lower grade levels , we will work through each course to reassess the texts   and align them with our learning standards and students ’ development . This is still a work in   progress ; we have many courses and many teaching personalities ! The learning launch tool   helped us to get together to establish our assumptions and find ways to test or challenge them   with data from the community . Our assumption was only partially correct , but the data we   received helped to use what we had learned to effect a change for the benefits of our students . 

 Approach : Although we are already familiar with the mind - mapping tool of the design process ,   the learning launch was definitely the best tool for this situation . In this way , we got many ,   many ideas from more sources , rather than simply brainstorming the value ( or lack thereof ) of   our current literary texts . This was a quick and easy way to test our assumption and make   informed confident decisions in the best interests of our students .

"Challenge : Orphan Disease or Rare Disease is a condition that affects a small percentage of the nation ’s   population . In the US , rare disease is any disease or conditions that affects fewer than 200,000 people in   the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . The specific challenge I have encountered is that most solutions may not address the   needs of patients with rare disease . Specifically , I am interested in understanding the patients challenge   when they have a rare disease and I would like be study patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension   ( PAH ) . About 20 % of patients with this disease require continuous infusion of medication 24x7x365 days   a year using through a small infusion pump . In these patients , they have about 2 - 3 hours maximum   where they can be without the drug after which the impact is fatal . But with the medication the patient   can lead a normal life . I am interested in creating App that will help the patient manage their disease . In   managing rare disease , in addition to the patients there are three other stakeholders who are also key in   managing the patient ’s disease conditions – 

 ( 1 ) Healthcare Professionals : Physicians and Nurses   ( 2 ) Pharmaceutical companies who provide the medications and usually have a patient support 

 program 

 ( 3 ) Caregiver – usually someone in the patient ’s family . 

 I am planning to use Visualization – specially <NAME> <NAME> to understand the patients journey in   managing the disease and their various challenges as well as what they key issues are faced by   Healthcare professionals and Caregivers . For this project , I am not including the pharmaceutical   companies . 

 Selection : In order to understand the essential experiences of the 3 stakeholders – patients , healthcare   professionals and caregiver , I will use Journey mapping to understand each of the stakeholder   perspectives and explore what challenges are common and what challenges are specific to each   stakeholder 

 Journey mapping will help us visualize how each stakeholder ’s experiences of managing the disease and   what a tool must do to address the core needs of each of them . 

 Application : I plan to conduct the journey mapping study by following the concepts of ethnographic   principles to understand the journey of each of the stakeholder as they manage the disease . I plan to   interview each of the stakeholder as well as spend time observing them in their environment to   understand what the current process is and get insights into their challenges . The objective is to arrive   at issues & concerns that are common for all stakeholders and issues / concerns that are unique to each   stakeholder . The objective is to catalog is information and to help design a tool that will integrate and   help all stakeholders to manage the disease . 

 Insight and <NAME> : The Design Thinking course has provided me with tools to approach a problem in   real life that I am facing . While various tools are available , I believe the use of Journey mapping will   provide insights into disease management journey of each stakeholder .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I am an animation student and I am working on different projects and illustrations . My challenge for now   is to improve my workflow and concentration spawn in order to increase the quality of my projects and   decrease time spent on work . I will focus on trying to uncover what I consider to be effective or   problematic with regard to my workflow . I have used the technique of using a visualization of my schedule   and projects descriptions , domain with a set of questions to allow a diverse group of my friends to help   defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when   identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Selection 

 The tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve clear understanding of my   problem space among a diverse group of people and me before attempting to identify and define possible   solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with myself , working on my animations and   commissions . I has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools , so I think I am ready to   try the Visualization tool for this task . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating an approximate image of the problem domain . To develop this , I will draw   graphic from any existing material available to understand my environment . The existing material may be   my grades during different approaches and environment , training materials and my observations on my   mental and physical health . 

 The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Time and Value and a column on   the right to identify Quality , such university grades , my expectations , feelings , my friends ’ opinion , and   other entities that may add constraints to how I work . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple   shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work ,   then I will create a different type of visual , either based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for   different stakeholders , or another format . 

 For the activity , I will make a group of 5 - 6 participants each representing a different area of interest . Each   participant receives a poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly , or use   sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements   are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately   reflect problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities in   your problem space ? I give them approximately 10 minutes to discuss the questions together with me   and mark up the graphic . Then I have each their report out on their answers to those three questions   while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As they report out , I record commonalities in the insights ,   and then additional insights that come from me . After the session , I digitize combined poster as an artifact ,   create a view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a   renewed graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from carrying this exercise with several participants is that while the graphic –   especially the renewed graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing my   understanding of the problem I am working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the shared   insights and shared learning that occurs while I am working to define my problem space . The graphic gives   the diverse group of participants a valid point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectives   and develop insights into potential root causes of my problems . While I could create the graphic from a 

 blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a image jump starts the conversation for them . They   can quickly identify where they are in the graphic and can more quickly gain new insights about   relationships between key entities instead of taking time to identify them . I can also identify variables in   the problem space , it helps me to identify what I do n’t know , in what areas I need to obtain information   or skill to provide the values for the variables . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would use   the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities .

"REFLECTION - MINDMAP 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Mind mapping is more functional and an efficient tool for me to use it as a problem solving method and also as a tool for helping me develop prototype ideas virtually or practically . Mind map has helped me and my team to develop so many ideas rather it has helped us proposing the ideas to the IDEA LAB of our university . As techies we need to map various possibilities while developing a solution or a product in the initial stages . We spend a lot of time evaluating our ideas or mind mapping the various ideas or key points that are always favoured as a team . For me personally , leading the team means that I should always be all ears to the each and every member , be it the control guy , marketing guy or the statistics / logistics guy . 

 So we mind map everything . Even the smallest allegation that would defame our idea . I not only review the mind map , but I too invite industry experts in the specific field to view the mind map . We know that even two different members of a team working in the same environment would have the same mind set or the think in the same direction . So as to get a third person view , mind mapping helps in people to search for a flaw or an advantage quite easily . Reviewing the mind map is like you have everything about your solution in a complete nutshell . 

 Application 

 After improving my knowledge on mind maps ( as a tool ) through this course I tried implementing it in one of our solutions for a Tech - o - thon tournament where solutions for better & easy life post Covid’19 were to be presented . So the first and the initial step I took was a third person view . I surveyed various family members of the Covid’19 patients or the recovered patients as well . So the main idea I focused on was automation that would be a safety measure for the coming challenges . I thought there is no better option than mind mapping the points . If they did it by themselves would help them brain storm in a better way . I took some sample questionnaire regarding the problems they faced and they think that the human race will have to face . Different mind maps on the their types were developed . I bifurcated mind maps on basis of Problems , Solutions , Possibilities & Poll . Poll was a type of mind map where the different people gave their percentage success for the planned solution . I reviewed people ’s different mind maps . Learning how far they can think I was able to extract major areas which needed to be innovated . The solution currently in the society were not a direct help to the survivors . I used mind map and tried to find out the common problems faced . 

 Insight & Approach 

 So initially people were only given basic information . Step by step the quality of mind mapping improved . I used three level guiding system . Where in the initial level , without any debriefing people were told to mind map anything they felt <ADDRESS> has done or will do in future , be it socially , economically or personally . I evaluated their mind maps into mine and the results I found were quite generalized one . For the next level they were briefed and I focused basically on their treatment & how the system works with minimum number of workers required for their treatment endangering themselves . For the third level , I proposed a point that proved to be a major breakthrough for our innovation . That point was a consequence of overlapping mind maps of the second level . That is how breaking the mind mapping tool into various small mind maps proved to be quite effective among all the other design thinking tools as far as my understanding is concerned . This method has helped me achieve a far more better approach while developing solutions .

"Challenge : I am working as COO with a Telecom Infrastructure company , in the state of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> in   the <ADDRESS> side of <ADDRESS> . This part of <ADDRESS> is prone to inclement weather for large part of the year almost 8- 9 months . The Field force or the Technicians that mange our 11000 cell sites , spread over a large area ,   90 Thousand Sq . <NAME> . It is a hard task , as our customer the “ Telecom Service Providers ” are   sensitive to outages and the end consumers , who want to be connected to Mobile Network always . The   biggest issue is the power supply which disappears as soon as rain starts , and we must keep running the   network with DGs and Batteries . Fuel replenishment also is major task due to long power cuts and road   blockages , uprooting of trees , bad terrain etc . This leads to burn out , exhaustion and safety risk above   all . 

 Each Year after the weather settle downs , we use to randomly select good performers based on output   parameters and conduct some award ceremony and handover few gifts . 

 The Challenge is to Keep the Field Force motivated and also ensure Safety these people who have to   face all kind of adversity to keep the Mobile Network up and running 24 * 7 , 365 days an year . 

 Selection : We did ethnographic analysis and used journey mapping tools to gather data , finally   understood that there was lack of sense of belonging to the organization overall and all the   communication that was originating from Top was lost in the journey almost completely . They doubted   the intent of organization being really concerned about their safety , and felt organization was only using   them to keep the network running . We finally selected ” <NAME> <NAME> ” a way to communicate a new   compressive Reward & Recognition Program with a strong Emphasis on Safety . This Tool was selected   because we were addressing a large audience , they were technicians ( field personnel ) they lacked   connect and messages given to them in isolation was not resonating with them . Therefore , to get them   at one place along with their families helped us to bond with them . Complete R&R Program and Safety   Message was communicated by a Circle Leadership Team Member using Audio / Visual and a Scripted   story Line for Effective and Consistent message with Credibility . We kind of used <NAME> <NAME> example   to address this issue in a comprehensive way . 

 Application : A detailed score card - based evaluation criteria was identified with strong emphasis on   Proactive maintenance of <NAME> , Fuel availability and Logistics management . Safety was also addressed   comprehensively with Risk Awareness , Prevention and Elimination components .   The Program was   called “ Parakaram ” which in English means Valor or Bravery . 

 Insight : It is important to understand people who are recipient of your communication , because often ,   the message what organization and leadership from Top wants to communicate is diluted as it travels   down to the last mile . It is therefore , important that the key messages and information is directly given   to the concern audience by leaders themselves . Best place to connect to people is also their work place ,   shop floor or at their sites . <NAME> <NAME> is effective communication tool to convey important message   and is retained for a long time . 

 Approach : Identifying problem without jumping to problem solving is challenging task at starting ,   especially for people with many years of experience . Therefore , using design thinking tools such as   journey mapping , visualization help , “ What is ” and “ What If ” are key phases and time must be spent   there .   We used these to understand the real issues and used <NAME> <NAME> as a Tool to effectively   communicate the organizational message and program .

"Challenge & Selection      Design thinking is a tool to leaders to motivate and inspire their employees   towards creating new skills , innovation and creating a connection between them   which will help the organizations to grow faster . I have often met people of   different ages , they are going through stress and loneliness , might be because   different reasons they are going through . However I get time and opportunity , try   to mingle with such group of known people not for sake of solving problems but   for at least talking to them and making peace of mind . This has also helped me in   realizing the strength and capabilities of mine to understand people and help   them to deal with problems somewhere to some extent . Therefore I use stories in   a discussion with person , which help me to get them to pay attention , a bit longer   and hence increase the level of engagement , which in turn is very beneficial to   achieve results .      Application      Here come experiences to share of my event in the company , where I had a role   to play something innovative way , think out of the box and organize something   different and unique , in this competition as suggested by senior ’s management . In   this event , I was addressing the audience and was trying to present a case study ; I   tried to explain using incidents and past experience in the form of a story . The   case study was about how differently and various ways can be used in order to   improve the Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) in any organization . After I   started interacting with audiences with few questions I realized , I bought some   time and allowed to get them pay attention for longer time . The level of   engagement over there was more . Session was about how I tried to help   physically handicapped patients to live their life positively and how they can enjoy   their life with their loved ones by doing different things . I did a presentation in   front of doctors and their collogue with few chief guests by explaining how the   multiple ways which can be used for physically handicapped patients and more   energetic and hence giving them strength to fight spend with life in peaceful   manners . This was the initiative taken by our company to do something as a part   of CSR activity for <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> Sanstha(NGO ) . I had prepared few games for   them , might help them to spend their time in a meaningful way and also   encouraged them to have more of healthy food . After the presentation , I made a 

 comfortable talk with few patients in their room there I found one women sitting   quietly and was quite depression . I found that she need attention so I went near   her and spoke . She opened up to me and said he who painful her life with this   disability . 

 Insight & Approach      At the end of the conversation , could sense fear and pain from which she was   going through . However I realized to open up to her and share my story . I shared   the story regarding my cousin brother when he lost legs and physically   handicapped   in the car accident in the age of 24 and how scary it was after   seeing in such a manner in so young age   and taking him   to the hospitals for   checkups and treatment . It was a long process though , I also shared with her , that   but instead of that also explained everyone present there how he managed his   life without bothering any one and spend their life with their families and loved   ones I also told her that our families both were in the same situation I also   conveys her that self beliefs and confident are one of things which helps to come   from this trauma . This experiences sharing worked well really . It was hour for   someone to hear her out support . At last she calmed down and found a ray of   hope . This gave me satisfaction that finally it helped someone to come out of   pain .    So therefore I told this story in the event , to the audience and yes I do feel that it   had an impact on them . Sometimes storytelling allows you to create energy ,   passion and excitement around , making things simple and relatable . It increases   the engagement between two people .    Altogether this course gave an opportunity to understand the concept of various   design thinking tools used , and the application of applying it in relatable   situations . Also I am glad to share that now I can make stories way ahead and use   them in situations whenever and wherever required and also it has helped me a   lot to present my thoughts and different ideas . At the end , videos which are given   in this course , depicting live and practical examples were very helpful .

"Challenge :   I remember one of the first projects I ever worked on as a consultant in an HR consultancy firm ,   whereby our challenge was to increase employee satisfaction and efficiency , adding value to the   company as a professional organization . The vision of our project was to create an efficient employee   management system whereby we could translate it to any organization witnessing low - levels of   employees ’ satisfaction . My team and I , a group of 5 young experts in the field , truly believed that   customer approval of any company can only be achieved through high employee satisfaction and   fulfillment .     Selection :   We decided to use design thinking in order to achieve our aim , and we chose to use the learning launch   tool . By definition , the learning launch tool is about making small , quick and smart experiences in order   to test our hypothesis . Our testing ground was an 8 - year old well - established real estate development   company , facing several customer issues as well as various employee problems . The project was limited   to internal resources ( Financial and HR ) . As we had multiple ideas generated from different brain   storming sessions , we decided that the learning launch tool was a good outfit to the situation .      Application :   On one hand , we preceded every learning launch by various interviews with employees and surveys   ranking different aspects of the work nature and environment present in the company . And on the other   hand , we tracked the progress by noting the differences between answers given by employees to   numerous objective and subjective questions , before and after the learn launch . We divided employee   satisfaction levels into three different sectors ( Personal , Social and Financial ) , and worked on improving   each sector at a time , in order to finalize a model whereby all sectors were optimized , according to   employees .     For our first learning launch , after we evaluated the Personal Sector as being the most important , we   focused on the work space of each employee – how it was decorated , where it was located , degrees of   privacy / transparency , amenities in the office ( for breaks ) , cubicle / desk settings ( confortable seating , low   visual pollution ) , etc … We devised a plan whereby we introduced or changed each item at a time , in   order to track the impact and keep the motion and anticipation levels high . These smart changes as we   like to call them , had a tremendous impact on employee satisfaction which brought us to our second   sector , socializing .     Our second learning launch focused on social needs of employees in the workplace and how it affected   their behavior and efficiency . Thus , we introduced free online collaborative softwares , whereby all   employees working on a similar project , could keep track , update and get further involvement in the   project itself . This created more efficiency in the work and supplemented employees with social   interactions . In addition we introduced a social plan of monthly outdoor activities , whereby we praised   and practiced team work , in order to strengthen the bond and create long - term relationships . 

 Our third and final learning launch focused on the financial aspect of the work , a process which was   poorly respected and managed by senior - level managers and directors . We introduced a new award   system of project - related micro - bonuses and micro - raises on a monthly basis rather than yearly basis .   The fast pace of this system was the reason of increase in efficiency during work - hours . Employees were   more serious and respectful of the new award system and the workflow as it is .     Insight :   The learning launch tool helped us test various assumptions we had about improving employee   satisfaction and helped us test our hypothesis in a quick effective method . The flow of data we gathered   was paramount in our evaluation of each designed learning launch . Furthermore , we kept using these   designs for months , testing the correlation between employee and customer satisfactions , assuming   high association between both . Our results were not completely as expected , as little connection was   accurately proved . However , we did see increases in customer satisfaction from the professional , yet   relaxing and positive environment that is now existing and emanating from employees . Innovative ideas   using design thinking was very helpful in helping and developing efficiency in employees , on a personal   and professional level .     Approach :   Our team used this design thinking tool in a very keen way , resourcing and developing our insight   further , applying it to different industries . Moving forward we might apply these designs on a broader   basis ( designing learn launches uniquely to the various departments ) , testing several methods and   systems into finally creating a unique long - term solution : fashioning the relationship between   employees and customers on one hand , and employees , customers and organization on the other .   Future launch designs should come closer to a full solution on this matter .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge : 

 The challenge that I selected for this assignment was to plan , develop , and release a 

 promotional marketing video for a target audience in our industry . We were assigned a time period of   30 days to complete this challenge . This video was the first of 4 videos released throughout the year   ( one per quarter ) that will market this topic to our audience . The project scope consisted of a 4 - person   marketing department team and an additional 6 - person department composed of subject matter   experts relating to the actual content that the video is marketing . The cost of producing the video did   not include any external key stakeholders and no vendors were used since the entirety of the   production efforts were being done in - house . 

 Selection : 

 The marketing team came up with several different iterations of how to execute this idea before 

 deciding on a promotional video . This video was the first of 4 videos that were launched throughout the   year . We adapted the strategies and approach we used to develop the remaining 3 videos based upon   the feedback of the first launch , which is why we decided to use a Learning Launch . A Learning Launch ,   used to test the validity of an idea or prototype , was ideal in this situation because we used the first   promotional video to test our ideas with a real , live audience and measure the reception that it   received . 

 Application : 

 In the Learning Launch of the first video , we focused on presenting our audience with an 

 animated promotional video for a variety of reasons . The first reason was that it was a great way to   reduce the project costs , since our organization already had animation programs installed on its   computers and we had employees who knew how to develop the content that we wanted . The second   was that we wanted to present our audience with a unique video that they would remember , and   animation seemed like a great way to accomplish that goal . If this video style was not well received by   our audience , we developed contingency plans to ensure the future success of the marketing campaign   throughout the remainder of the year . 

 <NAME> , the learning launch was a success thanks to effective application by the team and 

 the first video that we released was deemed a success by the management of our organization . Despite   taking some risks on the aesthetics of the video , the feedback that we gathered from our target   audience indicated that the video made an impression on them and that our message was being   delivered effectively . 

 Insight : 

 Following the release of our marketing video , the response that we received was 

 overwhelmingly positive . Our organization took a calculated risk by deciding to produce and deliver a   video in a medium that we had little experience in , and it paid off well for us . Through this Learning   Launch we discovered more about our target customer and core audience , and we are now poised to   use the information that we ’ve uncovered to continue making impactful and meaningful engagements   with our customer base . The insight that we gained from this experience has taught us that often it 

 becomes necessary to stray away from traditional methods and strategies in order to stand out in an   increasingly crowded market . 

 Approach : 

 Taking the inexperience that our team had in this area at the beginning of the project , a 

 Learning Launch stood out as the clear tool to help us accomplish our goals . While we were fortunate to   achieve our goals in the first iteration of the video , the Learning Launch would have proven its   usefulness even more had we not by offering the knowledge necessary to get the project back on track   in order to become a success . Future launches will benefit from the feedback and experience that we   gathered in this project and will enhance the production timelines for videos that our organization   releases later .

"Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge : 

 When working in research , at the beginning of any project it is required to have clear ideas about   the topic to be carried out . Especially when working in a group , where each one , with their   experience , provides options for a project . Then it is necessary to understand and try to choose   a specific topic and focus our ideas towards the same point in order to carry out the initial idea .   The challenge is precisely this , to bring together the entire working group and , together , to   propose and choose the topic that will be developed during the project that begins . 

 Selection : 

 In this case , the tool I have chosen is the mind map since it allows the organization of ideas ,   taking into account patterns and perspectives , as mentioned in module 3 . With mind maps it is   possible to take the ideas of all group participants and organize them in such a way that you   have a clear idea of the options available . 

 Application : 

 In the case of the beginning of the planning of a project , the use of a mind map was quite useful   since , being a diverse group and each person with their own idea and theme , the map allowed   to organize all the ideas , put them in agreement to a topic , group them and then , among all the   participants , choose based on different criteria which one was convenient to continue to the   next stage . So , once the ideal theme was had , it was possible to start planning the rest of the   project , based on the map made . 

 Insight : 

 In this case , the use of a mind map is adequate to organize the different ideas that the people   who make up a work group have . In this way , each person participates actively and is able to   make their opinion known . In addition , it was useful for the challenge of starting a collaborative   project because the ideas were raised clearly and without limitations , helping to have different   points of view that helped to expand the repertoire of ideas and see which of them could be   more innovative . 

 Approach : 

 Although the mind map was a good decision for this challenge , the visualization tool could also   be applied since it allows to have a greater understanding of the ideas of each participant and   in this way to be able to solve the problem posed , visual thinking is , so to speak , the way to see   in a more direct and tangible way what another person thinks .

"Design Thinking for CRM re – implementation at my current organization 

 Design Thinking Tool Used : Visualization 

 Challenge : 

 After a failed attempt of CRM ( Customer relationship Management ) implementation & adoption for   the sales team at my present organization , we took the task to take insights from the failed attempt   and run the project with necessary measures to ensure successful adoption within the organization . 

 We chose <NAME> <NAME> for the team of 45 members of <ADDRESS> , NPRD , Customer Service and   Management help us overcome the challenges of productivity , transparency , motivation and 

 improved sense of achievement . In the 1st phase , we did try and automate most parts of our sales ,   project and customer communications cycle but failed to achieve the desired adoption due to   technical glitches , resistance by the users for the change , . 

 Having spent enough on getting the new tool implemented in addition to the recurring cost of   license fees without actual utilization , it was difficult to convince the management to get a new 

 partner onboard to complete implementation and help drive adoption , due to the earlier failed   attempt . The message from the management was clear to agree on the project “ We can not afford   to fail again ” 

 Selection : 

 From the past learning , we decided to go ahead with learning launch to identify the requirements ,   possible risks and their mitigation plan . During the process , we also would be able to identify the   challenges faced by the users and plan to help drive the adoption 

 Application & Insight : 

 To analyze the reasons of failure , we conducted quick meetings with the stakeholders similar to the 

 examples cited in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . We used the visualization tool to identify the   opportunities to identify the best solution to our current problems . The outcome of the same would   help us in designing the solution as well as method to implement the solution . Below listed are the   major outcomes of the exercise . 

 1 . Expected Page Layouts were created .    2 . Excess Data entry points were identified for elimination in the new design 

 3 . Links were established with the other modules in the overall process   4 . <NAME> <NAME> was created for the tech team to start working on the technical design   5 . Data Model Correction required was identified at different points   6 . Data Accessibility and Restrictions were identified for each role / function 

 7 . Consensus was built with the stakeholders on the design and page layouts . 

 By the end of the exercise , we were clear on the way forward to the design . Since the exercise had   all the relevant stakeholders involvement , we were sure of having a better success ratio of the   project who would really understand the importance of the project and benefits it would extend to   them . 

 We also agreed on using learning launch tool as an outcome of visualization to develop few   modules , test , fix and then proceed to next module instead of a one - time launch of the package   which required higher commitment of resources and time . 

 Approach : 

 With the gained insights , we will ensure that before starting any key projects , we use the design   thinking tools to map the requirements with the help of the stakeholders and use the learning launch   phase to gather insights and opportunities of improvement . This would ensure a higher success ratio   of attempted innovations in the organizational requirements .

"DESIGN THINKING COURSE    FINAL ASSIGNMENT - <NAME> <NAME>    STORYTELLING 

 Challenge 

 Coursera ’s Design Thinking course made me acknowledge a useful and proven process for 

 the creation of innovative ideas . I will try to apply learned concepts and tools in my presales 

 role at work . Some of the tools such as visualization and storytelling were already in use in 

 my role , although I now have a better background to apply them more efficiently within the 

 design thinking process , defining the “ What is ” , “ What if ” , “ What wows ” and “ What Works ” . 

 Storytelling for technical presales 

 In LATAM ( <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ) , customers with IT ( Information Technology ) requirements are 

 usually overwhelmed with many solutions to be analyzed for their needs . Comparing those 

 solutions may become a very big effort for customers and vendors . Features may not be 

 standardized , and business processes may require customization or a combination of two 

 or more technologies to cover a specific need . 

 <NAME> is very useful for technical presales in IT . As a presales engineer , this tool allows 

 me to : 

 ● Share stories of other experiences or other success cases with customers . 

 ● Discover many issues and opportunities in customer ’s organizations ( corporations , 

 government agencies , etc ) . 

 ● Show that the project I sell can comply with customer ’s needs . 

 Insight - Applying Storytelling for presales engineering 

 While customers listen to the stories I share , I also ask them to share their own problems 

 and opportunities for their business . I use that feedback to design a preliminary solution 

 that will then evolve into a successful project . The way to evolve is through an agile 

 methodology . So , we iterate in the definition of the solution as many times as we need , in 

 order to define an efficient solution that complies with each other 's interests and goals . 

 The solution becomes our solution ( not only mine or the customer ’s ) . 

 I collect the information discovered in every step , plus the context information of 

 specialized sites ( including public competition information ) to develop strategies to 

 improve the chances of a winning solution . 

 Approach - Conclusion 

 I can now use storytelling in a more efficient way , and complement with the other tools 

 explained in the Design Thinking course in workshops with my customers . 

 Thanks a lot to <NAME> <NAME> and her team !

"Self Acceptance 

 Tool used : Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I spend a major part of my time on research in any design or photography project to   empathize with the stakeholders involved . And to do that I often use storytelling as a tool to   bond with the people which most of the times helps them identify their real problem and   then they work around it . One such example is about a friend of mine who is not familiar to   design thinking ; she had a very restricted and a worry - some approach towards life and   herself , like she does n’t like herself mentally or physically . One of the major concerns   according to her was of her being overweight . 

 Application 

 So I happen to be a lean & thin guy , and hence I started with a story of my own , that how I   too had similar thoughts due to my physical appearance and how overtime I evolved and   got over that stage of feeling lonely and worrying for every other thing . I told her that how a   simple act of acceptance of myself , that whatever I am is enough and with that I can do a   lot . 

 Insight 

 After listening to my story she started to open up and started with one of many instances of   her story that how everyone judges her as a person as mature or immature attitude towards   everything and her body . Eventually while talking , both of us learned about her that the   major concern in her case was she feared judgement and that , she always unintentionally   sought approval of others . 

 <NAME> 

 So we discussed about how can we work on the real issue in this case , and we came up with   a very simple approach that she can choose to learn different point of views about her from   others but it is herself that matters the most and she should try to accept herself first . 

 This course in particular has helped me not only in understanding the importance of   storytelling but also some important tools like mind mapping and how they play a major   role in applying design thinking in even our day to day life .

"Challenge & Selection 

 I work for an international Management Consulting firm , and in one of our projects for a   company in the Health Care sector , we had the goal to increase customer experience and value   delivered to their clients . The main objective was to boost the retention of clients . 

 One of the first things we set out to do was talking and trying to understand the clients , which   were mostly small and medium enterprises from various sectors . We chose the Journey   mapping method , a combination of the visualization and storytelling tools , to conduct our   interactions with them . We believed it was the best way to make it easy for the clients to   relate to what we were showing , because they would be able to see themselves in the journey   and be more willingly to participate and share their thoughts . 

 The main things we wanted to capture were the moments of the journey in which they were   more satisfied , unsatisfied and what we could do to provide a better experience . 

 Application 

 The idea was to arrange a set of workshops with clients across the country to gather the   insights we wanted using Design Thinking tools . The main driver for the discussion was the   storytelling , which was going to be presented in the form of the Customer Journey <NAME> . We   had to map it before the workshops so we could use the time on refining rather than mapping   it . The template we used had the name of the moment of the journey at the top and for each   moment we had the intention the customer had during this moment , the activities he   performed and points of contact between the clients and the health care company . To validate   our Customer Journey <NAME> we interviewed a few clients beforehand . 

 Since we also wanted the clients to discuss solutions for the problems they were going to   introduce , we prepared some “ Solution Cards ” , visual paper cards describing / showing   solutions based on the problems we thought they would say . More than testing solutions the   goal was to use the cards to foster the creativity of the clients attending the workshops so they   could ideate more solutions . 

 Now let ’s go to the workshops . We invited around 15 clients for each of the workshops and   divided them into tables of 5 - 6 people based on the profile of the companies they   represented . We conducted five workshops . 

 For each table we gave a poster size paper with the journey and told the story we mapped so   they could relate to it and then we asked - “ What are the moments where you are most   satisfied and what are the moments that you are unhappy and why ? ” The participants wrote   their opinion on post it papers and glued them bellow the moment they were referring to .   After we did that for a while we asked them to choose the top 3 satisfying moments and   unsatisfying moments , we wanted to see what really bothered them and what made them   really happy , we called it the moments of truth . 

 After that , we changed to the second dynamic of the workshop where we showed solutions to   the complaints of the clients and asked them to rank it form “ I did n’t like this , it ’s not useful ”   to “ Wow ! This is amazing ” . After we presented all our solutions , we asked the participants   “ Based on your problems and on the solutions we showed you , what is still missing that could   improve your experience with the product ? ” – We asked them to write it down or draw it on   blank solution cards we provided them . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned after conducting these workshops is that we always have to make the   material as easy as possible for the participants to understand and also to create a very light   environment for them to feel free to share their thoughts . <NAME> is the key word in such an   event , if they do not share nothing happens ; you want them to interact and not feel afraid of   saying something that does not make sense . I learned that the first step for these workshops is   to have a good activity in the first minutes to break the ice and create this collaborative   environment . Because it did n’t work well , we changed the icebreaker activity from the first   workshop to the others , and the dynamic completely changed , the results improved a lot . 

 I saw that visualization is very good because people are more willing to look and debate   pictures or illustrations about something you are trying to show rather than reading a lot of   text . Next time I will reduce the amount of text in the Customer Journey even more . For   example , in this workshop , we wrote down the activities clients performed during the journey   and few people really read them . Next time I will illustrate all the activities with icons and   other images , which will better capture their attention and improve the flow of the discussion .

"LEARNING LAUNCH Of PROPOSED SERVICE OFFERING BLUEPRINT 

 CHALLENGE 

 I recently took over a role to incubate new service offerings in my organization . We , as an   organization currently do not have any similar offering that can be used as a foundation to evolve or   create what we want . Being a globally recognized thought leader in this technical domain ( service   management ) , I have been entrusted with the responsibility to come up with the new service line   that is apt for the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> of business services . I had already ideating and creating the   service blueprint before taking the Design Thinking sessions . So , the key challenges that I wanted to   address was : 

 •   What we conceptualized , would it really sell with our existing or potential customers ( will   they really appreciate what we are bringing forth for them ) ? 

 •   If they do , would our execution blueprint really work ? 

 <ADDRESS> 

 I wanted to : 

 •   Test our idea , our blueprint 

 •   Identify what works and what does not 

 •   If fail , fail fast → Learn →Refine → Mature → Scale 

 Thus , I was determined to conduct a series of small experiments with our selected customers , with   each experiment meant to validate a hypothesis based on one of the core components of our new   service offering . Hence , I needed to test the key assumptions that went into the creation of the   blueprint , and thus the service offering blueprint itself . Inspired by the video on IBM Story , I decided   to use ‘ Learning Launch ’ as the tool to conduct the experiments and eventually refine our blueprint . 

 APPLICATION 

 Our proposed service offering constituted of a number of elements , each of which were required to   be tested & validated independently as well as the way they perform in an integrated fashion . So , I   created hypothesis that we needed to validate for each of them . I worked with my delivery   organization to identify the customers ( 10 customers were identified based on their interest and   agreement from varied industry domains ) to whom we can take our service offering blueprint and   collaboratively refine the same . Since , I wanted to experiment and see what works for us and what   does not in minimal time , I grouped the offering elements and related hypothesis . We assigned a   priority ( based on criticality and urgency for readiness of the element for launch ) to each service   element that steered the way we grouped them . We experimented this set with one customer and   another with the another one . The purpose was to : 

 •   Maximise the elements that are being experimented in parallel 

 •   Learn and refine what does not work before experimenting with the next customer   ( initiating the next stage of Learning Launch ) 

 •   Minimize financial exposure and risk 

 Below figure depicts the approach we took to run our hypothesis testing in parallel . 

 The way we applied the Learning Launch tool is diagrammatically depicted below 

 As represented above , I created a hypothesis for each service element which drove the set of   assumptions that I wanted to validate . We tagged each offering elements and thus the hypothesis to   be tested to a customer and the sequence in which the other customers would be approached for   experimenting the hypothesis . Our goal was to experiment each service element with at least 5   customers and then decide if there was a need to take the experimentation to other customers . This   fundamentally formed the next stage of our <NAME> <NAME> . We designed the way in which the   experiment would be performed . E.g. for a service element , we did the following 5 key activities   collaboratively with our customer SMEs and resources : 

 •   Refined the customer ’s policy & process in a joint workshop 

 •   Mapping the value chain for that element / hypothesis being tested 

 •   Identified when , where and how the value was created ( if not then why → fed into   refinement of our proposition ) ; Also steered the way we represented and called out the   value , benefits and outcomes 

 •   Identified the challenges that affected the execution and the way we managed them → fed   into refinement of our execution strategy 

 •   Identified the dependencies ( in some cases , we realized this as part of challenges ) → fed   into refinement of our execution strategy with better articulated dependencies 

 To execute the experiments , we grouped our SMEs based on their experience and expertise . I   ensured that our goal is clearly understood by our team so that we all worked towards our common   goal . 

 Data from the experiment was used to refine our overall proposition – commitment towards value   creation / benefits , execution strategy and the dependencies on as well as expectations from various   stakeholders . This also attributed to refinement of our go to market strategy that was meant to scale   our service offering . 

 INSIGHT 

 As described in the previous section the insights gained from the experiments has helped us to   refine our overall service proposition . But in addition to those it changed the way we were   approaching our customers with our service offerings . 3 key ways our overall proposition changed   were : 

 •   We realized that our Service offering can be industry domain contextualised easily ; some   elements were domain contextualized during the experimentation phase 

 •   We recognized that a number of smaller or sub - service offerings can be created providing a   quick win as well as a significant potential financial return for our organization ; This even led   to creation of a number of service packages 

 •   We identified new ways in which the value was being created and more importantly the way   our customers appreciated the value . 

 APPROACH 

 I would prefer to continue with my approach as ‘ Learning Launch ’ gave us compelling benefits for   the service elements that we have tested . So far , we have been able to experiment 12 core   components of our Service Offering blueprint based on the priority that we had assigned to them . We   are continuing with the experimentation of other elements and intent to complete that by end of this   quarter . Results from the previous Learning Launch initiatives has convinced us that this is the best   approach for completing the testing of our complete offering . Additionally , it has triggered an   interest in the organization for testing the current relevance and feasibility of some of our other   ideas too . One thing that I would preferably want to change for experimenting the remaining service   offering blueprint would be to have more customers from each industry domain as it would help me   in having a greater confidence on my domain contextualized offerings .

 CHALLENGE & SELECTION 

 The tool I used was the tool of Visualization , to achieve a shared understanding of a problem among   a diverse group of people before attempting to identify or define possible solutions to the problem . I   am an MBA student and in a lot of situations we need to work on case studies with the diverse   section of peers we have at our college . Visualization helps us to filter the data available and   represent it in an easy way which is understandable by all . Also , visualization helps me to present my   ideas in a way where everyone is on the same page and level of understanding which becomes   difficult verbally , specially with diverse group sections . Visualization allows a diverse group of   students and the corporates involved to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope ,   boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain   points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 APPLICATION 

 We start by coming with different ideas by the people involved . We use visualization to explain the   data available or used in the idea by using data representation formats like pie charts , bar graphs ,   histograms , flow charts , etcetera . In the later stage , where we come with ideas with the help of this   data , we put the working of the idea in a flow chart or flowing chart manner or using drawing or   diagrams , which makes it graspable for everyone in a lesser amount of time . This way we save time   as well as efforts in understanding and also make the experience better . 

 After , this stage we choose the ideas that we believe will give best outcome and prepare a plan to   present and implement the idea . In this planning process , we use tables , timeline graphs to get a get   better hold on the implementation and distribution of work . 

 Once , we are ready with the plan , we need to present it to the higher authorities or corporates   involved , thus it should be logical and easily understandable . We do this by using various   visualization data tools like bar charts , line charts , stacked bar charts , bubble charts , tree maps ,   pictographs , etcetera . 

 INSIGHT & APPROACH 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise is that when we are working in diverse groups   with different ideologies going in , a visualization method to share ideas is very beneficial and brings   everyone on the same grounds . The opinions are easily represented and understood and the graphic   medium helps to make it less tedious . With this , we can reach the root cause of problems and ideas   to overcome them in a lesser amount of time . Also , it helps improve the creativity and nurtures the   design side of the brains and makes it more fun and light hearted experience as well . 

 I have realized it to be a valuable and enriching aspect , and will definitely make use of it for future   works and projects .

"Reflection – Storytelling Tool 

 Challenge 

 A common challenge that I have experienced throughout the general manufacturing industry , is hiring ,   retention , and development of direct labor employees .   Often , direct labor employees come and go   frequently , staying for short terms , leaving the existing front - line supervisors and company management   feeling jaded , frustrated , and impatient .   This results in non - existent or unstructured development and   team engagement strategies , as the leadership team assumes , they will be of no use , as each new   employee is just temporarily passing through , until they have proven otherwise by staying after ‘ x ’   months or years .   The issue with this , is the cause and effect perhaps should be flipped .   We stand a   higher chance of the employee staying if we strategize and execute development activities frequently ,   rather than make those activities dependent on whether the employee shows interest and achieves a   long enough tenure .   I am sure this is not a novel idea , as I have read and discussed this on numerous   occasions with many industry professionals , and quite frankly this is a best practice instilled by many   companies globally .   However , the execution of this is still a challenge in many companies and   leadership teams .   And although there are plenty of options around what those strategies and   approaches look like to engage direct labor employees , I would like to focus more on how this challenge   extends to the stakeholders in the previous step , which are the frontline leaders , and how their buy - in is   just as important .   Initial feedback from the frontline leaders was that pay wage was the biggest driving   factor in this challenge .   However , interviews with the direct labor employees painted a different   picture .   Not only did I interview current long - standing employees , but also newer employees , including   those exiting our team upon resignation .   The most common theme around this group ’s feedback was   the communication , mannerism , and treatment from their frontline leaders was one of the most   significant factors in their job enjoyment and reasons for resignations . 

 Selection 

 This is where the <NAME> tool comes in to play .   The most important element of the <NAME>   approach is how it connects to the audience ’s emotions .   In this challenge , I was faced with a group of   frontline supervisors who did not believe in strategic team building and employee engagement   activities .   After speaking with them one - on - one , it was clear that the emotions around their challenge   of seemingly having no control over high direct labor turn - over had taken over their perspectives .   The   feeling of frustration and hopelessness overpowered any verbal directions to simply “ engage your   employees ” or “ conduct performance reviews ” .   Thus , in this situation , I felt that storytelling would be   the best way to “ reset ” their perspective , connecting to their emotions through my own stories , and   subsequently being able to provide a clear path and potential alternative “ endings ” to the stories that   they could relate back to and utilize . 

 Application 

 After the initial journey exploration of both the direct labor employees and the frontline leaders , I set up   one - on - one touchpoints with the frontline leaders .   The Storytelling began first with me recounting   some of my own stories involving my past experiences in other job roles , several of those roles also   being prior frontline leader roles , similar to the ones they held .   Based on the challenges they were   facing , which I also observed , I used my own stories to gain some mutual respect and trust , which   allowed them to understand that I had experienced similar journeys .   More importantly , I focused in 

 equal detail on the parts within my stories that resulted in employees changing their behavior and   perspective .   Through the story , I was careful to explain to them how giving everyone a chance to say   their part and simply listen and take the time to reflect , was sometimes enough to come up with   appropriate responses which encouraged development , motivation , and generation of new ideas .    Again , all of this illustrated through the story with real cases .   I was careful to carry the reflection portion   through to the actual one - on - one session .   As this course explained , the reflection at certain points upon   hearing the story is important . I paused throughout my storytelling to prompt them with questions , both   regarding my own story and directing questions relating to their own challenges they were facing .   There   was a second and third part to this storytelling application .   Through my own storytelling , which resulted   in great open discussion , the frontline leaders were able to begin telling their own stories back to me ,   which in turn helped me to understand their challenges even more .   The third part was that I   encouraged them to use the same story telling techniques with their own direct labor employees as a   way to draw them in closer into the team , especially the new employees , touching on more positive   emotion and sense of front - line leader support .   Most often , I heard them tell stories of their own   development through the business , which gave the new employees a better sense of similar   development opportunities in front of them . 

 Insight 

 One insight that I had during this storytelling strategy was that the story had to be planned .   Plenty of   times , I witnessed past leaders tell their stories very naturally , as if they were able to grab a certain story   out naturally without effort that applied to a particular challenge , that helped the team to work through   it .   I have since realized that this is not without effort .   In fact , this comes with great practice , and there   can be a method behind that practice .   The tips in this course , such as know your audience to connect   with their perspectives and emotions , is key .   I took a couple days of reflecting on my own collection of   experiences , converting them to “ stories ” , and mentally organized them into stories that were   applicable to different groups of employees , and different situations .   I found this similar to preparing   for a job interview . 

 Approach 

 I found that the storytelling approach worked very well in tackling this challenge .   Our company   experienced more positive survey feedback from both employees and agencies working with our   recruitment efforts .   We also saw lower turnover and new employees staying for longer periods .   We   even heard from long tenured employees who reported positive changes they saw in their front - line   leaders .   Given the great results , I would use a similar approach towards similar challenges in the future ,   using the same techniques and insights learned through this storytelling experience .   I think there is   always opportunity though to continue to tweak one ’s stories and focuses , depending on the situation .

 Benefits of Mind Mapping 

 In the course we learned that mind mapping is an effective creative   thinking tool 

 In its simplest form , a mind map is a collection of ideas that have been   put into the format of a visual diagram . Starting with a central idea or   topic in the middle of the map , branches radiate from the center   containing further themes and concepts to be explored – typically in the   form of words , short phrases , and images . This gives mind maps a   natural organizational structure . 

 In a mind map , information is structured in a way that mirrors exactly how   the brain functions – in a radiant rather than linear manner . It literally   ‘ maps ’ out your thoughts , using associations , connections , and triggers   to stimulate further ideas . They make it easier to extract your ideas from   your head into something visible and structured . 

 Research shows that the brain likes to work on the basis of association ,   and it will connect every idea , memory or piece of information to tens ,   hundreds and even thousands of other ideas and concepts . This is why   mind maps are beneficial for countless tasks . 

 Below , we will critically discuss how you can use mind maps to aid in   various processes , such as memorizing information , conducting   presentations and solving problems . 

 Mind maps involve a unique combination of imagery , color and visual- spatial arrangement which is proven to significantly improve recall   when compared to conventional methods of note - taking and learning   by rote . <NAME> ’s mind mapping tool is faithful to these beneficial 

 features , giving you the option to create quick box - style or highly   creative maps with adjustable curvilinear branches , as well as add   images and emojis , and change the color of your branches and text . 

 Mind maps really come into their own when it comes to encouraging   creativity and enabling you to generate new ideas in brainstorming   sessions . This is because the spatial layout of a mind map helps you   gain a better overview , making new connections more visible so you   can create an infinite number of thoughts , ideas , links , and associations   on any topic . Adding images to a map can also aid in this process by   acting as visual stimuli . Images are processed instantly by the brain ,   enabling us to quickly make associations and recall information 

 Mind maps are a great aid in learning for countless reasons . Because   they encourage the brain to make associations between different   keywords , phrases and images , they can be used by students to   brainstorm ideas for creative projects ( either alone or within a group ) ,   as well as help them to plan and structure work such as essays , reports   and presentations . Mind maps are also a great revision aid due to the   fact that they can be used to break down complex information and   improve memorization and recall . 

 Evidence shows that mind mapping can be used to help you plan and   organize your thinking before you start writing or get stuck into a   project . This is because you can use the technique to develop all your   ideas and see where they relate to each other before deciding the best   way to go about the task at hand . 

"
"Reflection - Visualization 

 Visualisation is equal parts listening , thinking and drawing . Listening is the input ,   thinking is the processing and drawing is the output . These three skills work   together equally in understanding complexity , visualising outcomes to create new   possibilities . 

 Visualisation has a role to play throughout the Design Thinking . It 's an incredible   tool , in that sense , in that we 're using those tools and that part of our brain at   each phase in the design process . It 's not just something that has an application in   one part of the Design Thinking . It has many ways of being useful at different   parts of the Design Thinking process . 

 This tool is really good for conceptual development . Helps us understand our   design more . Our brain starts creating pictures of something that does n’t exist .

"Mind mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I was a supervisor in the call center in the bank . My consultants task was to sell an extra   bank account to the customers that called call center with a problem about service or a   product . They had to sell the same kind of products every month but from time to time a   new product appeared . That is what happened that time . 

 I chose a mind mapping because it is a tool that helps to focus around a single concept   and in a visual way shows hierarchy among the pieces . We had a knowledge how to sell   different products like a personal loans or a credit cards . We also had a knowledge about   that particular new account but we needed an insight to a situations that we see on the   customers profile or that we hear from the chat to demonstrate the customer our new   account . 

 Application 

 I made 2 meeting because I wanted every consultant to be involved ( because of the   specific of call center I could n’t organize one meeting ) . In every group participated 6   consultants . 

 I started the meeting by describing the purpose of the meeting and the design tool that   we were using . We had to our convenience a room with a big whiteboard and a lot of   stickers . I wrote in the middle of the whiteboard “ how to sell a new account ? ” and ask   everybody to think and jot down on the sticker an example of a different type of   customers that call us . We stick the examples of the customers . Then I asked them to jot   down and stick on the whiteboard an example of a situation in which we can sell to that   particular customers the new account . 

 In the meeting with the second group , I reordered questions , so they stick first the   example of the situation and next the type of the customer . While both meeting we   discussed all the examples and   used symbols to make the examples more transparent .   In the end   of the meeting we took a pic of a whiteboard and I sent it to the consultants   by e - mail . 

 Insight & approach 

 We learned that no matter which question was first both teams generated a lot of   examples . Sometimes consultants were surprised they have n’t heard about such a   possibilities like those which appeared . 

 Mapping tool definitely helped us to see the new possibilities that came with selling the   new account . The longer we were generating the new ideas more levels we created . 

 Next time I ’m planning to book more time for a session because I spend with each group   45 minutes . We had a great flow so it ’s worth to use it to the maximum possibilities .

"REFLECTION – STORY TELLING 

 MY <NAME> SISTER 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In my short life , there are many experiences that could qualify as life- 

 changing . Every new experience was , at one time or another , the first experience . 

 For good or bad , each instance changed the course that my life has taken . Story 

 telling is a great tool . Stories tend to be based on experiential learning , but 

 learning from an experience is not automatic . Stories are effective educational 

 tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember . Storytelling can 

 be seen as a foundation for learning and teaching . Storytelling taps into existing 

 knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a 

 solution . That why I chose story telling as my tool . 

 Application 

 I have a story about using story telling . I met my cousin sister . Always she 

 used to be very happy . Her name is <NAME> and was 15 years old . They were a well 

 rounded perfect family of three . When I had gone to her house , I found that <NAME> 

 was not happy in her life . She seemed to be as though something is missing and 

 fearful of something . So I used my story telling tool . 

 Insight & Approach 

 I started to notice her closely why she is not happy . I identified the reason . 

 That was a right time for me to open up with my story . I told <NAME> about my most 

 transformative experience . 

 I told her how I was fearful and thinking when my mother was pregnant . 

 <NAME> is someone my parents often call a happy accident . At that time , I was 10 

 years old and both of my parents had shown more love for me . We were what you 

 would call a well - rounded , perfect family of three . We neatly fit into the perfect 

 classification in nearly every way . We did n't realize what we were missing until 

 the moment that my younger brother first opened his striking blue eyes . 

 In truth , I resented the fact that I would be having a sibling . Nothing 

 needed to be added to our family , and my mother , already 38 at the time , was 

 considered high risk because of her age . The pregnancy itself was full of 

 complications that sent the straight course of my life into rollercoaster - like loops 

 that my 10 - year - old mind had a hard time comprehending . But now , I can see how 

 forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably 

 brings . 

 The day <NAME> was born , my mother took me with her to the hospital 

 rather than my father . Sitting with her through every contraction , I gained a new 

 respect for just how powerful and strong a woman could be in what might be 

 considered their weakest moment . Holding her hand and feeding her ice chips , I 

 gained a connection with my mother that I did n't realize we were lacking . 

 The moment my new baby brother <NAME> came into this world , I realized 

 two things nearly simultaneously . First , you do n't realize how much you need 

 something until it 's sitting in your lap . Second , my life after this moment would 

 never be the same . The moment he curled his chubby little finger around mine , I 

 understood the words "" happy accident "" completely . <NAME> 's arrival was a life- 

 altering event that caused me to see the world through new eyes . 

 So I told this story to my cousin sister , it had a big impact . It had changed 

 her life and also changed a part of her as a person . <NAME> became very happy and 

 prepared herself to face the arrival of her new brother or sister . A little story can 

 do a lot of good . Story telling tool had really helped a lot to me . It is empowering 

 me , as it effectively conveys ideas and with practice , it is able to demonstrate the 

 potential of human accomplishment . So I would use the same tool for the next 

 time also .

"Desing Thinking   Vizualitation   <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> : 

 When I was in college finishing a technical course , I remember very well the   exhibitions in which we had to present some information about , the teaching material   that the teacher gave us . Many of those times we had to express our thoughts through   speech with voice . Many were bored and they did not understand what we wanted to   express .    Expressing our ideas , became detestable and no one wanted to come forward to   expose any kind of information . After a little stress on the part of the students , it was   decided to change the way we worked . 

 We decided to investigate what were the methods in which you can get attention   without having to talk too much . We did not find studies that explained that words   could get attention for only 15 minutes , after it became monotonous but incredible   because between a word and an image , the image would be more attention or   between a video and an image , the video would win and position as number 1 for   catch the attention of participants .     Another thing that we developed was the games . Everyone decided to make people   laugh while they were learning as there was more chance to remember a specific   topic . If they were willing . Here we include materials that express drawings as the   game of guessing what I express in the drawing . Game finds the couple of words and   colors , among others . 

 Selection : 

 A way to express when your mind creates based on experiences to the literal sense .    I want to say , what you imagine , you think and you get to express others through   phases of creation . The moment you think how to do something with materials that   show others classmates what you have in mind . That 's why we apply visualization . 

 Desing Thinking   Vizualitation   <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> : 

 At first , only talking was ineffective , but then we went up in level by becoming   creative . We used cut - out material creating a cut - out board where each student   expressed his goals so , for example there was one who wanted to be a wine taster , so   he symbolically put a cut out of a bottle of wine , another wanted to go to <ADDRESS> , so he   put the cut out of an airplane expressing it that way .    Videos every time we had a new topic we were looking for a video of you I had with   animation that explained contents that we wanted to express .   There everything became effective . The games played an important part as well . 

 Insight : 

 I realized that the human being is a being who always likes new things and that their   behavior is often very different , when offering different types of opportunities . 

 We are complex and constant . I change my way of seeing in the search are successful   solutions . Also , how can you control a behavior or simply change it with an action that   first passed through the imagination , well and then applied to the present . 

 Approach : 

 The next time I will more studied about human behavior and their ways of expressing   themselves . 

 <ADDRESS> everything from the environment that surrounds us to the corporal   expressions . 

 Preparation of plans that can be changed . 

 Not having a closed mind but quite the opposite . 

 Ask : Example . that this person expresses what he / she understood about the topic in   a creative way .      Note : for you , reader , I apologize if you do not understand my grammar I speak a lot of Spanish but   little English . Regards

"REFLECTION - VISUALIZATION 

 Produced by : 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 The tool used was the visualization tool to generate the development of unification and   association between two clothing design companies with totally different approaches and   styles . This tool allows us to apply ethnographic techniques after making an exploration ,   identification and creation to establish certain design criteria which will help to broaden ,   change and improve the approach regarding internal and external service with clients . 

 It begins by using visualization and at the same time with concise , concrete and creative   brainstorming that lead to an expansion and modernization of innovations of a new trend   towards customers that can be of all types and / or categories . 

 Our main focus is the comfort and taste of our clients , therefore , we inform ourselves about   their multiple opinions , also to know a little more about them we generate a series of   questions which will be answered by them , thus producing new criteria . By analyzing the   information provided in the process , we will be able to know more clearly what type of   problems we may have ( puzzles or mysteries ) , what alternatives we could use and which   process to follow would be more favorable for us . 

 Having all this , we achieve a diverse set of proposals , the aim of which is to exceed the   expectations set by customers . 

 However , we must also take into account the different perspectives , objectives and   decisions that both interested entities have , we make sure that both parties agree with the   process to be defined in order to achieve the scope that is intended , it is also essential that   for A good development of the process must have the relationships between both elements   well established . 

 According to the information obtained , several garment designs were created , which were   given some photographic sessions to carry out the corresponding publicity and make them   available to the people , a couple of days were waited to see if these designs were fully   accepted and also see if the initial objective could be achieved . 

 The results of the process were surprising , customers have accepted the new garments as   expected and good income and profits were generated . 

 It is difficult to generate different strategies or specific strategies To please customers and   that they meet their expectations equally , however , with good analysis and research , it is   possible to find the correct way to exceed expectations for a large percentage of customers   since they were generated garments to their liking and were accepted at its best , this 

 because their initial tastes were taken as the basis for designing new styles but at the same   time that customers could identify and feel really good with them . 

 The knowledge and ideas acquired during the completion of this process will help us during   future thought designs . 

 Another way to perform or even overcome the above is by using the tool of module 3   which is mind maps , since these consist of looking for patterns , sequence and perceptions   of the information obtained for the objective , with the mental map we can general and fix   several criteria which will help us to develop the process effectively , in addition to   capturing and representing the minds of our clients , thus achieving an understanding of it   even more than with the previous tool and thus exceeding the expectations initially raised .

"<NAME> <NAME>   <NAME> & <NAME> 

 The tool I use the most in my life is the mind map . It is a tool that allows one to fully understand   the logic of one 's thinking , for example reading a book with an insert in the middle of each   book , the colored mind maps are actually a small summary of each chapter and the quickest   way to recall the content is with these mind maps . If I need to read several books very quickly   and then have to extract some key points , mind maps are my most common tool , as they make   it easier for me to record my logic more quickly and then capture the essence to complete a   quick read .     Application    Mind mapping is a powerful diagramming tool that unlocks the brain 's potential . It uses all the   intelligence of the cerebral cortex simultaneously , including vocabulary , pictures , numbers ,   logic , rhyme , color and spatial perception . It uses graphic techniques to represent the   relationship between levels of subject matter in a hierarchical diagram of mutual affiliation and   correlation , linking thematic keywords to images , colors , etc . to create a memory link .     I usually use mind maps in my studies . In the first step , I use a picture that clearly represents   the topic to establish the center of the mind map ; in the second step , from the center , I create   sub - nodes related to the center ; in the third step , each sub - node then creates its own sub - node ;   in the fourth step , I use different colors , lines and pictures to represent the nodes ; in the fifth   step , I leave some space , so that I can add new content at any time and try to to put all the   content in one diagram . When I am learning a language , I use mind maps to first classify words   lexically , and then to classify meaning themes , where synonyms or antonyms are connected   again to form a new logic .     Insight & Approach 

 Mind mapping reflects the creative thinking process and therefore enhances creative thinking   skills at the same time . Comprehension and memory skills are greatly enhanced through mind   mapping , which is a great help for both logical and creative thinking . It stimulates all levels of   brain activity , making the brain more alert and more skillful in memorizing . By using the Mind   Map in teaching activities , instead of passively trying to memories every word the teacher says   and reading long strings of sentences , students actively process , analyses and organize key   words and engage in an active dialogue with the teacher , maintaining a high level of recall   during both the learning and listening phases .     So next time I will use the mind maps as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities .   Then , combining their logical sequence and the way they think can be used as a different point   of discussion for inspiration for everyone 's work and help each other , which will greatly   improve the efficiency of the work .

"VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGE & SELECTION 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding   of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define   possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our customers , who are government   workers , business men , students and retired people to apply technology innovations to modernize the   delivery of services to customer . I have used the technique of visualization of a problem domain with a   set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each   other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between   elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 APPLICATION 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or   other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three   of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . If appropriate to the   situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous research , and discussed in   <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage approach helps to reinforce   the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with whom the service provider   interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the service . The template I   often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain Providers and a   column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO , labor unions , advocacy   groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization operates . The straw man   graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If the front- stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual , either based on a high- level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders , or another format . For the activity , I will   divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a different organization or area   of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on   directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to answer , such as : 1 )   What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make   it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have about the relationships   between the entities in your problem space ? I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the   questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to those three   questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I record   commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional insights that come from the group   discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an   artifact , create a view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then 

 create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a   group . 

 INSIGHT & APPROACH 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic –   especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the   shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem space .   The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to   share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they   could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump   starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are   missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of   taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps   them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide   the values for the variables . Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and   learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking   activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference   tool throughout the remainder of their work .

"ASSIGMENT – VISUALIZATION TOOL 

 Challenge 

 I work for a mass - market brand that needs to appeal to a broader audience . On top of that it is a low- 

 involvement brand , where consumers make fast decisions at the point of sale and do not show high 

 brand loyalty . 

 However , my goal is to turn the brand into a real “ love brand ” for consumers . I believe to be a “ love 

 brand ” one needs to create relevance for individuals . I am looking for activities that can drive “ love 

 brand ” indicators such as online engagements , brand image statements and ultimately sales . 

 Therefore my challenge is to create specific benefits ( and therefore relevance ) for consumers and 

 recognize them in their individual needs while still appealing to a broad audience . 

 Selection 

 I selected the Visualization tool to approach my challenge , since I believe that the topic of “ love 

 brand ” is not a topic that can be solved through traditional ways of business analysis . 

 Visualization is a tool to encourage visual thinking ( for example through photographs , graphs , videos , 

 etc . ) . As such this tool helps you to define the challenge that you would like to solve more specifically 

 and reach a consolidated view within teams . 

 On top of that , <NAME> <NAME> ’s quote in week one resonated with me : “ [ Visualization ] allows us to 

 think in a nonverbal way . It allows us to access parts of our brain , parts of our creativity , that we 

 might not normally be using in the course of conversation . ” 

 Especially when it comes to defining what “ love brand ” really means – which presumably has a lot to 

 do with soft factors ( such as emotions , social circumstances , personal interests , etc . ) – I believe that 

 the tool of Visualization will help us picturing our consumer more specifically in all his characteristics 

 and will allow the organization to align behind a consolidated view of our consumer looks like and 

 what a “ love brand ” is to him . 

 Application 

 I applied the tool of Visualization organizing two workshops – one with my team and one with 

 consumers . 

 I asked the consumers to bring pictures , graphs , etc . to the workshop that they associated with our 

 brand and other material that they associated with brands they considered “ love brands ” for 

 themselves . We used the material to create a visual brand world on a wall on the meeting room and 

 drew connections to activities that had resonated with the consumers for other love brands . At the 

 end of this workshop we had a wall full of visualizations of what our brand currently meant to 

 consumers and where it needed to go to become a love brand . 

 We then repeated this exercise with our internal teams and similarly asked them to bring in material 

 that they associated with our brand currently as well as other material of brands that they 

 considered love brands . Next we asked them to create the same visualizations on the opposite wall 

 of the meeting room ( the customers ’ visualization was still hidden ) . 

 Afterwards we revealed the customers ’ visualizations and compared them to the internal point of 

 view . With differently colored text markers we drew connections between the two boards to 

 highlight differences and commonalities between the internal and external view . 

 Insight 

 Using the Visualization tool , helped me realize that our challenge does not only lie in defining   what 

 “ love brand ” means for different types of consumers , but also consolidating the consumers ’ 

 perception with the internal view of the brand . This was the first time we worked directly with 

 consumers on brand - related activities . 

 Therefore , the tool supported us in creating a consolidated and consumer - centric definition of “ love 

 brand ” for our brand and on top of that helped us to develop first ideas for activities that could 

 improve the brand perception . 

 Furthermore it helped to get the whole internal team behind the reworked definition of “ love brand ” 

 and the activities that were developed on the back of that . 

 I believe that moving forward we will be able to work with much less internal alignments and 

 discussions and therefore move a lot faster and pilot different activities . 

 In summary , for me personally Design Thinking is not only a good tool to create innovative , 

 consumer - centric solutions to challenges , but – maybe most importantly – a great way to align the 

 organization behind a common goal and therefore move faster and more efficiently into execution . 

 Approach 

 When starting this project I also considered using the <NAME> tool instead of Visualization , since 

 at the core I was trying to create a cause for the brand which is one of the reasons to apply 

 <NAME> according to <NAME> <NAME> ( week two ) . 

 However , I felt that before creating a cause for the brand and aligning the organization behind it 

 through <NAME> , we needed to create a more concrete view of our consumer and his needs . 

 Therefore I chose the Visualization tool to help the internal teams realize the differences between 

 the internal and external brand perception and to have a specific consumer in mind when moving 

 forward . 

 Since everyone in the team was involved from the beginning , I even managed to align the 

 organization behind a common challenge and narrative in the end and I might use <NAME> in the 

 future to further flesh out the story and motivate the team in the execution phase . 

 This course helped me to broaden my understanding of what Design Thinking means and to get a 

 more specific idea of how to use the different tools to align people around a common goal and 

 narrative ! 

"
"VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge 

 I was captain of the project team so planning and execution part of the project   was decided by me . So in my team there were 6 members who were the experts   in various domains.since , this was a huge opportunity for me to showcase my skills   as a team player I tried everything in y stride to make sure that the project was   completed within the given time frame .                                                             Selection 

 The challenge for me as a captain was to find the perfect pattern and better   utilization of team members capabilities . So I used Visualization tool to find a   solution to this frequently occurring problem . I observed all the members and   found out all of their strengths and weaknesses through SWOT analysis . I   visualized all the possible patterns according to their strengths at each positions .   So visualization tool helped me to play with an optimized use of capabilities . I   analyzed all the possible failures and advantages of each and every pattern . 

 Application 

 I allocated the tasks to each and every member of the group and gave them a   time frame to complete the task . I also kept a track of their work by having   frequent discussions at regular intervals . 

 Insight 

 By using this powerful tool my informal way of solving problems changed to   organized way of solving problems . This tool helped me seeing this challenge as   an opportunity rather than a problem . This tool enhances the thinking power so   that we can solve the problem easily . This visualization tool gave me many   solutions to the problems , from which I choose the optimized one , which helped   us in completing the project on time . 

 Approach 

 In near future I will use this tool on the planning stages itself , so that the chances   of failure can be lower . I will visualize the strength and weakness of our players   and other team players as well .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge       I work in a creative services office composed of designers , writers , photographers , and   videographers and we are challenged to produce high - quality creative assets in order to set   ourselves apart from their competitors and run better marketing campaigns . The pressures of   the modern business landscape are placing more demand on marketing teams , as well as   increasing the need for streamlined creative operations processes . Our team often struggle with   a few key issues in the effort to meet the growing demand for creative assets . For example , Lack   of workflows , Lack of data , Inaccurate forecasts , etc .   Design Thinking made me want to share the ideas I learned in the course and how I could apply   it to improve our problem - solving processes . While we do already think of creative solutions for   problems , the techniques of finding empathy , creating a problem statement , forming ideas , and   then making prototypes , will help my team to come up with better solutions .     Selection      As a team , we have decided to use the learning launch tool . Because we believe the learning   launch principle is one of the most important tools of design thinking for innovation . This   principle consists in doing small experiments to test an idea in the real market . It is a fast , low- cost way to verify the innovator ’s hypothesis . As in forth week <NAME> <NAME> gave a definition   of learning launch and explained important of learning launch . Learning launch is an experiment   in a market place and it is a process of assumptions testing and see the actions in real world .   <NAME> explained the three steps for learning launch . First step is planning the learning   launch , second one is executing the learning launch and third step is learning from learning   launch . <NAME> <NAME> gave us an examples like Dragnet for better understanding .        Application        Through the studies we managed to put into question an ethnographic research to know who   our true audience was , what he was looking for , what were his fears and his objections , among   other doubts . With the total opening of the client and together of my team , we selected 10   clients to whom they were visiting the textile store and we interviewed them . The entire team   knew the challenges and openness of just listening to what the respondents had to say , without   influencing their arguments . we focused on the structure / execution of our online marketing   tasks . In particular , we wanted to see if we could structure our tasks , projects , and processes to   adapt the methods of Scrum project management for our work ( e.g. , time boxed , daily , specific   meetings , reviews , etc . ) in an effort to become more agile . This tested our assumption that the   structure and execution were the main causes of our workflow challenge . Our team went   through a two - day training with a Scrum project management coach . Next , we went through five   workshops to structure our tasks and processes in a more agile way . These two sessions   occurred within in a three - week timeframe . We expected to produce a document with a clear   description of our new , more agile processes / workflow . 

 Insight       By applying the learning launch tool , Synchronization and the search for a solution was   something We had never experienced before . With the cross - referencing of ethnographic data ,   we identified the major objections to the product , myths and even the dreams of these clients in   possessing an ever beautiful and elegant bed as seen in movies and soap operas . I then   produced a Canvas from the whole series of interviews , thus generating a huge surprise on the   part of those involved , since the data that we had previously in hand , no longer represented who   we thought . The result could not be otherwise . Through new media using educational videos ,   our client had an expressive organic increase in search for purchases and the exponential   increase in the engagement of his audience with his brand . Now the whole team has reviewed   their work , abandoning everything they thought they knew about that particular client . This   new tool has enabled the team to be more accurate and test ideas more quickly and efficiently .   This course opened my mindset , making me a determined person to test and learn , to go on the   field even if it fails . Everyone involved is happy so I will be forever grateful for learning       Approach       The learning launch is the appropriate tool for our business . We need as a team to review the   insight gained from our first two launches and incorporate this insight into future launch   designs as this is the most effective and ideal way of approaching and implementing solutions .   Future launch designs should reflect insight gained , progress made , and come closer to a   compelling solution ready for full roll out .

"MIND MAPPING TOOL 

 Challenge 

 In my case we run this tool with our employees in order to improve their working experience as it   was not achieving the best results needed and work environment was n’t good either . 

 Selection 

 Mind mapping tool was selected as we wanted to understand what drived some behaviors of   people in job or if it was motivated by other external factors . The idea was not to just use this tool   with unengaged people but with highly engaged ones to find the differences . 

 Application 

 We divided employees in three groups , those who were 5 to 4 years , 3 to 2 years , 1 year . 

 We had 4 main blocks : 

 -   One related to stage before coming to our organization , might mean what they were   studying , why applying to our organization , needs before applying , etc . 

 -   Experience on selection process , first impressions , and expectations . 

 -   Induction , as we look on providing the whole understanding of our organization . 

 -   Performing : Work with boss , work with teammates . 

 -   Engagement : opportunities , recognition , team spaces . 

 These blocks were represented by images in the wall . Employees had to paste in stick notes their   experience , thoughts and feelings . Moreover , if there were important events they could draw   them in a paper ( inside the company were white papers , and outside the company was a blue   paper ) 

 Before starting we let them knew the importance and sincerity needed to achieve the best results .    We explained the process as they could help us to identify their motivators on their job   experience . 

 After mapping their journey experience , they we asked to stick a feeling face on how they felt   currently on job and to stick a plus image on the events they would like to keep and a minus on   those they would like to eliminate if they were back in past . 

 This tool was kind of effective as there were some structural and easy to identify issues and   opportunities but also , some more personal things that might not be so easy to change giving also   a focus on recruitment . 

 Insight 

 One of our insights was on making a harder analysis on recruitment . How were those processes   running ? 

 The other one was on implementing a governance and leadership action plan because there was a   feeling of injustice from bosses . 

 One of the insights we got it was that bosses could elect somebody to have a higher position ,   much based on their relationship and not capabilities . I guess we did n’t give employees the chance   to say this openly . 

 And the third one that we were n’t so into organization culture but innovations from last year were   giving their plus on employee experience , so it was a point to improve even more . 

 Approach 

 If I could make this once again I would clarify better the process before running it and having a   really clear way to explain it so we do n’t lose time . Moreover I would like to have instant data   collection since recruitment , induction , etc . so we can use them as a data source on employee   experience .

"<NAME> <NAME>   25 May 2017 

 Reflection- Mindmapping 

 Challenge   As an academic in the tertiary education , it is often challenging to get students to share their ideas ,   thoughts and comments especially during tutorials , seminars and workshops- my first challenge . This   situation is very common especially in my working institution of higher learning with majority of Asian   students who are more reserved and quiet . Often times I will be answering the questions posted for   tutorials in the classes defeating the learning objective and outcome of the activity . Rarely students   will volunteer to share their thoughts and even if they would , their answers are merely regurgitation   of notes with no proper linkages to real - life examples- my second challenge . The third challenge that   I face is to encourage timid students to share while balancing the domination of some outspoken   students in group discussions . This makes me wonder how I can actually do something to help the   students so that they have the right structure to think effectively and share their thoughts efficiently .        Selection   In one occasion I was introduced to a technique called Issue Trees , which is similar ( or rather the same )   with Mindmapping . I thought the tool is fantastic as it guides thoughts in a systematic way , is inclusive   creating sense of self - significance and participation , and above all it does not ignore outliers as shared   by the video of Week 3 on Mindmapping- the perfect tool which can help solve my three main   challenges .   I have chosen Mindmapping as the tool to guide my students to identify patterns and insights of the   ideas from the group to suggest solutions to business cases given in the tutorials . The tool encourages   all students to participate and have their ideas discussed even though how silly their ideas can be ,   reminding us all that most of the best - selling products today came from silly ideas . This encourages   greatly students who are timid and with low self - esteem to participate while balancing the over- contribution of well - spoken students who normally dominate the group discussions with the proper   steps of Mindmapping to be shared in the application below .       Application   Using Mindmapping in the tutorials have been fun as students are participating well and have   complimented that the tool has helped them think structurally and most importantly after the session   they have concrete solutions drawn . Unlike in the past where they have wasted time on conventional   brainstorming where most of them did not contribute and finally produced no effective outcomes .   So how did we go about applying Mindmapping in my tutorials ? Students are given a brief business   case and questions like ( 1 ) Identify the problem statement and ( 2 ) Offer recommendations to the   company were given . The students will be put into groups of 5 - 6 , given coloured Post - It notes and   markers , and will start the stages as shown below-   Stage A- Students will be given 5 - 10 minutes to think individually of ideas and write them in a word or   two on the Post - It notes and stick them on the board randomly . 

 Stage B- Students will be given 15 - 20 minutes to discuss as a group how to cluster the randomly ideas   generated in Stage A and then label / name the clusters they have . Not forgetting that outliers too will   have a place under the label of ‘ Others ’ . 

 Stage C- Students will be given 3 - 5 minutes to drawn the connections between and among the labelled   clusters to respond to the questions given e.g. <NAME> for the company . 

 Stage D- Each group will be given 5 minutes to do <NAME> where the group will share their flow of   thoughts and recommendations to the company in the business case . 

 With the four stages done , students are able to take - home some concrete recommendations and see   their time well spent with Mindmapping .        Insight and <NAME>   My students and I have been amazed by the quality of answers produced from the Mindmapping   exercise . The students ’ thoughts have been structurally guided and they see logical connections within   the clusters of ideas they have generated and could relate to the real - life examples . I am happy that   finally the students could be encouraged to participate in tutorials with pride and sense of   belongingness as they , especially the timid ones realised that they could be contributing to the group ’s   responses . Those who are more vocal found themselves listening to the rest of the group and this is   really encouraging . They have learnt that all should be given equal opportunity to share and to be   heard . This approach will be continued to be practiced by myself on more groups of students and   those whom have gone through this tool have said that they will be applying it with their study groups   and also clubs and societies . I am happy and proud of Design Thinking especially the four main tools-   visualisation , storytelling , mindmapping and learning launch as I admire the impacts on my students 

 and also myself . I am always mindful that if the students are given the right thinking tools they will   share them in their workplaces in the near future and the world will have the best practices in thinking .

"Challenge and selection . 

 I ’m employee as system Engineer in a French major corporate and in parallel ; I ’m <NAME> as   application developer with my brother . 

 Our Entrepreneur business model is to develop mobile application for smartphone . We are inspired   by two books « Fail Fast or Win Big » of <NAME> <NAME> and “ Art of Innovation ” of <NAME> <NAME> . To   summarize our challenge : “ Big win or Fail fast ” : Be lean and prototype quickly to validate or not our   idea . I have always plenty of idea of new applications that we could develop but because we have a   limited budget , resources and time ; Our challenge is to choose among these ideas which one we   must launch or not . The learning launch activity is an experiment conducted quickly and   inexpensively and it is all what we need . 

 Our challenge is for each idea ; we put in place two learning launch steps : 

 -   Step 1 : Is the application answer to a real need from customers ? 

 -   <NAME> : Verification : Is the application cover properly this need ( Human <NAME> <NAME> ,   function , technical difficulty … ) ? 

 The Learning Launch tool helps me to pass these two steps to know if we have to launch a new   application development . So let me introduce how I apply the Learning Launch tool . 

 Application 

 To pass the step 1 : Is the application answer to a real needs from customer ? 

 First I try to go walk in the shoes of my potential customers . I imagine a list of scenario on a paper   where my futures customers could really need my application . I try to discover for which scenario ,   my application would work and would not work . I ask myself the question if I would install this   application on my mobile and if I would pay to get it . Of course at the beginning of this step , I have   made a lot of assumptions and the goal of the learning launch will be to tests these critical   assumptions . So I do a list of all my assumption that I will try to validate . 

 I then select between 10 and 20 different people ( different age / sex / culture ) . I choose them among   friends of my friends to avoid a bias due to friendship . I organize a meal or have a drink with each   one in face to face to avoid a group that could be influenced by others expressing their opinions at   the same time . During the meal , I guide the discussion to discover if in the life ’s interviewee , it exists   some situation where my application would help him / her . My objective is to know if the application   answers the need or not . I try to know if the critical assumptions I have taken are true . For that I use   the list of key assumptions that I have elaborated before . Then , I explain to my interviewee how my   application could help him / her in this situation . First I just observe the reaction of the visage . From   my prospective it is more important to observe reactions than ask directly the question « do you   think it is a good idea » ? It protects myself from confirmation bias due to the fact that people does n’t   want to hurt me for example . 

 When I have validate the step 1 , I go to the step 2 : Is the application cover properly this need on a   functional aspect ( Human <NAME> <NAME> , function , technical difficulty … ) ? 

 To answer this question I experiment with a role - play with a group of 4 - 5 people . 

 At this step I have not yet a first beta version ( prototype ) of the application , so what I do is that I   begin to imagine the different screens of the mobile application and function to do a kind of   « prototype sketch » . I prepare by drawing on several cardboard of the size of a Smartphone , the   different possible screens of my application that I have imagined . And with these cardboards , we   “ emulate ” the application during a role play of scenarios that I have elaborated and selected in step   1 . It allows me to observe the behavior of the participants . I can test the remaining assumption . I   collect the feedback of participants to adapt / add / remove some functionality or detail in the   application and to improve the interface . If some change has to perform , we perform the changes   and do the role - play again by iterative cycle . If this step is conclusive , we begin / continue to develop a   beta version . When we have a first beta application version available , I again organize a role - play   with the real application . It allows me to validate deeply the technical aspect of the application ,   mostly when I use technology linked to real environment of the Smartphone like geo - tracking with   GPS   or internet access functions … 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learn by conducting this Learning launch activities on two different ideas / applications is   that sometimes the interviewee people just do n’t answer the question that I had prepare but instead   of prefer to give their opinion . They try to assess the chance of success of the application instead of   focusing to answer if the application could help them or not . That why now I will try to understand if   my application could help them by guiding discussion before explaining them what is the goal of the   application . Another situation that I met was that people involved in the role - play was shy and I   guessed they modify the way they would use the application in the real life and then it could bias the   conclusion . But I consider the Learning Launch tool like an estimator and an estimator is never   perfect but it is better than nothing . 

 All these steps are the first contact with the real world and it helps us to refine the application and to   fix some issues prior either losing a lot of money because the application does n’t stick any real needs   or saving a lot of money because performing later change in an application is always more expensive   than at the beginning of development . Sometimes it could be discouraging when the feedback of the   Learning Launch activities concludes that it is not a so good idea ( in fact I realize that the application   would be good for me in my special context but not applicable to enough other people ): sometimes I   have to struggle with myself abandon an idea . In that case I tried to remember that “ Innovation is a   probability game ” and soon I will have another good idea I will test it with “ Learning Launch ” tool   because it is definitely a tool that I will continue to use .

"Reflection : How to help clients to identify their problems during Counselling sessions with   the Mind Mapping tool . 

 1 . Challenge : 

 I am currently pursuing a counselling skills course my challenge is to document my work with   clients or subjects and apply whatever I am learning in the course in a practical way and provide   insights to my mentor . The practical assignments include listening skills , questioning skills , being   non - judgemental , helping clients in goal setting , re - phrasing the problem statements and several   other assignments . Clients in this context could be friends , peers , colleagues or complete strangers .   The Practical assignments are weekly in nature . All of us can tend to get stuck in certain thinking   patterns . Breaking thought patterns can help the mind unstuck and generate new ideas .    Trying to uncover the real problem , as well if possible identify the root cause of a client ’s issue is   always a challenge as a counselor . 

 2 . Selection 

 Since I am already facilitating several design thinking activities / tools , so I was ready to try the mind   mapping tool . Broadly speaking , the mind mapping tool is an excellent tool meant to unearth the   real cause of the problem . It also helps you learn more effectively , improves the way that you   record information , and supports and enhances problem solving creatively . It is also helpful to shift   the thinking and forces people to find a creative way forward . 

 3 . Application 

 In this case I had a background of the clients problem . From my observations she was a pessimist   and it was obvious since she used to keep saying “ This wo n’t work for me ” or “ I ca n’t do it ” or I   do n’t think It can ever happen ” .   I started the process by asking the client to identify the symptom of the main problem she was   facing . To facilitate this brain storming / mind mapping exercise I provided her a plain drawing A3   sheet and sticky notes . As this is an ongoing engagement with the client , I asked if she was okay   to brainstorm openly with me using this tool ? With a lot of reluctance she agreed to do so .    Note : If materials are not available , then I conduct questioning interview to unearth the problem .     I am also inspired to share what <NAME> <NAME> , a marketing professor <NAME> had to say in the   <NAME> <NAME> tool session , “ Mind mapping is one of the most powerful tools in the design thinker 's   toolbox . It 's used to look for patterns , it 's used to look for insights , that lead to more creative   solutions to your design challenge . Your participants have to move from a theme that has probably 

 been more like a label , for example guilt or no time , which is easy to come up with . To an insight   statement . ” 

 For the activity , I asked the client to name the problem on the circle in the center of the A3 page ,   and use sticky notes to make connections . I gave her two questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What if   this problem had gone away , how would your life look like ? 2 ) So What is the worst that could   happen if this problem persists ? 3 ) What would be your life review summary to have a different   perspective about this problem ? 

 I gave her approximately 15 minutes to discuss the questions and write the thoughts on the sticky   notes . Then I had her group her thoughts into clusters that made sense and some common   elements and keep aside the others . I asked her to draw branches stemming out of problem   statement on the sheet and expand on each one of them on the sticky note as keywords or   thoughts . As she grouped them and branched them out , I found that they were all correlating to   something very different , than her original problem and then additional insights came from a   deeper discussion on a A4 paper to jot down her thoughts and observations . 

 After the session , I asked her to review the sheet that combined the clustered thoughts ,   observation notes and any new insights from the personal discussion , and then create a revised   view that incorporated her feedback and thoughts on what she thought could work for her . 

 4 . Insights 

 What I personally learnt from conducting this exercise with this client is that while the sheet –   especially the revised review that incorporated her feedback – was important for reinforcing her   understanding of the underlying problem she is trying to resolve , the more valuable aspect of the   activity is the thoughts and insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to   define the problem space together.as a counselor and counselee . 

 The mind mapping tool , thus , gives an opportunity for clients and serves as a focal point for   discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root   causes of their problems . They can quickly identify where they are in the mind mapping process –   or if any thoughts are missing – since it ’s an iterative process , they can more quickly add more   thoughts on sticky notes and review . 

 They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps them to identify what they   do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide the values for the   variables . Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is , next time I would use the mind   mapping tool activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities to discover   problems and root causes . This can further be applied into a group environment , group level   problem solving and facilitate brainstorming . The mind mapping tool also helps to challenge 

 assumptions . For every situation , you have a set of key assumptions . Challenging these   assumptions gives you a whole new spin on possibilities .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is an essential tool that I and many of our staff use at work . I work at a 

 daycare center in the infant / toddler wing ( 4 months – 2 years old ) . The preschool wing makes   up the other half of the first floor of the building . We have many children raised on the infant   side that funnel into the preschool program once they are of age . Most of the kids that come in   have parents that work from 7am-6pm , so they spend a good majority of their time with us .   This means it is imperative to be patient , understanding , and flexible . Sometimes , we will have   children that may throw temper tantrums , act out , or display some other type of “ problematic ”   behavior . In the infant wing , it is easier to address such issues because our class size is   significantly smaller ( our ratio is 1 staff member per 3 children ) . However , class sizes are larger   on the preschool side ( typically 6 - 8 children per staff member ) , so it can be more difficult to   address individual concerns . 

 I had finished my shift one day and decided to visit the preschool side before I left . I 

 found two of my coworkers visibly frustrated with one boy in particular and I asked one of them   what was going on . She informed me that the boy had been hitting his classmates , calling   people names , and not listening to any of the female teachers ( he would listen to the male   teachers , though ) . Instead of addressing his individual needs , my coworkers were becoming   irritated with him not listening and would repeat themselves over and over . He was slipping   through the cracks . 

 I decided to use the <NAME> tool to help deescalate this situation . The <NAME> 

 tool is essentially conveying a message that has logic . Often , it is used to create a sense of   connection and unity . Storytelling creates a cause ; this cause has a larger purpose . For this   particular situation , I used the <NAME> tool in order to gain a sense of comradery with my   coworkers and for emotional connection- to open their hearts up a bit more to other things   that may be going on in that little boy ’s life . 

 Application 

 I shared with my coworkers the story of a little girl I used to work with who had 

 displayed similar problematic behavior . One day , I was told to come to the preschool side to   speak with a little girl ( will refer to her as “ <NAME> ” ) that used to be in my class when she was an   infant . Her preschool teachers informed me that she had been acting out , hitting others , and   refusing to participate in class activities . I ’ve known <NAME> since she was four months old and   found this behavior out of character for her . I was also aware of the fact that <NAME> ’s dog had   died about a week prior to this behavior . I had spoken to her father about it a couple days after   it happened ( it was sudden and not of natural causes ) . <NAME> was very close to her dog- the first   animal sound she ever learned was a bark . Her father showed us pictures of <NAME> riding around   on her dog ’s back and of her crawling next to him on the floor . I had a suspicion that perhaps   <NAME> ’s poor behavior was due to her coping with her dog ’s death . Children do not grieve the   same way that adults do- their brains can not process heavy emotion like that for long periods 

 of time . That ’s why you will find them upset and angry one minute , and then up laughing and   playing the next . They grieve in spurts .        Insight / Approach 

 After I told my coworkers this story , you could see the anger and irritability slowly 

 vanish and in its place were empathy and sadness . The <NAME> tool was incredibly effective   for this because it gave my coworkers a deeper understanding of what these children go   through and how they process / deal with things . It reminded them that children are still people   ( not just sweet , and loud , little energy balls ) . Children are far more observant than we give   them credit for , and they feel so strongly . They need us as adults to show them appropriate   responses to various emotional situations . One of my coworkers sat the little boy down and   they talked for a while . Turns out , the little boy was angry at his mother because she was   having another baby . From there , my coworker was able to talk with the boy about his feelings   regarding the situation and what they can do from there to make things work in class . That   individual attention was just what he needed , and it made class easier for everybody . 

 Next time , I would definitely reuse the <NAME> tool . I find it to be such a necessity 

 when trying to connect with someone on a deeper level , or to get someone to understand a   concept . It worked well this time and I ’m happy to have had it in my mental toolbox . 

"
"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared   understanding of a problem space among a diverse students before attempting to identify and define   possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our university , whose departments   work to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their services to   their students , which may be ensamiens students , or not . I have used the technique of using a straw   man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a   students to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries , key elements ,   and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for   improvements or solutions . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials . If   materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the students who   serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . If appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the   concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous research , and discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book ,   “ The Connected Company ” .   The front - stage / back - stage approach helps to reinforce the notion that   every service – even an internal service – has customers with whom the service provider interacts   and internal processes that enable the university to provide the service . The template I often start   with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain Providers and a column on the   right to identify Oversight organizations that may add constraints to how the organization operates .   The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If   the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual , either   based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different students or another format . 

 For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a 

 different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man 

 graphic that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three   questions to answer , such as : 

 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 

 2 ) What would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ?   3 ) What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities in your problem   space ? 

 I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have   each group report out on their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on   their poster . As each group reports out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and   then additional insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic .   After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared 

 and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their   feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic –   especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is   the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows   them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems .   While they could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a   straw man jump starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the   graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between   key entities instead of taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem   space – that is , it helps them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain   information or data to provide the values for the variables . Since I discovered that the most valuable   aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would use the visualization activity as a starting   point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that incorporates their   combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their work .

 Mind Mapping Tool 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Mind mapping tool is a critical design tool that harnesses the power of the brain   to think smarter ,   learn faster and communicate better . I ’m a student at my institution and my / our challenge is to   improve the workflow on the projects and activities when working with the members as a team .    So the current project is basically to develop a robotic model and we are suppose to first design a   prototype of it . While working on the project there are several challenges like cumulation of   different thoughts , sometimes lack of delivering the actual thoughts , improper synchronization of   steps while finding solutions to various problem . Using the tool we will focus on trying to   uncover the information our team members can structure , how they can analyze and put forth   their ideas through this process . 

 Application 

 So I started the process by gathering all the team members and delivering a presentation   regarding the project topic to them . While going through the presentation the members are asked   to note down the points which they find to be important also jot down those points which they   can explore and modify in a different manner . All the members had different piece of   information collected while glancing through the presentation . Once the presentation was over ,   the members were asked to paste the highlighted notes on a soft board one by one , all of them   had different views regarding every topic of the presentation . All the highlighted points were put   before the members one by one and each point was discussed in brief . What became the centre of   attraction was that every team member had valuable insight , creative thoughts and different ways   of overcoming the problems and exploring methods to finding the solution . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 The outcome of using this tool was that drawing conclusions to points had become easier ,   additionally , we thought through anticipated results , expecting to find that a more agile approach   would improve our workflow . Given that our team has already gone through several design   thinking activities / tools and are at this stage in the timeline , the mind mapping is the appropriate   tool . As previously mentioned , our team needs to review the approach towards working and   managing all the aspects for project management .   Future project management , progress made   has become closer to a compelling solution ready for full rollout .

"Learning Launch – A Reflection 

 A new process to improve B2B sales 

 Challenge :   As a consultant in a firm that specializes in Transformation Projects , we found that while our   solution / frameworks brought about good results to increase sales in the B2C ( Consumer ) sales   environment , we did not have a solution that would work effectively in the B2B space . A brain   storming session with some of our Subject Matter Experts while discussing a New client ’s problem   revealed that a lot of sales bandwidth is wasted in non - sales activities and plugging this wastage would   help to garner more sales . Hence our solution was in the direction of ensuring that the bandwidth of   the sales managers is used in selling to customers and not in transactional activities like order   processing etc . While the elements of the solution were clear , we had no first -hand experience in   implementing it . We wanted to try the solution once on a smaller scale before actually deploying it .   Hence , we got the consent of the client to implement it at one of their zonal offices before we do a   nation - wide roll out .   The challenge was to make the best use of this opportunity while ensuring that   at least some improvement is achieved ( so that the client gives a go ahead ) . As a firm we wanted to   identify the shortcomings and areas of improvement so that the solution would be robust and can   become a potential offering to our clients in the future .     Selection :   While the solution requires a roll out across all the zonal sales office of the client , we wanted to ensure   that our solution can deliver results on a small scale and surface any wrong assumptions in the solution   before we go on a full blast across all the zonal offices . We needed a quick and small pilot   implementation to be done before we can go forward . <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> was the right approach   to be followed .     Application :   We decided that we would do a pilot launch of the solution in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> Head office and would   roll out to other zonal offices after assessing the learning launch . We had an initial buy in session with   all the team members about the elements of the solution and why it would benefit the company . We   also addressed their concerns and ensured that were completely on board in transitioning to the new   process . As mentioned earlier , the sales managers had to be decoupled from the non - sales activities .   Hence , we had to reorganize the sales team by segregating the resources who would be doing the   sales calls and those who would be performing other transactions . We divided the team into four work   centers namely 

 •   Core Sales and Business Development 

 •   Customer Correspondence and scheduling 

 •   Technical Solutioning Support 

 •   Order Processing 

 We came up with dashboards to monitor the flow of work , workloads in front of each team and set   up review mechanisms for issue resolution . We had decided to do this for a couple of weeks before   we would decide on further course of action      Insights :    One of the prime criteria for being a part of the Sales / Business Development Team , apart from <ADDRESS>   knowledge of the product was “ Good Communication skills and command in English “ . But once the   Sales managers started to reach out to the customers over phone calls , we realized that many   customers were not conversant in English and hence required communication in the local language .   The target market being <ADDRESS> , there were more than 30 different languages spoken and hence 

 understanding the local language ( at least of that region ) was a must . Similarly , the customer   correspondence specialists who were taking care of mail exchanges spent a lot of time drafting mails   as they were extra cautious about their verbalization . This wasted a lot of their time and resulted in   lot of pending mails for the team . A simple study revealed that most of these conversations were   common and they could be standardized by making mail templates .   We also realized that this process   can also be used to obtain data that would help us analyze lost sales opportunities . This provided some   interesting insights that could be shared with the Client ’s Product Management team so that they can   use this feedback to improve their current /upcoming New Products .     Approach   The enquiry conversion rate started showing a marked improvement after the first 2 weeks of the   Learning Launch . The learning launch helped us to understand the areas where we could improve the   effectiveness and also reduce the lead time of deploying the New process . We incorporated our   learnings from the Pilot as a part of the Standard Operating Procedure for the upcoming roll outs .   We   have also decided to involve the current Zonal Office head in the Upcoming Buy in sessions so that   she can share her first - hand experience of the process and the benefits that they realized . Thus ,   Learning launch proved to be an effective tool , albeit in a quick and dirty manner before we could do   a formal and robust roll out across all the zonal offices in the country .

"Visualisation 

 Challenges and Selection 

 The organisation for which I was interning asked me created the standard operating   procedures for their four departments of Web Development Department , Cloud Department ,   HR Department and Accounts Department . The development of standard operating   procedures was taking place to improve the efficiency of the departments and find the gaps in   the current ways of working of the department . So for the development of the SOP ’s , I   choose the tool of visualisation as it would   help create the SOP ’s in a manner that would be   understood by all . 

 Application 

 I started the creating a business canvas model for the organisation to have an concise and   crisp representation of the corporate strategy of the organisation . Then we used diagrams.net   to create process charts of the different activities of the different organisation . We assigned a   different color to each department and used it to represent the presence different departments   in the working of a particular department . It was a way to integrate the processes of the   organisation 

 Insights 

 The process charts we easily understood by the all the members of the organisation because   of the visualisation tool   being used .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Grocery Purchase Software 

 Challenge – A whole sale dealer of grocery supplies ( Perishable and canned foods ) hired my   team to develop a software for grocery stores to purchase their daily supplies . They were   getting requests through emails , in excel files , over the phone or through Fax . They wanted to   give a better experience to their customers as well as gain some control on the inbound sales   process . 

 Selection – To understand customer needs in - depth and confirm our understanding of pain   areas with them , we invited couple of employees from 3 of the grocery stores which purchased   supplies from our customer . Since we had only limited time with these employees and needed   to capture the design criteria quickly , we choose the visualization tools and technique . White   boarding sessions were done which were converted to Straw - Man Diagrams which was easy   and quick to understand . 

 Application - Employees were not just asked about the supply purchasing process , but also   about their overall typical day . This was re - created into Straw man diagrams and handed to   each of the employees . In <NAME> to empathize with the employees , they were also asked to   note down what were their pain points during inventory management and replenishment   process , against the respective steps in the diagrams . 

 We referred to techniques referred to in “ The Good Kitchen Story ” and the “ Visualization tool ”   videos in “ Design Thinking for Innovation ” course by University of Virginia 

 Insight – Having direct discussion with the end users of the software and having them look at   the visualization of their problem statements gave lot of new insights for the inventory solution . 

 Employees were noting down inventory levels every day in an excel or using pen and paper ,   then consolidating it at the end of the week and then sending it to the vendor . This sometimes   led to out of stock situation . Restocking was done during customer hours which was making it   inconvenient for both customers and the store employees . Where to stock which product was   also was a pain point as many employees were part time and were not familiar with store   layout . We also identified that it would be quicker for employees to scan a bar code to add a   product rather than typing it in . These inputs will help us to build a software application which   would not only have ordering feature but also allow the employees to also alleviate some of   their pain points . Also , feedback was given to the whole sale dealer to deliver packages before   Store business hours and how the packaging should be . 

 <NAME> Given the circumstances , the Visualization technique was appropriate choice . It gave   the employees an opportunity to open - up about their pain points by looking at their store lay   out , how they navigate around it and what they do on a typical day . During Idea generation   phase , we plan to choose <NAME> <NAME> tool to test our assumptions about the software and   ensure its usefulness .

"The <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> 

 In a rush of everyday activities modern people have to be well organized to complete as much work , as   it`s possible . For example students . Nowadays they have to learn more subjects than students did in the   past , but < to be honest , except study and education we ( I`m a student too ) also want to “ live ours lives ”   , have a lot of impressions and fun . A diligent student understands all importance of hard - working in his   study and why does he need it , so the variant of spending less time on the educational activities is really   bad . That ’s why one of the best decisions is to do all assignments well with 100 % quality , and do it   quickly to have more free time . For this target smart students ( and other intelligent people ) use special   tools and techniques . To do well we have to plan well and <NAME> <NAME> is really great tool . 

 Selection 

 Mind Mapping is a special technique to plan ours work , to create an understandable projection of ideas   ( to structure an information )   and for finding the right   answers on our common problems . 

 Application 

 I use it for   planning everyday activities , for making clear   conspectus ( of your course , for example ) to   remember different info by a creating memorable visual image . 

 Insight and approach 

 Since I have begun to use the Mind Mapping I got a real success   in rhe   planning and structuring ( and   remembering )   the information that I needed . I will use in the future obligatory and will not waste time   on procrastination , when I don`t understand what to do . 

 I hope my experience will help to provide it in your life !

"Challenge and Selection 

 I work in a public university in <ADDRESS> , in a unit that develops projects with the aim of bringing   the community closer to the university , with community work developed by teachers and   students , meeting the demands of the community in their different needs . As we operate in   the management of these projects , which are currently approximately 200 in progress , we   have a great challenge in publicizing these actions to the community , both internal and   external , to increase the visibility of actions and engagement . In order to escape from the   traditional institutional narratives coming from the university 's official vehicles , with   predominantly journalistic language , we seek to use the <NAME> tool . We propose to tell   the stories of the projects in a way that the readers could get involved in the narratives ,   reinforcing the connection between the projects and especially among the people involved in   the projects . 

 Application 

 I started the process by searching for a content platform that could create a more interactive   layout for the stories produced , ensuring that we could analyze how readers were engaging   with the published content and also how they could easily share the stories in their social   media . So we found Medium , and there we created the blog of the project called Stories of   Extension , being the space for the publication of the contents   ( <URL> ) . 

 The contents posted on the blog have followed the characteristics of storytelling , trying to   describe the project based on the vision of its participants , betting on a more emotive   narrative , highlighting the role and values of the people involved , as the main characters of the   story . In each new content we seek to show the connections built by the people in the   communities , focusing on the problems that the projects are solving in the communities ,   engaging these individuals in this mission . 

 As a source of data for these stories we use the reports produced by the projects as well as   interviews with those involved who are rich sources of information for the stories . 

 Insight & Approach 

 After the publication of the third content we began to realize that the blog was being visited   more by the internal community , formed by the teachers and students involved in the   projects . As this public also needs our attention , precisely because the lack of integration   between the projects is one of the points that we should improve , we saw in this new context   as something very positive . We noticed that teachers and students , in addition to   accompanying the content posted on the projects , shared and talked with colleagues about   them . This has helped improve the integration between the projects , making the community   better know the work developed in the community , enabling new partnerships . In addition ,   project members have disseminated the published stories to communities , which has   contributed to the visibility of these actions . 

 As I learned about using storytelling , I realized that it is an important tool for engaging ,   engaging the audience with content . Those who have had their stories told realize that they   are part of a larger context , not only of the project as a single action , but of a larger whole that   is the university and its impact on the community .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am an engineering manager responsible for product development in a high technology , capital   equipment industry .   My challenge was to understand as quickly as possible which of several design ideas   for a new product enhancement is the best choice . The new feature incorporates elements of machine   automation with some ergonomic considerations of the operator running the equipment .   The functional   requirements for the enhancement were decently understood , but cost budget of the design less so .   “ As   cheap as possible ” was the request from the product manager . The project also had a clear schedule that   a beta unit be retrofitted to equipment in the field in 5 months .   The most cost - effective idea had the   highest technical risk .   My group did not have enough design resources and my company did n’t have the   budget to pursue all the ideas to an advanced , beta - ready status . 

 Selection 

 I applied the Learning Launch tool to my challenge .   I needed simple , efficient experiments ( “ small bets ” )   to determine which of several design proposals should be pursued in further detail with confidence to   avoid costly ( dollar and schedule ) changes in design direction later in the program . 

 In larger companies such as mine , the cultural pressure is to only test very complete designs , thinking it   saves time and money .   Unfortunately , this approach delays the quick learning necessary to refine the   product design .   This is a poor interpretation of “ do it right the first time , ” which really is about getting   the first shipment to the customer right the first time , not the first learning prototype . 

 Application 

 The initial emphasis was to test the ideas with the highest risk , but we decided to run a test on the less   risky options so there was a baseline reference for functional performance .   Having this baseline   performance of the most conservative approach helps deter any biased stakeholder from concluding we   should choose a higher risk option ( e.g. let ’s just go with the cheapest one ) that fits his / her biased agenda   because there is n’t data that says it ’s going to be any worse than the more conservative approach .   Also ,   even the lowest technical risk option had enough complexity that the technical team believed it required   basic validation to provide confidence it was a viable option . 

 <NAME> was a major issue guiding definition of the learning launches .   The various design options   consisted of 10 to 30 components involving a various mix of engineered , build - to - print parts and catalog   items .   The project schedule did not allow long lead - time procurement of build - to - print parts of the   complexity expected for the final design .   Although the final design was expected to utilize machined   metal and complicated formed sheet metal parts , the engineering team proposed minimum viable tests   utilizing readily available materials such as aluminum tubing , wood and plastic sheet . Parts were fastened   together with screws and industrial tape .   Representative concept parts could easily be fabricated from   these materials using hand tools , avoiding costly and time - consuming procurement from commercial   fabrication shops .   Several parts with complex geometry were constructed with a 3D printer . 

 Insight 

 We performed several learning launches on the design proposals using our simplistic models built from   easy - to - fabricate , easy - to - modify materials .   We were able to get the critical feedback of the different   design proposals to start the detailed engineering design in time to keep the project on schedule . 

 One important insight is the value of involving non - technical stakeholders in planning the learning   launches . A very typical approach to such a project by non - engineers is to demand an accelerated schedule   for a complete , production - ready design , and then demand an accelerated procurement schedule of the   design .   For projects with aggressive time lines , this approach often fails because it allows for no   learning / tweaking cycles and any changes will jeopardize the schedule commitment to the customer .   In   discussing the learning launch testing options with the stakeholders , the technical team realized   <ADDRESS> was a major concern . The non - technical stakeholder ’s initial insistence of highly detailed and   complete prototype was largely based on the belief that was the best way to evaluate serviceability and   <ADDRESS> .   The technical team proposed simple 3 - D wood / foamboard mock - ups to adequately illustrate   these concerns . 

 Approach 

 The learning launch tool was appropriate and very important to the success of this project .   But what   was reinforced in my mind is the importance of managing the mindset of all the stakeholders to accept   simple , approximate prototypes to get the necessary learning as early as possible .   Addressing this   mindset is especially important in a large corporate setting where various stakeholders ( finance ,   marketing , manufacturing ) can easily fight simple learning launch experiments because it does n’t easily   fit their metric - driven environment .   Because the mindset of all the stakeholders needs to be aligned for   a project to be successful , I think the use of the “ Mind Mapping ” and “ Visualization ” tools has important   application to achieve the necessary buy - in to allow the proper environment for rapid - learning   prototyping .

"Storytelling Reflection 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is a great tool that I use all the time . I teaches graduate students with a local   University . One of the topic I covered is the understanding of the different modalities of   change brought about by digitisation , digitalisation and transformation in a business .   My   challenges is to be able to explain these often - used concepts to the class .   All are some form   of changes brought about by use of technology or digital tools .   Many participants have   vague understanding what these concepts clearly mean and like any lay - person used them   loosely in everyday business context . Most will consider any use of IT or automation as   digital change and any change to introduce technology is thereby transformational .   I usually   share stories to help students better appreciate the differences between these 3 types of   digital change . 

 Application 

 One aspect that I wanted the students to understand is what makes the use of technology   transformational . It is not adopting the latest technology or the new technology that   matters . While technology is at the core of digital transformation , it is the way how   technology are being adapted to fundamentally change the way work is carried out that   differentiate transformation from other change . 

 I use this story which I experienced some years ago to bring this across .   It used to be an era   where offices own separate laser printers , black - and - white or colour printers . In addition ,   they will have other standalone machines such as photocopiers , scanners , fax machines etc .    Operating cost of inventory and maintenance of these separate equipment are high . There   were other sustainability issues such as wastage uncollected print outs , health hazards with   toners dust when machines are placed around working staff etc .   How do we think about   transforming the printing business ? “ Cloud Printing ” was implemented , the company   introduced networked multi - function devices that can perform all the functions of print ,   scan , copy and fax .   These Smart devices can be remotely managed and integrated to staff   passes where one will need to tap to collect print outs , one could send printing securely to   different buildings or overseas locations and have them picked up by the designated   recipients . It simplifies the accounting of usage as the device can track who is printing what ,   this help to manage waste from printing the unnecessary . This initiative drastically improve   the management of printers , reduces the number of devices and change the way people   uses printing in the organisation . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This is a simple story to illustrate the transformation of work arrangement through the use   of technology .   It happens 10- years ago but had big impact on the way the people works   during those days .   In class , while there can be textbook definitions of concepts , it is easier   to visualise them when a story is used to explain .   The ideas presented can be best illustrate   through story telling when one used of the same technology may be transformational in one   company but not in another . 

 As part of the lesson , I would invite the participants to also think along the same and share   their own stories , their own examples about digital transformation in their own   organisation .   This part is often appreciated and the student feedback such sharing through   story telling is useful to their learning .

"Challenge 

 Mind mapping as a design thinking tool helps many of us in multiple situations . It can be used in   situations of various practices / activities or for organizing a personal or a family schedule or for   setting one ’s career goals . More importantly , one can also do a case study analysis using the   mind mapping tool . 

 I belong to an educational institution as an academic administrator . I understand that , in an   educational setting , both for teachers and for students , a tool , such as mind mapping can be very   helpful . However , there are always various ways to make these mind maps work for us in   varying situations . Here , I explain about using the mind mapping tool , when working on a case   study analysis as part of my course in the class . 

 Selection 

 Let us find out as to whether our students can and why should they use mind maps . 

 In one way or another , probably all the students have used mind mapping technique , while   studying .   It is natural for our brain to multitask and to perceive the information simultaneously .   When we look at a picture , we see it all at once as a composite image that consists of different   details and features . 

 We naturally think in pictures , or rather collections of images and associations . Let me illustrate   an example now . You see a brand advertisement like <NAME> <NAME> and you think of a big   mac , then further of fries and cola , which you may have ordered being in your car , when you saw   a lamp indicating the necessity of oil change . You think that you need to hit a gas station , maybe   the next morning . But unfortunately , you can not do it then as you have an important meeting in   the office that you have to attend . This is how <NAME> <NAME> brings you to the thought of a   work meeting . 

 On the whole , mind maps are very natural for our brain as they have similar connection structure .   That is why using these maps can improve all the processes connected to our brain activity ,   including studying processes . 

 Application 

 While discussing case studies in the class , it is usually based on the material students go through   in their class . A lot of information can be taken from the notes one makes during the lessons .   When you make notes in class , mind mapping can help you a lot . 

 All students make notes . Most of them write these notes as a simple text , sometimes highlighting   the key points . Such notes have several disadvantages , though : 

 •   They have a difficult structure or no structure at all . 

 •   They take a lot of time to make . 

 •   It is hard to remember something from such notes . 

 •   Creative parts of the brain are not stimulated , as when you only write down what your   teacher says word by word , you can barely get any associations in your head . 

 The main flaw of these notes is the lack of structure and key categories . Such papers look like   walls of words . Sure , you can highlight some things , but it does n’t help much . The primary   definitions are always hidden by the big amount of the text . 

 If you use mind maps for taking notes , you will remember the information more vividly ,   especially if you have a photographic memory . Here are the pros of making notes with mind   maps : 

 •   You get a clear structure . 

 •   You comprehend the information better . 

 •   You memorize the main categories and key points . 

 •   You get a logical summary . 

 •   You get a minimum text , etc . 

 Therefore , start preparing for making case studies beforehand by writing clear notes . Please find   below an example of using a mind map on pricing models . 

 Insight 

 The process itself – organizing the material 

 Mind maps can really help you , if you have a lot of different material taken from books ,   websites , magazines , encyclopedias , etc . If you are overwhelmed with loads of information and   do n’t know where to start , you can begin with making a mind map adding the information that   you have and the sources . 

 You can start your work with pointing out the main thought , fundamental idea or the message   of your case study analysis . If you clearly know what you are writing this paper for and what   conclusion you want to come to , the rest is all about the technique . 

 The next step is formulating the central thesis of the case study . They can be the subheadings of   your work . Then , you can just add any key ideas and thoughts to every subheading . At this point ,   your mind map will grow , and you will see the whole picture clearly . Thus , it will be much   easier for you to write the entire text of your case study analysis . 

 Approach 

 Using mind maps in case studies 

 Apart from using mind maps for preparing the material for writing a case study analysis , you can   use a map in the work itself . 

 You can either provide some information through a mind map ; duplicate some part of the text to   make it clear and visual or to summarize the whole work in a clever way . The teachers would   most likely appreciate such a creative approach to writing a case study analysis , so one would   definitely try it once . 

 For creating a mind map , try not to make it too complicated ; it may only confuse you and draw   you away from the main points . Sometimes it is easier to make several mind maps instead of   trying to fit too much information into just one . Or you might consider creating a concept map . 

 Using mind maps is not only a great thing for working on a case study analysis , but also an   excellent technique to use in other educational processes . You should work on your personal   style , as mind mapping is a creative activity that can be performed differently by different   people . 

 You can come up with your own ways of processing information and adding it to your maps . It   does n’t matter if your maps are distinct from the ones of other students ; every one of us thinks in   a different way . Let mind mapping show everyone the way he / she thinks .

"1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 A friend of me and I are currently working on a small startup idea in the field of professional   computer gaming . We´ll set up a transfer market information page for professional gamers   and teams . The challenge we´re working on is : how to get relevant and high quality data to   provide for the audience ? Since professional gaming is not as mature as other sports , it´s not   that easy to get accurate data about gamers and teams . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected 

 I used the mind mapping tool to generate and cluster ideas and possibilities to gather the   necessary data . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge 

 The Mind Mapping was applied with a brainstorming session , a research / validation session   and an expert interview session . First of all we brainstormed as team , what kinds of gathering   methods are possible . We found four categories and clustered them on the map :   Crowdsourcing , manual input , Experts , and Data Providers . On the second step , we gathered   further information to every cluster on the internet and extended the mind map . We looked for   possible experts , looked for similar pages for other sports with crowdsourcing approaches and   how they´re doing it and so on . Finally we talked to relevant people in every cluster to finalize   the map . We talked for example to Data Providers , and Experts . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your   challenge 

 The value was very high and we gathered lots of great insights for our idea . Lots of the work   went directly into our pitch deck and we´ve selected expert input and crowdsourcing in   combination as the most valuable and cost effective methods . Especially the research and   interview data were very helpful . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool   you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 I would apply the mind map again since it´s very simple and just does the work for such kind   of challenge . We were able to organize the fast growing data set and it was very flexible . Next   time I would additionally to the analog post it ’s , I would use an online <NAME> <NAME> tool .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I ’m a member of the TC Consulting organization inside my company , and I ’m responsible for a team of   Technical Consultants . 

 Our Customers are Mobile Network Operators for which we act as the primary technical interface . Each   Technical Consultant is assigned and responsible for a defined group of Customers . 

 Each Customer is quite specific in terms of requests and processes , and our challenge is to be able to guarantee   a good level of customer support even when the Technical Consultant is on holidays for periods longer than 1   week and a backup is needed . We have observed , in fact , that often the backup is not able to properly assist   the Customer as he / she does not have all the elements needed to support ; the solution has always been to   contact the employee that is on holidays to get the missing information , and this is the kind of situation that we   want to avoid . 

 The duration of the project is 6 weeks and it involves 4 Technical Consultants , 6 Customers and key   stakeholders such as 3 Sales Managers . 

 Selection 

 It is supposed that the project team has already gone through preliminary design thinking activities and tools   and that we have identified possible causes and solutions of the challenge we have ; at this point we want to   test that our assumptions are correct and we are ready to use the learning launch tool . Such tool is used to do   an experiment by which we can quickly and cheaply test our idea . 

 Application 

 Our first assumptions is that the difficulties faced by the backup employee are due to an inaccurate forecast of   the type of requests and related priorities that he / she would receive from the Customer . The backup is usually   informed and prepared to support about the ongoing activities , but not when unexpected requests are made .   To prove our assumption , we put in place the following experiment : 

 We involve each Customer , few days before the employee leaves , in order to have as much information as   possible about the activities , their priorities and the type of requests that the backup will receive . We schedule   half an hour meeting with each Customer , with the Technical Consultant in charge of the Customer and with   his / her backup . Optionally the Sales Manager can participate . After the meeting , the backup is instructed in   detail by his / her peer about the activities and requests discussed with the Customer . An additional advantage   of this approach is that the Customer should be somehow forced to stick with the requests discussed during   the meeting during the Technical Consultant absence . 

 Our second assumption is that usually the backup is involved too late in the handover activities . This results in   inaccurate transfer of knowledge and difficulty for the backup to get acquainted with the Customer activities in   due time . To prove it , we want to involve the backup at least 1 week before the employee leaves for holidays . 

 In practice , it means that the backup is put in the loop of all Customer emails and , as soon as he / she   encounters a topic that is not clear , asks for details to his / her colleague . This is also a way to reassure the   Customer that we are working to guarantee continuity in our support activities . 

 Insight 

 By applying such experiments we believe that our 2 assumptions above will be confirmed . We also expect that   we wo n’t be able to eliminate all unexpected requests , but at least the Customers will be more tolerant if we   wo n’t be able to answer as expected . 

 In general , we expect an improvement in terms of Customer intimacy and mutual trust . 

 Approach 

 We believe that the Learning Launch tool is the appropriate one , as the team already went through other   design thinking processes . The Learning Launch tool is easy to be applied and probably the best one , in this   specific case , in order to have direct and quick Customer involvement . With this approach we can measure , day   by day , the effectiveness of our idea .

"<NAME> <NAME> ’s <NAME> - <NAME> 

 <NAME> & <NAME>   Besides my career path as a business analyst , I ’ve taken my time to be an aspiring entrepreneur   focusing on food business . My challenge is to actually encourage healthy eating and promote   health awareness among the populace within my provincial hometown during the current   pandemic and even when things return to a new normal while also increasing sales for both the   physical and online transactions . I firmly believe that a healthy diet has a major impact on both   our physical and mental health especially during this lockdown in our area . I also research that   having a good diet also plays an important role in helping avoid and manage depression   alongside other illnesses which have all increase at a drastic rate due to lockdown . I also found   that not all of the people within my hometown are literate so I ’ve adapted new methods to   approach them . One of those methods is by explaining how a healthy diet can affect their lives   for the long term in the local dialect via the online website where they purchase the food from .     Application & Insight     Grateful for having a business analyst career , it requires me to be a good storyteller between   the clients and the developers . I remember how important it is to listen to people with   empathy since most of the projects I ’ve done are focus on reengineering their traditional roles   to a more digital approach such as automation of tasks . However , for the food business I have   to apply the same empathy for I treat each of my customers as human beings deserving of   healthy lifestyle . When customers are treated with care , they in turn spread the same empathy   to others creating a cycle of healthy promotion in their circle of connections from peers to   family . I have a few family members that have an unhealthy lifestyle of fast - food consumption   so I could tell that it does n’t get better without a change to their diets . But by storytelling I was   able to convince them that if they want longer lives and healthier feel throughout , they must   change their eating habits . With that in mind , I also want to use storytelling for fulfilling my   advocacy of healthy diets in my hometown . 

 Approach     When I told a story of how healthy diet truly has a major impact on our lives to my family   members , I set an example to them of the journey of once an obese person with dedication and   will to be healthier disregarded his old habit of consuming too much junk food and the good   consequences that came after his right decision . It made them feel connected to the person ,   the problems they might face during the swap to a new diet and the wonderful things that will   happen to both their physical and mental well - being . Now thanks to the various platforms for 

 my food business whether online or physical I made sure that the advocacy of healthy diet is   promoted . Thanks to this course , I learned how storytelling is one of the most important tools   to have in life whether in career , business or relationships .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I was tasked with helping one of our departments with re - imagining how they accomplish their work .    Their caseload had increased dramatically over the past few years , but there was n’t budget for   additional staff , and consequently , they were falling further and further behind .   Our goal was to find   ways for them to change how they worked so they could handle the increasing caseload without adding   staff positions .   I was responsible facilitating the project and one of my first tasks was to collect   information about the current state , including feedback and insights from staff , so that our small team   who would participate in the ideation session could start from a shared understanding .   I used   visualization throughout the project at many different steps , but in this reflection , I ’ll discuss here how I   used it to define the problems and create a shared understanding of the current state . 

 Selection 

 I was an outsider to the group who was there only to facilitate and organize the efforts , so I had to get   up to speed on their work processes very quickly .   This was n’t easy .   The department had lots of detailed   procedures , but nothing that connected those procedures into a bigger picture of workflow .   Also , they   used lots of jargon to describe their work and also had confusing naming conventions where the same   word or phrase could refer to multiple parts of the process .   It was difficult to understand their thoughts   and feedback with all the confusion about “ vocabulary . ”    To make sure that the staff and I , and   eventually the small team who would participate in ideation sessions , could be confident that we were   all on the same page during our conversations , I decided to use a visualization tool .   Visualization allows   us to align our understanding with others because a single visual picture grounds us in the same   understanding in a way that words do not .   In particular , I created a process diagram of   current state   and used it as a tool in my conversations with staff . 

 Application 

 First , I conducted 2 - 3 interviews with the team managers and reviewed existing procedure and training   documentation to draft a process diagram for the current state .   The diagram included each major step   of the process .   I indicated via symbols whether the step involved working with physical materials or   electronic materials .   I showed which roles were involved at each step by using color - coded stick figures .    Once I had created this high - level process , I conducted additional interviews with staff using a series of   specific open - ended questions .   Those questions were 1 ) how well does this diagram represent the   current process and what , if anything , should be changed on it , 2 ) which parts of the current process do   you think create the most problems and why , 3 ) which parts of the current process do you think work   well and why , and 4 ) what else do you want the team working on this project to know .   As we went   through the interviews , I had them to write their thoughts on the process flow ( each person had their   own copy ) and encouraged them to use symbols like happy / sad faces or stars or question marks to   capture their feedback .   Using visualization to ground and structure these conversations was extremely   effective for me .   I was able to be confident that I understood exactly which steps and parts of the 

 process the staff was talking about when they provided feedback and that my understanding of the   current state was n’t confused by difficult jargon or confusing naming conventions . 

 Insight 

 Not only did visualization help me create shared understanding , it also provided other benefits .   It was   extremely efficient .   After instituting the process map in my interviews , the quality of the conversation   was richer and the interviews actually took less time .   Additionally , I had artifacts from the interviews   that directly recorded staff ’s thoughts and opinions that I could go back to reference later and that I   could share with others so they could see first - hand feedback .   Finally , I was able to easily find patterns   in the feedback and to communicate them to the small team that would participate in the sessions to   ideate changes and improvements .   All of this led to better conversations and ideating in the next step   because we had a solid basis of understanding to start from .   While this project was n’t designed using a   Design Thinking approach specifically , I realize now that many of the most effective techniques that I   used , like visualization , are included in Design Thinking . 

 Approach 

 If I were to do a project like this again , I would definitely use Design Thinking more deliberately .   While I   think that the use of the process diagram for gathering information about as - is was useful , I do wonder   if it might have constrained some of the thinking about the challenge space .   Because we were grounded   in a visualization of process , we talked mostly about process .   It could have been helpful to spend some   time thinking about the people involved in the process from a more human - centered approach .    Visualization could have been helpful here too .   Also , we produced a rather large briefing packet for the   group that participated in ideation .   If I were to do this process again , I might consider using the mind- mapping technique instead of the large briefing book .   I think we would have had more engagement in   the early part of our ideation sessions and potentially some more creative ideas .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge : 

 I work as a Digital Product Manager at a fintech and I manage various digital consumer lending products .    I manage a product called “ eDebit ” in which upfront credit is given in the wallet of the user and he   can utilize it across recharges , shopping , bill payments , other merchants etc . wherever our   organization ’s wallet is accepted as a payment method . In order to take this product , the user has to   select the relevant amount and tenure ( for EMI repayment ) and authenticate himself through the Debit   Card . The challenge is to reduce the drop - offs in the funnel and increase the conversion for the Debit   EMI product . The project scope includes study of historical data , talking to actual users ( customers ) who   applied for the product but dropped - off within the journey at various stages , and prospective new users .   The project needs to be completed in 4 weeks and solution should include new features / UX to reduce   the drop - off and improve the funnel . The resources for the project include Product Manager ( me ) ,   Growth Manager and UX Designer . The focus will be to understand what the pain - points users are   encountering within the flow / journey and how to optimize the journey . 

 Selection : 

 We have selected the “ Learning Launch ” tool as we have already gone through other design thinking   tools . The idea is to quickly test our hypothesis / assumptions . 

 Application : 

 For our learning launch , we focused on the pain - points the users are encountering within the journey .   We want to test our assumption that by improving the user experience and adding relevant features we   would be able to improve the conversion and reduce the drop - offs . We conducted focus discussions   with our actual users who applied for the product and dropped - off within the journey . The discussion   included questions regarding existing flow , issues faced by customer and proposed flow . We completed   the entire exercise within the 3 weeks timeline . 

 Insight : 

 By using the learning launch tool , we could identify and test our assumptions . We had assumed that by   incorporating new features and improving the users we will be able to improve the conversion . Also , in   specific , we analysed the historic data and figured out that maximum users are dropping on the select   amount and tenure screen and the Authentication through card screen . Almost 90 % of users who were   interviewed said that if the option to select any custom amount is provided instead of the current few   pre - defined amount options then they would be much more likely to proceed with the journey as it   gives them more control in selecting the relevant amount they actually need . Also , on the   authentication page , more than 80 % of users interviewed said that they have to enter the complete card   details every - time they want to avail the product ( 5 input fields ) and it would be much better if the card 

 details are saved so that the next time they want to avail the product they can quicky authenticate   themselves . As a next steps , our team will define the flow and UX for the two new features “ Select   Custom Amount Option ” and “ Saved Card Option ” and we will then push it for development and   subsequently launch these features . 

 Approach : 

 The “ Learning Launch ” is the appropriate tool for us as we have already used the other design thinking   tools in the past and moreover , we had some assumptions / hypothesis and we wanted to test these   assumptions . As mentioned above we will be going ahead with designing , developing and launching the   new features .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I work in the postgraduate department of a public university . As general   coordinator I seek to improve the administrative and academic processes of the   area . One of the biggest challenges outlined by the area was to find the reasons   why students were late or missed their master 's classes , generating discomfort for   the teacher who in some cases had to repeat the content of the class . Likewise , at   the end of the module they obtained low grades and punished with a low grade in   the heterogeneous evaluation of the teacher . All this generated an uncomfortable   situation for both the management of classes and administrative attention . 

 Selection 

 The first tool used was <NAME> <NAME> , which shows the steps that students   follow during their experience and relationship with the university . It allows to   visualize through a diagram each one of the phases of the student and their   interaction with the service they receive . 

 The second tool that was proposed to work was Workshop , which allows students   to directly interact with the process , give information based on experience and   help find causes and improvements in the workshop . 

 Obtaining the best from the Workshop , it was proposed to land what was found   and propose a solution in Co - Creation , in order for students to feel part of the   solution to the challenge posed . 

 Finally , the Visualization tool was used , which allowed giving a final presentation   interactively to all students , teachers and administrators , so that everyone   understands the importance of change and impact on the final result . 

 Application 

 All the previously mentioned tools were applied in work sessions with the   students ( clients ) . We recognized that the most important thing for the solution to   be successful was to listen to the voice of the students and through their   experience to find a solution to the problem . The sessions were held on Saturdays ,   so that they did not interfere with their working hours or night studies during the   week . It was kept with the students about the idea of starting this project   together , giving them the freedom to participate in the discussion of ideas , search   for root causes and analysis of possible solutions . The purpose of each workshop   was to get to know more about the student 's way of life outside the classroom ,   how their work and family load was distributed , not just the academic one . 

 Insight 

 Developing visual tools in the workshops allowed us to observe the long journeys   that students had to make to get to university . One of the realities found was to   realize that the students found it difficult to get to the university campus due to   their location , the schedule for teaching classes and the restrictions they had on   their own work . When mapping the routes , identifying the areas with the greatest   influx and displacement , it was observed that just at the time set for the start of   classes , it was related to the peak hours of traffic in the city and caused students   to arrive late to their lessons . Similarly , it was observed that there were alternate   routes that were very little used by the students , which could serve for a faster   arrival . 

 Approach 

 For next internship I would like to invite the managers and owners of the   companies where our students work , since they indirectly have a relationship with   the master 's students . I think that if they realized the effort and dedication that   was put into the project , they could give more flexibility in their work and see the   investment that there is to learn in the academic field , which would allow them to   see the positive results applied in their own organizations .

 Challenge : 

 I am working in a technology organization , leading a team responsible for growth of our e - commerce   business . The challenge that we were facing in uptake of our online transactions were very high drop   rates at the check - out of payment gateway , which was directly linked to the customer experience as   well business growth . The project included , internal stake holders ( business , technology teams ) and   external stakeholders ( customers and the payment merchants ) , all of them having a direct stake in the   project . The project was spanned on a 30 days timeline , and expected to achieve higher success rates on   the online payment processing , which will ultimately lead to better customer experience and eventual   business growth . 

 Selection : 

 The teams studied different design thinking tools and decided to implement “ learning launch ” . The   thought process was to quickly test the prototype of our idea of for possible solution take the learning   and agree on the next steps to move forward . 

 Application : 

 Since the challenge at hand involved numerous stakeholders , for our first learning launch we decided to   take to our merchants who were our partners in order to probe their end of challenge in detail . We   looked into matrix like customers session time on their website , adding products to the cart and picking   a payment method of our gateway . During all this we figured out , that most of the customers leave the   page after they click on the payment method in discussion . While rest of their data matrix remain quite   healthy . We arranged a workshop with our key merchants , and aligned ourselves to revamp our check- out page to a 2- step process and eliminating any re - directions that might be of customer ’s concerns and   drop outs and launch it on 3 - 4 merchants during our learning launch process . We concluded the sessions   in two and a half week time 

 For second learning launch , we decided to take into account , customer ’s trust factors that can be   improved by re - designing the check - out page . We did a survey with our customer ’s whose payment   were dropped during last 3 months , gathered their feedback and re - designed the payment page with   payment schemes and payment partner logos , the brands that are well known to customers but they   are invisible at the time of check out , thus weakening customer trust on the merchant and eventual   payment and services . 

 Insights : 

 With application of this tool , we identified some assumptions and applied them in our launch in order to   test and map with our assumptions .   This will help us to make informed decisions on whether we have   come up with the right solution , addressing the problem at hand or there are any iteration we need to 

 go through .    We assumed that customers visiting the merchant website even adding their desired items   into the basket drop out at payment page because i ) the redirection hampers all the customer   experience and can be fixed with a direct integration ii ) once on the payment page customers do n’t see   the brand presence with their payment instrument , lower their trust to spend money and that might   impede their intention to complete the transaction . 

 The results of our learning launch were very much complimented with our assumptions , we witnessed   lower drop rates and subsequent of higher number of successful transactions . 

 Approach : 

 While we studied different design thinking tools in order to comprehend the challenge and found design   thinking as the best suited , because of the nature of challenge , quick implementation and getting closer   to the right solution at a very fast pace . We will take into account all the factors from learning launch   phase , in order to plan the complete roll out of the solution to our entire online merchant base .

"Challenge & Selection 

 As an administrative head of a reputed educational institute which provides several specialization   programs , I have noted that though all of our departments demand the same nature of work from the   employees , each department follows the different process for accomplishing their tasks , such as   admission process , setting interviews of students , publishing details of courses , setting lectures   throughout the semester , checking the availability of the faculties , and other coordinative tasks . The   challenge is to create a unified process for all these departments , which is not only employee - friendly   but also effective in bringing expected outcomes with utmost accuracy . 

 To bring the best solution for all the departments , I have opted for the visualization tool , which includes   creating a task process for all the departments . The purpose is to reduce the risk of errors and   completing tasks efficiently without wasting time . Visualization is the key to think rethink and rearrange   ideas / imagination at the same time , which is essential to deliver the best result . 

 Application 

 To apply the visualization tool effectively , I first conducted detailed research on the current process of   each department and their reasons behind it . The analysis leads me to the following conclusion :   o Some of the employees are following the process as it was introduced to them by their seniors .   o Some of the employees do not want to take any initiative for adopting a new process as it requires 

 efforts and also using brain . 

 o Some of the employees have found smart ways of accomplishing their tasks , but are not confident 

 with the accuracy of the result . 

 I decided to integrate ERP software for the operational process of all the departments , where they have   to follow the same steps to complete a similar task . 

 To make them clear about the process , I created a chart / design board , which involved all the necessary   details and some graphics as well . During my presentation in front of all the employees , I faced some   questions about the effectiveness of the process , but later I was successful in convincing them that this   is a better and more effective way to accomplishing our daily tasks . 

 Gradually we were able to prepare a clear process for each task they have to perform . We then were   able to make that design board into the actual ERP software with the help of proficient IT professionals   ( their practical suggestions helped significantly in brining my idea into reality ) and we prepared a user   guide which has visuals and images for the better understanding . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The insight I gained by this exercise is that initially , it is difficult to make people understand about the   new process as most of them have less acceptance as it 's not in their comfort zone . But once I describe   that how this implementation can make their tasks easier using a chart / design board , everyone agreed   that it ’s an easier and also an effective way for doing the tasks that they all have been doing it   differently before . The visualization tool helped me to bring clarity on the subject with ease . 

 To achieve the same purpose with the visualization tool , I would have used PowerPoint Presentation   ( PPT ) as an alternative approach .   PPT is just the digital way of bringing the subject matter to the   audience point by point which I have successfully achieved using a chart / design board .

"Storytelling in Science 

 Challenge and Description 

 Storytelling is the tool I take as a challenge on my daily basis since my job   includes describing multiple variables that determine a particular final food   product . These need to be placed on the right track of the story with the right   sequence to make people understand the reason why a certain experiment   using x - y - z variables did or did not work . 

 At the same time , I need to assume they do not know what I have learned   from past experiments and starting my storytelling from a “ 101 story ” ,   depending on my audience , since the results have to be exposed and   explained to people on the science , marketing , sales and or business area ,   therefore , they are not very related to this area , which is food science and   food extrusion , this is a technology used to make breakfast cereals , snacks ,   candies , texturized vegetable proteins , etc . , therefore it is challenging to find   the right concepts and track of the story to be told to an specific audience . 

 Application 

 I consider storytelling a very important tool in my job since the need of figuring   out the right sequence of describing my results to people who are not familiar   with the area I work with everyday is crucial for a proper growth of my   company , as well as sharing my knowledge with other coworkers . On top of   that , everyone on my team work on a synergy and depend on each other ’s   results to end up with better end - products , therefore I need to share why I   chose to change the variables I did , and relate it with my innovation . What   does this mean ? I have been always a very creative person and not very   organized , I would always think of an idea and do it right away , sometimes   without controlling my variables , just looking for the best final product , taking   unorganized notes for future reproduction of my experiments , and take visual   notes on my notebook that were useful mostly for me and my development .   With time I learned how to control all those variables in a more organized way   and my mentors were constantly teaching me how to explain all that I did   during my experiments and sometimes even the reason why I changed some   variables on my process . 

 The area that I work on is food extrusion , which is pretty much considered   sometimes as a somehow mysterious technology , where sometimes you   would get an unexpected result without you knowing the reason why or how   it happened . That will make some people crazy , so I needed to put all my 

 knowledge together and look up for more resources and come up with a   story that I thought made sense . The problem was telling that story to people   that were not familiar with that area and start with an introduction , intrigue   and conclusion , instead of directly going to my conclusion . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 After taking this course I realized how important is to tell the story the right way   and to know your audience , since you need to talk on the right concepts ,   background facts and organize all the variables in way that people can   possibly contribute on alternate solutions . Most of all , I ’m all about sharing my   passion and how exciting is to change all those variables in the extrusion   process to be able to make an extraordinary product , but I need to organize   my ideas , organize my story and create moments of reflection on my   audience . 

 Next time I will apply all I learned from storytelling and incorporate more and   more visualization for my audience , since making an abstract idea more   public and concrete is key to create a cause and have people to be more   involved in your passion and your business .

"PEER GRADED ASSIGNMENT 

 Title : Application of Learning Launch to experiment Online Tests and 

 Assessments in COVID19 environment . 

 <ADDRESS> by : <NAME> <NAME> 

 Reflection - Learning Launch 

 Challenge : 

 I am a professor working in a technical higher education institution in <ADDRESS> . The prevailing   mode of learning and assessment was predominantly within in the precincts of classroom and   laboratories in a physical environment . However , the students and faculty members are   acquainted with online mode for quiz assessment only . But the online quiz assessment was   taking place in the computer centre ’s in the institution as per the predefined schedule . The course   instructors were assigned for physical monitoring of the quiz conduction . With the sudden   emergence of COVID 19 pandemic , the Government ’s initiative for series of lockdowns has   necessitated the closure of technical higher education institutions in the State . To engage the   students in online mode and to make sure that they do n’t lose connect with the academics , the   institution has decided to offer online sessions and online assessments . This provided an   opportunity and challenge to both the stakeholders . The normal classroom sessions were held   using different open source platforms as per the choice and compatibility levels of instructors   and students . The students were also guided in doing their assignments and posting them to the   instructors successfully for assessment . However , the challenge aroused for both the stake   holders when the institution decided to conduct open ended quiz and descriptive exams by   allowing the students to sit in the comforts of home environment . It was also decided to leverage   a standardized common platform across the institution for the conduction of the same . 

 Selection : 

 The nuances of above challenge can be understood by applying an experimentation tool among   the stakeholders on prototype or mock basis . Based on the review of course content on Design   Thinking , it was decided to use the tool of Learning Launch as it is felt appropriate to conduct   experimentation among the stake holders and unearth the experiences . These experiences can in   turn serve as basis for refining the solution idea to the problem or completely think of a new idea   solution . The reason behind selecting <NAME> <NAME> is that it helps in figuring out what   customers/ stake holders/ students and faculty members need . It helps in unfolding the reality   faster and cheaper . Also lot of data can be generated in terms of experiences from both the   students and faculty members . By generating huge amounts of qualitative and quantitative data , 

 the tool can help us in protecting from confirming bias , which is common feature amongst the   individuals . Finally the tool helps in <ADDRESS> and learning philosophy , which is the core of   customer centric solution . 

 Application : 

 The tool was applied to understand the experiences of the user groups . The faculty members   were given virtual training in designing the question bank for open ended assessments . Online   videos and materials were provided to the instructors to enable they understand the essence of   open ended examination . Sample question papers were set by faculty members and online   interactive sessions were held with the instructors experienced in open ended assessments . This   enabled the instructors to experience the setting of questions for open ended tests . 

 The second level included interaction between the instructors and students involving the   instructors giving guidance to students . The guidance was pertaining to the interpretation and   understanding the process of open ended examination . Sample questions were given as   assignments to the students and this was followed by interactive sessions to clear any   apprehensions about the proposed format .In certain cases , the queries were recorded and   provided with clarification through various online interactive plat forms . 

 The third level involved virtual hands on training for the faculty members to make them   acquainted with the creation and uploading of question papers on to the platform along with   setting up of certain security controls . This phase invoked lot of queries from the faculty   members in using the tool . 

 The fourth level comprised of preparing standard operating procedures for both the faculty and   students highlighting the do ’s and do nt ’s during the examination . 

 The fifth level involved administration of mock online test to the students . This test ensured   confidence among the students and instructors . About 10 % of the students sought clarifications . 

 The sixth stage was focused on clearing the doubts posed by the students based on the mock   experience . 

 Insight : 

 Application of Learning Launch tool enabled to test the assumptions . This opened about various   issues such as obtaining the correct key by the student , network issues , scanning of the answer   sheets and uploading issues . 

 Some students do not possess the prescribed material as they left the material in dorms while   leaving to their native places . This necessitates them to access online material . However , the tool   does not allow the students to browse the information online as the minimization of screen will   lock the exam screen . This requires obtaining separate key from the administrator after 

 authentication from the students , mentor . This eats away students ’ allotted time . This in a way   defeats the objective of open book examination and assessment . 

 Approach : 

 Based on the insights from the application of the tool , the team came up with few ideas to   supplement the designed process and make it more effective . The ideas include suggesting the   students to open the examination in one desktop , laptop , tablet or smart phone and supplement it   with one more device of their choice mentioned earlier . The supplementary device can be used to   browse and access the material on real time basis during the examination . 

 A revised standard operating procedure is drafted and circulated to the students in accordance   with the insights gained from conducting these experiments using the Learning Launch tool .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a member of the recruitment and onboarding team of a major company , I was in   charge of the successful onboarding of some new hires who would eventually join in   two months . Normally this is a pretty standard work , but we had gotten feedback that   the process was lackluster , and the content heavy format tended to disenchant people .   The program was to familiarize the hires with the company ’s mission , vision and   processes , and carryout initial engagement practices . 

 So , I was looking to ramp up the engagement part and after going through design   thinking decided to put to use the storytelling tool . The aim was to weave narratives to   make the hires invest their emotions in the messages . I wanted to get them emotionally   invested to match their expectations , build rapport , surprise them and leave positive ,   lasting impressions , while keeping them engaged . 

 Application 

 As a starting point , we used visual storytelling to create a fictional hire ( Let ’s say X ) ,   and map his journey through onboarding , induction and a couple of months into the   job . This contained the many processes X would have to go through , the general   queries that may arise , how to navigate uncertainties , etc . While I could have skipped   this one , it was more realistic , more consistent and gave the new hires something to   relate to . 

 Series of graphic videos were created to tell the story of the company , products with   inputs from the top management as well as employees to give a virtual experience of   the company . It helped to see the bigger picture . We also asked the new hires to use   storytelling tool to tell their journey till the point of joining the company . Surveys were   carried out , which tried to gauge the feelings and emotions of the recruits with respect   to the company . 

 Insight & Approach 

 By using storytelling , we were able to put ourselves in our customers ( new hires ) shoes   and find the best experience that we could give them during this period , while trying   to maximize organizational orientation . It gave a clean structure and concrete goals of   that structure . It combined the power of creativity together with the need of analytical   thinking . Our actual results post this was that the new hires showed more interest in   the onboarding process and better organizational orientation post joining . Hence , we   are now incorporating and finding alternate ways to ramp up the engagement process 

 From being a technical person to using design thinking and creativity opens up   possibilities for solving problems that focuses on asking questions and listening , with   empathy , to the needs of our customers . This will enable good understanding of all the   people involved and catering to those needs while furthering organization goals . 

"
"Introduction 

 Myself , <NAME> , here is to submit my assignment i.e. , challenge of my 

 choice which could be solved by the design thinking tool “ Mind Mapping ” . 

 Myself as an author , I am going to say here a challenge I would face 

 when I own a organic products shop business . 

 Challenge 

 Entering into our main head ‘ challenge ’ , I clearly define the thing 

 that I found to be challenging is ATTRACTING COMMON PUBLIC . 

 Investment will be the first challenge that every business people face and 

 a common human knows that without investment there will be no 

 businesses . After crossing it the basic thing of a business remains 

 customer attraction and reputation . I feel hard to get attention of people 

 and I think it would not be solved soon . 

 Selection of Tool 

 Mind Mapping is a great design thinking tool ... 

  I choose online media platform for delivery of organic products for customer needs ... 

  Impress the customer by my own ideas ... for example saplings distribution ... 

  Give compact look to the shop ... for example decorate with greenery and cosy Shoba ... 

  Advertising the products may reach the customers easily ... 

 Application of Tools 

 I would decide to go with online platforms . Making my products that is pure naturally 

 handmade products ..... visible to customers residing in various geographical location through various online platforms is all I would do first . And I would also offers and discounts for my customer which will help my business sustain for a long period .... and customer recommend offering saplings to all customers .... sociatal may consider the organic products . 

 Insight 

 saying about insight , I am sure that with the above tool , my business would shine . Execution 

 of even a little thing in a business must be effective . And I earn more profit of the business . And so through online my business would gain more customers . By mind mapping I gained practical creativity and productivity to develop my business . 

 Approach 

 As usual customer always needs offers manually , that it might works 

 smoothly . Advertisement helps us to make more profitability in the business . I think it indirectly includes the other tool VISUALISATION.I visualise the benefits and everything that my business gon na face and created my mapping . some information like problems in online marketing , not every reviews of customers are considerable , believing intermediates in delivering process ... 

 Conclusion 

 This mind mapping gives me to develop my business successfully and very easy to 

 maintain all the above instructions . Design thinking and innovating the business willlead to better performancebof the carrier life .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared 

 understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify   and define possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our customers , who are   government agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery   of their services to their customer , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens , businesses , and non - citizens . I have used   the technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts   for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining   the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying   pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions .     Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw 

 man graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The   existing material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials ,   GAO or other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one- three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative . 

 If appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous 

 research , and discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage   approach helps to reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with   whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the   service . The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain   Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO , labor   unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization operates .   The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the Internet . If   the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual , either based on   a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders , or another format . 

 For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a 

 different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man graphic   that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three questions to   answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you change about   the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights do you have   about the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I give them approximately 20 minutes   to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have each group report out on their answers to   those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As each group reports out , I record   commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional insights that come from the group   discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an   artifact , create a view that combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion , and then   create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a   group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic – 

 especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the   shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to   share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they   could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump   starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are   missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of   taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps them   to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide the   values for the variables . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I 

 would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the   revised graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the   remainder of their work .

"<NAME> <NAME>             29 December 2020 

 MIND MAPPING 

 1 . CHALLENGE 

 I was asked to co - facilitate a design thinking workshop within the Digital &   Technology Sector of our organisation a few months ago , during the second wave of   the pandemic in my country . Our organisation recommended all staff to work   remotely , thus our workshop had to adapt to a virtual environment which was new   to not only the facilitators but participants . The intention of the design thinking   workshop was to solicit user stories from all project managers and business analysts   in the sector on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in all   areas of the organization . Our Chief Information Officer suggested that a horizontal   approach would allow efficiency gains in the in - house development or procurement   of a solution that caters for the organisation ’s needs . Our team of two facilitators   alongside the lead project team managers regrouped virtually to decide on the best   approach to conduct the virtual design thinking workshop and discussed various   tools , methods and platform to collaboratively gather user stories for a group of 30   participants . 

 2 . SELECTION 

 After much discussion on the agenda and main objectives of the design thinking   workshop , our team of facilitators felt comfortable with selecting the mind map   method as the method to gather user stories . According to Wikipedia , a mind map is   a   diagram used to visually organize information . It is hierarchical and shows   relationships among pieces of the whole , created around a single concept , drawn as an   image in the center of a blank page . Major ideas are connected directly to the central   concept , and other ideas branch out from those major ideas . 

 Having participated in a global design thinking workshop , I proposed <NAME> as the mind   map platform as it catered to multi - user collaboration in conjunction with Microsoft   Teams as the meeting platform . 

 3 . APPLICATION 

 I volunteered to design the mind map to fit to the objective of collecting user stories   from participants . Centrally , I overlaid the mind map with an image of a neutral network   representing the human brain symbolic to artificial intelligence . At the top of the canvas ,   I placed visuals to remind participants what user stories are , which are personas that we   want to gather with use cases for each department across the organization . 

 Each branch connected to the central concept referenced a sector in our organisation   and its branches referenced specific types of staff in those sectors . For example , within 

 the administration department , there were three sub - branches representing a staff filing   for claims , the claims processing officer , and the finance officer disbursing the funds . We   then got each participant to pen down how artificial intelligence and machine learning   could improve each user story , essentially a wishlist . A staff would want their claims to   be automated through a mobile app by taking snapshots of the parking receipts , a claims   processing officer would want the web app to assist with approving whitelisted claims   and only highlighting exception cases , and the finance officer would want to only   perform an audit only on accounts that breached authorised limits . 

 4 . INSIGHT 

 <NAME> map was applied effectively in the 1 hour workshop whereby participants were   split according to their assigned portfolios and collaborated to mind map each user   story . At the end of the workshop , us facilitators recapped and debriefed each user story   to all participants . 

 Feedback given to us facilitators was positive whereby participants did not feel fatigued   as they could take their time to pen down ideas . This workshop managed to gather close   to 70 unique user stories and these were all big ideas that had not been filtered to see   ‘ What Works ’ because our CIO wanted us to think big ! Because participants were asked   to empathize with the personas rather than themselves , as a staff in the IT sector , user   experiences were captured well in the mind map . Miro ’s interactivity of the canvas   whereby we could all see every participants cursor on the browser helped with keeping   energy levels high as it was a fun and de - stressing activity for all . 

 5 . APPROACH 

 Next time , I would spend more effort in designing the layout of the mind map that allows   for greater intuition from a participants perspective on what is required from them . For   instance , I would display an example user story that has been mind - mapped at the start   of the exercise . Additionally , I would recommend all participants to have their videos   turned on to keep to the collaborative spirit in a virtual design thinking process even if it   means using a secondary mobile device as the video camera . I would also have a debrief   among facilitators to get their views on the effectiveness of the mind map tool in meeting   the objective of gathering user stories because Miro had difficulties exporting data into   CSV from mind maps .

"Grabbing New Starter Market in Bangladesh Using Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 <ADDRESS> is a developing country with lots of population . The GDP is rising and also the per   capita income . People are having a high lifestyle in <ADDRESS> city . The food market has changed and   it became a lifestyle . Under my supervision , I launched Premium Experience Starters from Alpha   Catering . We were the first company to launch such food items and we faced a new challenge to   sell it to customers who never saw such one bite finger foods . For doing that , I choose   Storytelling . My clients are basically concerned about their name and fame . When they host a   party , they make sure that it becomes the talk of the town . To make them understand that people   will love the décor of the food along with the taste , I designed the storytelling tools for my   company . 

 Application 

 I designed my meeting documents using the pictures of foods and some imaginary characters   who were benefited by the purchase decision they did for their house / corporate parties .   The   stories represented a corporate whose boss was happy after the party due to the exceptional   foods presented at the party . There was also a story about a wedding which remained the talk of   the town by the exceptional presentation of the foods which no one ever did in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> before .   The stories were presented at the beginning and then the menu at the end . Such stories helped   me to create a rapport with my clients . They also shared their viewpoints after listening to the   stories I present . My main goal is to convince them for a demo . These demo is the main attraction   for a happy ending of a story . The presentation and taste of the demo help me to close the sale .   The price never ever mattered after such storytelling approaches . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The first communication medium for storytelling to my clients is email . Till now I got 96 % positive   response from this part . Then I set a face to face meeting where I can present my story physically .   Here I get insights about customers ’ perception . I continuously keep changing my approach by   getting these insights from customers during my meetings . 

 This course also helped me to look into this storytelling in a new way . My preparation for next   meeting will be much better and policies will be stronger . The conversion rate will be increased   too . 

 <NAME> does n’t end after closing the sale . I also keep in touch with the customers and get   feedbacks . These feedbacks are added to my stories where I use real facts , data and insights .

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 While I was quite curious to try out the different tools of the course , the first tool   I ended up using & being a part of the execution phase was mind mapping . With a   directive to improve the team ’s overall health score , we were pushed to pull all   punches to improve the experience of everyone in the team , as they work on   multiple projects across different geographies . With multiple domains & levels of   the organization at place , it was necessary to get everyone under a single room to   record the overarching pluses , negatives & changes that could be made in the   daily workings to finally increase productivity . 

 Application 

 Being part of the team , I was an active part of this exercise that saw every   member in the team , taking time off to share the positives , negatives and changes   possible in an overarching team & project management standpoint to improve   the experiences of every single member in the team . The post - its used to record   the points were then categorized to arrive at some important factors that   required our attention , with the post - its in their member communicating the   scale & the range communicated through the different perspectives provided by   each of them . Though we are a huge team , considering we were all working in a   similar system , the number of outliers were quite less & most of the post - its   contributed to the major factors identified . The post - its based on the factors   identified were put up on boards for everyone ’s consumption , discussed upon to   capture the overall reaction to the factors that had emerged . In my opinion , this   was a great initiative to capture the ‘ what - is ’ of the situation . 

 To arrive at functional changes that can be made by gathering the ‘ what - is ’ data   of the situation , all the stakeholders were split into multiple groups and were   asked to brainstorm on the changes that can be made to effectively change the   situation in a way , it makes our lives better . The changes prescribed by the team   members in the data gathering phase , also helped to drive to possible solutions . I   would like to also highlight that , no ground - breaking solutions were arrived at , yet 

 small functional & implementable solutions that can be experimented upon were   zeroed in on . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The power of the insights got from the exercise comes from the active   participation of the members of the team to improve their own eco - system at   work . It also helped to understand the various perspectives & ranges of issues   experienced by the ‘ minds ’ in the team , than a localized set of ‘ minds ’ higher up   in the organization . 

 But there are a couple of areas where I believe the exercise hit a couple of   roadblocks . Firstly , since members from different levels of the organization were   present in the session , there were 1 - 2 factors that appeared in both the positive   as well as negative boards . Also , ultimately to make a functional change in the   eco - system , for some factors , it was necessary to know at what level of the   organization was this issue a concern & how it could be suitably addressed . 

 Further , if we were to run a similar exercise , adding questions that employ   projective technique like word / image association to the process would be a good   idea , as usually it is noticed that there are many underlying aspects of the   experience that is lost in the daily motion .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection   The first tool I used was Visualization to identify and define the problem that we had to   tackle in the contest in which we were participating with my colleagues from the   university . The topic to be discussed was informal trade . We use the straw man   visualization technique with a series of questions or proposals to discuss among the   members of the group and in this way learn from each other and identify improvements   or solutions .    Application   The contest was held at the time of the pandemic , so the meetings had to be virtual , so   we had to use programs like Miro to be able to interact together . We start the process   by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the Straw man   graphic , we used the information we had collected on the subject , such as statistics on   informal trade , history of the steps taken by municipalities to solve the problem ,   interviews with informal merchants . In the Straw man I included a column to define the   direct and indirect actors , each member represents an area of interest and in the Miro   a graph was placed for each member . In the Miro they could place pictures and answer   the following questions   1 ) What points are missing from the graph ?   2 ) What would you add to the graph ?   3 ) What knowledge do you have about the subject ?   4 ) How do you think the mentioned actors are involved ?   Each member has 25 minutes to answer these questions . Once the work is completed ,   each member explains their answers , the answers are recorded together and then a   group discussion is created to see what is added or removed from the Straw man   graphic . 

 Insight & Approach   What you learned from doing this activity is that it helps us understand each   participant 's point of view and you can see different perspectives on the same topic or   problem addressed . However , even though there are many points of view , an   agreement can be reached and the problem to be faced can be defined . It also helps to   develop a much more effusive discussion in which everyone participates and in which   everyone can share their knowledge . It really is a very good method of identifying the   problem .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling ( Design Tool ) 

 Low Percentage of Graduates Employment – Sanella 

 Submitted on : 17th April 2020   Submitted by :   <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> 

 I am a staff member in Strategy team at Sanella which is one of the leading federal higher   educational institutions in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> .   Part of annual strategic performance measuring is to track certain number of KPIs ( Key Performance   Indicators ) and OPIs ( Operational Performance Indicators ) by extracting , calculating , validating and   verifying the results achieved along with comprehensive examination to the supporting docs and row data   submitted accordingly .    It is noticed that the KPI argued of % Graduates Employment in 12 months where Sanella keeps   scoring poorly and low ( less than 30 % ) despite all the efforts / plans made is reflecting negatively on the   image of the federal institution and damages the reputation of its graduates at the local jobs market .    Hence ; it has been decided to uncover the reasons and discover elements behind slow achievement and   low rates of graduates ’ employment by considering some elements via conducting the tool of storytelling .      Selection 

 The design thinking tool chosen of DT box is “ Storytelling ” simply because it puts human experience front   and center knowing that we ’re dealing with graduates in this example .   We lean heavily on this tool to   support exploring reasons of low rates of employment among the university ’s graduates .   This selection is also meant to deeply utilize emotional connections and to know the audience further .     Application 

 Alumni from the same university was invited to conduct a storytelling session since the storyteller was   once in the same position as the graduates concerned which is anticipated to provide refined   understanding and deep analysis toward their issues , feelings , thoughts and career setback .   During storytelling the level frustration caused by un employment was well discussed to establish two side   communications linkage and to create bonding moments with audience .     A story about a graduate who spent years at home struggling to find a suitable job was told in an   interesting way to have the audience engaged . Additionally ; some questions remained unanswered to   build a level of suspense .   The clear sequence of event was logical to navigate audience that eventually   the Alumni in the story found a job at the private sector although a career at government sector was   initially targeted .   The ultimate finding was discovering alternative areas for career success and   advancement . Moreover ; the audience similarly interacted and presented their moments of tension and   pain .    The storytelling as a design thinking tool helped all to get the same awareness and understanding   of the problem discussed where all looks forward to solving it . 

 Insight 

 By applying the tool of storytelling and via involvement / engagement of audience the impact and outcome   was significant .   The audience came to find that many job contracts at private sectors and banking sectors were declined   since graduates believed working at the government sector comes first .    This was the main reason of low rate of employment among graduates of Sanella .   The pursue / seeking of jobs at only one sector did n’t improve previous results of graduates ’ employment .   But the storytelling tool supported shedding light on different career paths to be pursued to minimize   unemployment rates .    Future wise ; incorporating this design thinking tool to tackle the percentage of graduates ’ contracts   offering will be tracked and closely observed to study how well utilized the tool is in a certain timeframe   ( 12 months ) .      Approach 

 The tool used here is found suitable to capture direct insight of audience and to provide answers to   relevant questions .   The design of the tool led to satisfactory solution of a traditional problem .   Also , the storytelling in this example made an excellent reflection by transforming the employment   strategy to become live , practical , characteristic and personalized .     If time allows it other alternative approaches would have been considered as well such as : 

 •   Ethnographic Interviews : because this tool would have given a reality sense , genuine feel of   graduates ’ life , career hopes and unarticulated needs .   This tool would have also provided deep insights of the issue argued . 

 •   Brainstorming : this tool would have been conducted not on the traditional way .    It would contain structured techniques , triggered questions , collaborative ideas , multiple rounds   of silent writing ideas that is shared by all to tackle the problem of poor rates in relation to   graduates ’ employment .

"Reflection – Learning Launch     I do not have a challenge where I can apply this new knowledge on “ live ” at this time so I will   describe a challenge which I had before attending “ Design Thinking for Innovation ” course   and do a retrospective that , based on the knowledge gained from the course .      Challenge :    COVID-19 struck in February 2020 and there where a lock down and requirements for social   distancing at our company , just as in most other places . As time passed , we started to think   about how the returning to the office might be – would it be safe , how many people could   be at one location , how do we ensure that we could return to office in a safe way and   maintain social distance . My team , a group of eight people , was involved in the task to find a   way to do this . Could we create something that will help us plan the return in a safe way ?     Selection :   The group I work in is an innovation lab which do experiments with new technologies yet   used within our company . We are familiar with and using all the four tools or methods   mentioned in the assignment - Visualization , Storytelling , Mind mapping and Learning   Launch ( we use the term pilot at our company ) . For this challenge we used mostly   Visualization and Learning Launch1 . We use Visualization as one way to create greater   understanding of the subject area and drill down into details , but in this reflection I will only   describe the way we used <NAME> <NAME> . The development of the experiment was limited   to my group ’s resources , so we needed a way to continuously validate , further develop or   freeze the experiment . <NAME> <NAME> was a way for us to be able to use scarce resources   effectively . We needed users , which had limited time , to test our prototype to enable us to   quickly gain new knowledge and iterate the idea to see if it worked .      Application :   The approach we came up with after an initial ideation was to create a custom iPhone app .   As we work with fast experiments , we needed to test what functionality works for the users   and what does n’t . We also needed to evaluate the technology solution . We created a   prototype within two weeks together with our stakeholder ’s - workplace related services   and HR . We started a number of short continuous learning launches . The first learning   launch was based on an app where the users should check in manually and the app   visualised presence in the building . The prototype was more of a walking skeleton with few   features and we deployed the app to selected people in our vicinity . After looking at the   result and usage we soon realized that manual check - in was not the way to go – it was not a   user - friendly solution , the users forgot or did n’t check in and out - but the idea with an app   was still possible to further explore , so we needed automation . As my group had existed for   a couple of years , and had done quite a few technical experiments , we looked back and one   of the experiments related to near field sensors . That   experiment had been frozen , but we decided to return to   it and try the technology for this challenge .      In the next learning launch we had implemented sensors   which the app could register to a database though an API . 

 1 Learning Launch Tool ( <URL> ) 

 We had selected a few users on different office floors in the building . The users would   automatically be checked in while passing a sensor . We tried different kinds of sensors and   after feedback and looking at the results we found a way to designing a technical solution   with IoT beacons . The test became more effective because the users did not have to spend   time testing , just carry around their phone . We also learned that we had to put additional   check - out sensors in certain common places that people used to leave the office space to   keep correct counting .      During the third learning and final learning launch we gained feedback from users that a   planning tool also was needed . So , we created the possibility to pre - schedule planned   presence in the office building for up to two weeks , enabling users to see planned presence   and decide if it was appropriate to go to an office space a specific time . The final app was   implemented on all our colleagues work phones and is in use since late 2020 .     Insight :   Learning launches - pilots2 as we call them , are very useful to try different experiments on   real users and other stakeholders . In the course I gained a more comprehensive view of   <NAME> <NAME> , at the time I had n’t attended this course but appreciated the method as   we used it . Now I ’m realizing what potential strength this tool has , especially in combination   with the other tools mentioned in the course .   Parts that we did n’t use - such as metrics   during the learning launches would be really useful . To ask questions like “ Under what   circumstances would this be a bad idea ” , “ Will the customer buy this ? ” etc . could be really   valuable . I think we had some of the parts as mentioned in the course , we learned and   iterated to create a solution that could meet the goal , we did it through small , fast   experiments and a fail - fast approach and evaluated if we should continue or drop the   experiment .      Approach :   Looking back , I realize we already used lots of tools and methods within design thinking but   in a more ad - hoc manner rather than as a flow . I think that the way design thinking works is   a well thought context of things , that by themselves are useful , but when used together   makes greater impact . I would definitely use term <NAME> <NAME> going forward instead of   pilot , but with the knowledge gained now I will do them more structured and well thought   out – not in an ad - hoc manner . This goes for the other tools within design thinking as well . I   have used visualization , describing the challenge , created customer journeys etc . I have   used storytelling to sell ideas or explaining - but I have not made a challenge into a cause ,   that is new to me and I find it extremely powerful and useful to drive change and gain   insights . I will definitely use design thinking and add the knowledge in this course to the   tools going forward . 

 2 The term pilot according to the course is more of a go - no go decision ( “ We prefer the term learning launch to the term pilot ” , IBM Story 10.38 )

"Reflection : Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I was working on a project for a <ADDRESS> company , where we were setting up their customer   experience department . The plan was setting different surveys on points of the customer   journey hoping to gather enough information to evaluate the opinions of the clients . 

 So we used the storytelling tool to figure out how to best set the surveys and which questions   were better for the different points of interaction of the customer . This way , we would   position ourselves on the skin of a customer in their journey from their first contact with the   company , until the day they decided to leave . 

 Application 

 Thanks to the storytelling tool and everyone experience with their own telecom company , we   started narrating the journey of a customer . Starting by the moment set client goes to one of   our shops asking for the offers available , or when calling the telesales department . Getting   ourselves in the skin of the customer , we could figure out what kind of experience they had ,   and then , set the questions for the survey related to that point appropriately . We followed this   procedure for the whole journey , going from the sales to installation of fixed networks at   home , to calls trying to solve issues related to devices or invoices , until reaching the end of the   journey , when the customer leaves , setting questions trying to figure out the reasons behind . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The tool was really useful setting up the questions , and also in the future , it keeps being useful   once trying to analyse the results on the surveys , because the tool allows us also to look for   the story behind the reasons for which the customers vote one way or another . 

 I feel like this was the best tool to set up this kind of process allowing us to consider every path   a customer will take during it ’s time with the company .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge     My challenge is that I used to think a lot about what I am going to do , and I base my decisions   on things I do n’t know if are correct , also I have a lot of ideas , but the problem is that I do n’t   know how to test those ideas to know if they can function . A few years ago , I had to do a   project for a class at my school , and I had many different ideas about what to do . When I   chose my first topic the professor told me that was a good topic but maybe it was not the   best , so I decided to ignore my professor and keep working on the topic , I do that because   I thought that the topic was the easiest . I was wrong , everything starts going very difficult   because there was n’t much information about the topic , so I start moving my idea with other   wrong ideas , at this point , I decide to change my topic to another new one .      Selection      The tool I chose was the learning Launch tool . This tool in doing small experiments to prove   our idea in the real world , we learn and we improve . I started to make experiments with my   new topic , like how hard will be to get information , what the professor thinks about my new   topic , and how easy was for me to expose it . The experiment was cheap , basically was free ,   I search for information on the internet , in the library of my school , or whit my professor , and   was fast , I dedicate two hours or three per day , I did a lot of experiments whit different topics   because it was free and fast , the results help me to modify my ideas or throw it away , I was   learning and improving on my project .        Application      I start to identify my problem ; my topic was a little bit hard , so what I made first was to search   for information about topics , I made a list with the most interesting topics and the easiest   ones , what I do next asked my professor If my new options were correct , he helps to choose   the best topics and at the end , I have 3 different options , I start working on the three topics   while I was working I also show my project to my friends , classmates and my professor , they   give me their opinion about what they think was the best topic , and at the end , I have my   final topic .       So actually what I did was to help myself to choose a better topic , so what I did was a list   about topics that comply with two characteristics , that was interesting , that the information   about the topic was easy to get , my next step was to ask about the best of all my topics , and   when I finally have the three topics I started to test those topics with the people that are   going to judge my project , at the end I have my final topic .       Insight      The insights I get was about how to choose the best decisions and how to improve my ideas   to get the best one , doing different experiments to get information that helps me to improve   my ideas or to throw them away and focus on other ideas , my challenge at the beginning   was hard because I do n’t know what other topic chose , but with this tool , the challenge   became an easy one , since that moment I start to do that kind of things when I do n’t know   what I must do , this helps me to get more information to make better decisions not just in   my school also in my life . 

 Approach                                                                                                                                                         Honestly , since this moment I will start to use more the mind mapping tool . I think that tool   mixed with the learning launch tool can facilitate the search for information , and visualize it   in a better way , that help me to make better decisions .

"Example Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 We are a sales team who work IT projects with Government Sector , and I am Team Manager   assistant . Our main challenge is to improve workflow / workload within the sales and presales   team into more efficient way ; in order to increase sales , and expand our team size for the future .   Our team currently has 10 members , including sales and sales assistants , plus 3 presales .   While being as an IT solution company , we always come across with the newest IT gadgets   and/or applications as well as technologies . This also brings us to one of our biggest concerns ;   while we have a lot of flexibility on procedures for individual sales to fit their needs , this also   causes us lacking the ability to synchronize workflow / workload balance between sales as well   as with presales . There are fragments of new leads information , on process projects that needs   to close deals , project coordination etc . Although we understand that there should be some   certain IT applications / solutions could help us to solve the team ’s concerns , I believe that we   should handle our concerns in a more design thinking way . This project shall not exceed 60   working days and shall include work hours from interviews , possibly workshops , and solution   tryouts amongst with whole sales and presales team . There is not a strict deadline date for this   project , due to limitations of team members ’ time availability for interviews and check point   reviews . 

 Selection 

 As being very beginning stage of using design thinking way trying out to solve our challenge , the   solution I am trying out is <NAME> - mapping . This tool would help me to better empathize and   understand teammates ’ situations and their challenges as well as their preference work styles   during interviews . 

 Application 

 The first step we did was conduct different types of meetings , both within sales team and   pre - sales team . As the meetings flow , we made some bullet points like mind mapping from each   individual ’s duties , challenges , concerns , from as broad as between different teams to as   narrow as individual daily work flow . We specially focused on how they feel on their current   duties and what causes their pain points . Although we always wanted to jump to looking for a   solution to fix each of their concerns , we kept reminding ourselves that we should be more open   minded to dig deeper for the true causes of the concerns . After a few small group meetings and   1 - on-1 interviews , we gathered different lists on data for analysis stage . The Mind Mapping tool   effectively helped us to better visualize and cross checking between individual ’s pros and cons   for similarity and differences . 

 Insight 

 By using <NAME> <NAME> tool , we found some common concerns between teams and also within   teams . Moreover , this tool also helps us to categorize / prioritize levels for all pain points and   challenges . For example , lack of regular communication is one of the biggest causes of project   getting stuck in a certain stage . However , lack of communication is just an easy conclusion for   these concerns , while the main challenge is actually that the unbalanced workload between two   teams . This tool helps us to see gaps in between challenges and create open spaces for us to   dig deeper to understand more individually . With all the comments in front of us , experiments   samples become easier to pick for testing solutions . 

 Approach 

 Mind Mapping is a well pick tool for this project . Starting from gathering information , when we   are only taking notes on multiple individuals general comments up until we do the 1 - on-1   interviews . We found differences and similarities of pros and cons . Although at a certain point   that we feel that we have too much information on our hands . This tool helps us best with cross   comparing between comments for similarities and conflicts . This tool also help us to see better   for balancing out to seek compromise . For next meetings , we should check point for both teams   and individuals to reflect on the solutions , comments about what works and what not . Then align   to new experiments if neccessary .

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of the organization ’s product development team . We are a multinational company from   the textile industry , and our challenge is to grow the sales of our line products . P&D works closely with   the Sales team , which brings us the feedback from our B2B customers , with our Trade Marketing   department , which brings us the feedback and information from the market , and the industrial   development team at the industrial plant .     The company spent a few months in a process of mind set and cultural change , when the employees   were trained in agile methodologies , to use them as new tools for the developments of the new product   process , and also solve problems in which the company has found difficulty . 

 Selection     After the training our team has already followed up with some parts of the "" What Is "" ( Journey   Mapping , Value Chain Analysis ) , and now we have reached the stage of <NAME> <NAME> , which is why I   choose this tool for reflection .     Application     First , we chose a large room in the office . Then we paste all the data that we collected during the   previous phases on the walls . We gathered a group of twenty people from the areas of sales , trade   marketing , product development and industrial , so they could look at it . Gradually everyone made   observations , and we followed the processes of insights formation and clustered the data so we could   proceed with brainstorming .     Insight     After the use of mind mapping , we could perceive a series of links and patterns among the interviewees ,   and in this way , it was possible to observe some problems and feelings of the consumers that we did n’t   know before . Because of this process it was possible to reach the stage of brainstorming much more   prepared to develop a solution that fits the consumer better and adds more financial value to the   company .     Approach     For the next applications of mind mapping , I believe that what we will have different will be the   experience of having already carried out this process . All participants will already have changed their   mind set and understood the importance of design thinking , and the execution of this tool will already   be done in a more fluid way .

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In my job as a customer success associate , we encourage our clients to share with us their pain points so that we can recommend them better solutions using our platform . We offer business solutions to help our corporate and medium scale 

 enterprise clients monitor their team 's productivity level . One of our challenges is to get our clients to tell us their stories and share what they honestly think went wrong or right about their existing process . 

 I want to use the storytelling design thinking tool because it is one of the most appropriate for these scenarios . Besides , our team is already using it unknowingly , making greater sense to apply it officially on my job . 

 Application 

 Before presenting our services to our clients , our team usually makes a short pitch or story about how powerful our tool is . This sales pitch is just the first meeting out of a series of meetings that will dot our client 's entire customer journey with us . After the sales pitch , we let our clients walk us through their pain points . We have forms that they need to fill to submit their organizational pain points . We also use sticky notes sometimes for this activity . 

 After we have collated all their pain points , we asked them for some clarification about the inputs they 've submitted , and that 's where we let them start telling their story . Hearing their pain points coming directly from them makes it easier for us to understand and empathize . 

 Insight & Approach 

 We 've been using this process every time we had these meetings . The goal is to have the client talk and share their stories . After they 've shared their stories , that 's when we start showing the functions and features of our platform that can help them with their needs , making it more relatable and tailor - fit . I was just thinking that since we are using sticky notes sometimes , to improve our process further , we can also use the mind mapping design thinking tool . We can have our clients group similar concerns and let them debate over it . Allowing it a more interactive and immersive activity and though - sharing process .

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am a student and I would like to write about my experience in a club that I am a part of .   Entrepreneurship Cell , the club that I work for , nurture values and creates a start - up culture at my   university . We help start - ups grow and incubate through our club and conduct various sessions ,   events , and competitions to spread awareness and help elicit right ideas in minds of many . We host   “ Think - Tank ” session wherein club members are given an opportunity to present their ideas , discuss   ideas , or talk about any topic relevant in the entrepreneurial ecosystem . We have planned to make   these sessions public and give this opportunity to all the students , and faculty of our university . 

 Selection and Application 

 We decided to use the tool of <NAME> <NAME> to structure the learning experience of the club   members . <NAME> <NAME> allowed us to look for patterns and gain deeper insights . Before we started   <NAME> <NAME> , we questioned the members for relevant skills and learning goals that could prove   beneficiary while attending or presenting during the Think - Tank session . In the ongoing sessions we   asked for special feedback from the members on relevant topics they encounter during the sessions   and the challenges that they encounter , as in , the topics that they did not understand or had to look   up on the internet or elsewhere post the session . In questionnaires we gathered quantitative and   qualitative data . We asked for topics for discussions , wishes , inspiration , own experiences , etc . After   gathering this data from members , we clustered important topics for our different sessions , wrote   them down on paper . Every one of our club members received sticky notes and were asked to ideate   a little more on this change that we planned to incorporate , individually . Before we dug in , we   created a growth mindset by focusing on the question : “ What if anything were possible ? ” . Many   new ideas had emerged from this Design tool . We also kept a list of the outlier ideas as a source for   future inspiration . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 The Mind Mapping Tool allowed us to get a greater understanding of the Think - Tank sessions we   offer , how they connect and how a great learning transfer for club members and participants can be   reached . We broadened our repertoire by taking the participants perspective intensely and were   able to extend our program to meet the participants needs . We came up with some new blended   formats in which we added little quizzes and presentation inputs that accompany the students   during the semester or for courses they take on some topics . Another method for knowledge   transfer is that the participants write a reflection a few days after the session to reactivate their   take - away messages from the sessions . They are asked how they plan to use a tool or method of   building a start - up or a skill taught during the session . We also tried out many different online tools   for more methodological mix and online webinars and decided afterwards which ones worked best   ( from the club members and the participants experience and feedback ) . A special challenge was the   change to a completely digital format of our Think - Tank sessions because of Covid19 . Despite the   requirement to incorporate this change to our Think - Tank session , we still launched the ideas we   gathered and continuously use feedback rounds in the sessions to keep the iterative process going   and share newly gained knowledge within our team . The possibility of organizing and visualizing   through the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> allowed us to connect different stakeholders input and ideas and had a   big impact on our repertoire . For future design challenges I would use the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> again .   I would try to include the different stakeholders more intensely though by making them part of the   whole process .

 Example Reflection - Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 My name is <NAME> <NAME> . I am a mechanical engineer and my profession is heating and cooling system   designs . Moreover , I am a member of garment care department at my company . My challenge was   increasing ironing performance for handheld irons . It was my first iron project and I had not got   adequate information about this issue . 

 According to user experiment studies , every Turkish people want to wear ironed clothes . Wrinkled   textiles are not acceptable for them . For this reason , my department kicked off improve the ironing   performance of our irons . 

 There are two main parameters for improving ironing performance . First factor is steam rate and   second one is temperature of iron sole plate . If you increase steam rate and temperature of sole plate ,   you can improve your ironing score . 

 Selection 

 I checked design thinking tools and decided to use learning launch tool . In my point of view , this tool   is more useful for our challenge because I had lack of information about irons and the factor of ironing   performance . In addition , I had limited time for solving this problem . The learning launch given chance   for quick prototyping and test . 

 Application 

 At our first learning launch , we discussed above steam rate and sole plate temperature in order to   improve ironing performance . In consequence of first learning launch , we decided to modify sole plate   steam channels . At that point , we designed 3 alternative sole plate channels and asked ourselves “ How   do we decide which design is best ? ” In order to answering this question , we sent these 3 designs for   quick and cheap prototyping . 

 As a result of first tests with these three prototypes , we arranged second learning launch . We   evaluated test results and sole plates during this learning launch . Moreover , we choose best sole plate   channel alternative and improved the design of this alternative . We tested again with improved sole   plate . According to test results , our steam rate and sole plate temperature increased . 

 Sensitivity : Public 

 Insights 

 By applying the learning launch tool , we enhanced our knowledges about irons and produced some   prototypes and applied steam rate and sole plate temperature tests with these prototypes . After that ,   at second learning launch , we improved steam rate and sole plate temperature thanks to final steam   channel design . 

 Thanks to improve these parameters , our ironing performance dramatically increased . Our final ironing   performance test results were slightly different from our existing irons . 

 Approach 

 In brief , learning launch tool was best tool for solving problems , if you have insufficient problems . We   discussed with my team above this tool that will use at new research and development projects . What   is more , I discussed with other departments and explained learning launch tool to them . They may try   this tool for their projects . 

"
"The process begins with empathy , which includes engaging with those who will be   impacted by the design solution . These interactions are not interviews , but rather   conversations that help to provide insight . The second phase of the design thinking   process uses the information gathered from the community to define the problem .   Once the problem has been defined , an ideation session based on the design   prompt and the empathy feedback is used to think of a range of possibilities to   address the problem . After ideation , the top ideas from the session are prototyped   and then tested by the community , wherein the process can begin again to   streamline the solution . 

 Our challenge projects are just five short weeks , and we begin the process with a   design prompt already created . The word “ challenging ” is apt for more reasons that   one . Empathy is the most important and powerful piece of the process , but it can   be difficult to make the connections needed within the community to provide the   needed insights . It ’s important to start this process early , to be flexible and to be   persistent despite any failed attempts . Five weeks is also an incredibly short   amount of time to craft a solution or recommendation . 

 The design thinking framework is an ideal tool to create a human - centered solution ,   but it ’s important to recognize that design is not a linear process . Looping in and   out of the phases is normal and necessary . Design is messy , it ’s beautiful , it ’s   frustrating , it ’s rewarding and ultimately hard to tell when you ’ve reached a   conclusion . As fellows , we ’ve all been asked to step outside of our comfort zones ,   whether that is through learning new skills or through the “ yes , and … ” approach . 

 As we begin our final impact projects , I ’m grateful for the lessons I have learned   both from participating in these challenge projects and also from my fellow fellows .

"Presentation of e - mobility as a service via Visualization approach 

 Challenge 

 I am the head of a diverse group of people who belongs to an automotive industry and our challenge   as a team is to recommend and suggest   the board of directors of our organization to select in which   country amongst <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> and <ADDRESS> to initiate the   setup plans and invest in    the required   infrastructure to introduce the concept of e - mobility as a service . This process   involves lot of data inputs , interpretation and analysis . Our team is tasked to provide the best   analysis of the data and to finally conclude in which of the following countries it should be   implemented to benefit the organization . 

 Selection 

 Me and my team has already gone through various tools and selected   the tool of visualization   as   the best and efficient one to enlighten the board on the insights gathered by our team . 

 Application 

 For our presentation , we have used data in the form of bar graphs and   pie charts , as we are   handling and comparing various means , we have structured the various collected statistics with   which our team members   divided among themselves , first presented a sample charts   in order to   confirm that the presentation using this tool is convincing and effective . Upon diving further into   the project , we found out that adding the very famous SWOT analysis   ( Strength , Weakness ,   Oppurtunity and Threats )   along with our graphs will be an added feature and helps better   understanding of the same . 

 So our team consisting of 12 members , were divided into team of three , assigned with the task of   taking each country , segregating and putting up the numbers obtained in terms of geographic area   , ownership of vehicles , existing infrastructure , the age factor of people who can use e - mobility   etc . Finally the team was combined and the comparison graph was plotted and simultaneously   SWOT analysis was done at the end inferring all the collected data . 

 Insights and <NAME> 

 That was really a mind blowing , clear eye opener for our Board of directors during the presentation   , the visualization tool of   graphs , statistics and especially SWOT analysis done by our team gave   them clear idea , the strengths of each country and also with our special approach of seeing   weakness as oppurtunities based on facts were applauded and given special mention as well as our   aim of suggesting the best country to implement the service was made available clearly to the   organization . 

 Sometimes putting up all the numbers in the data in a piechart or graph is effective rather than   simply quoting it by telling . This approach gave myself a confidence that with the right tool   selected as in this case can easily convey our findings to a larger number of people .

"Reflection - Story Telling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 My choice is storytelling tool . I am actually interested in searching the problem   and knowing where they farmers feel discomfort and loss in business . I spend   my valuable time with them to open their hearts and to open up their feelings   and problems .My company produces fertilizers to improve quality of yield and   also quantity .     The most important thing to human is food.so when I go to field where the   farmers work and listen to their stories I can understand what pesticides or   fertilizers they need and their stories help us to new invention to solve the   problem of farmers and to produce good yield . I use their informative stories in    developing different strategies to try and find a way that works for them to   gain more   independence in the areas they find lacking in their lives . 

 APPLICATION 

 Many successful companies uses storey telling to capture the great achievement .   Storytelling in business focuses on the human side of work . Basically , it means   telling stories instead of just listing facts . Because just as I said earlier , good   stories engage better . They also stick longer in your audience ’s mind . An   example of successful company 

 The Canadian arm of the diaper brand , Huggies , knew that in order to compete with   Pampers ( the market - leader who , at the time , had 100 % of Canadian hospital   contracts ) , they needed to provide a tangible , emotional reason for mothers to   choose them before arriving at the hospital to give birth . 

 The answer turned out to be in their own name : hugs . 

 Rooted in over 600 studies that proved hugs “ help stabilize babies ’ vital signs , build   immune systems , ward off illness , and improve brain development ” , the brand went   on a mission to leave no baby unhugged . 

 The campaign hinged on two initiatives : 

 1 . Educate mothers on the importance of skin - to - skin contact with their 

 babies . 

 1 . Ensure that Canadian hospitals had volunteer ‘ huggers ’ available for babies in 

 need of hugs . 

 With sales soaring 30 % in 2016 and an engagement rate 300 % higher than industry   benchmarks , this philanthropically - spirited campaign proves the power of using   data to inform a story that resonates . 

 So like these we have gone through different problems and pain of farmers and   sorted out new various pesticides which are also so natural . it is very helped our   company to find new inventions 

 Insight & approach 

 For insight managers , the aim may be to persuade leaders to ‘ see things   differently ’ or ‘ do the right thing ’ , but insight is also used to support marketing   communication , in which case marketing communications specialists will ask   insight specialists , ‘ tell us about the stories that are in your customer data ’ .   You can translate insights about and from customers and partners into stories   for customers and also for front - line staff and others who manage customers   directly . These insights can be about many topics , such as moments of truth , or   being satisfied by service or problem management , such as successful   turnaround of complaints or claims . These are often called ‘ references ’ or ‘ case   studies ’ . Good ones are repeated again and again because they resonate . They   are more than just references . 

 By applying storey telling tool we reached our assumptions and need . We also   succeeded . For customers , a story can help them make the ‘ right ’ choice , be   more confident about making a decision or about a decision already made ,   reduce stress , understand the value to be obtained from a brand / product , or   give reasons to recommend to other customers . For frontline staff , the   benefits include feeling like a member of the team , understanding the   company culture or marketing / sales / service strategy better , being more   confident in or having better ideas about handling or motivating customers ,   achieving recognition ( through stories about staff ) , or connecting or working   better with staff in other functions / departments . But also we from storey it   helps us to invent more and more . 

 Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking   activities / tools and are at this stage in the timeline , the storey telling is the 

 appropriate tool . As previously mentioned , our team has gone so much   investigation.so our business improved a lot it helpful to farmers also .

"Final Assignment – Learning Launch 

 By <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 I work in the planning department of a transit company . My team has been tasked with the challenge of   dissecting and redesigning our current process of bus stop checks . Bus stop checks are done twice each   day by different employee for the purpose of inspecting the physical stop for possible damage or   updating the posted transit schedule . Currently , each driver drives a pre - determined route that is   provided by the planning department . The driver is given the route printed out on paper from an excel   document at the beginning of each shift . The driver then progresses through the route , inspecting each   site , and writing down their evaluation on a pad of forms . After the driver completes the route , they   submit the completed forms back to the planning department where the information is transferred to   an electronic document . 

 While brainstorming this current process , the main issues and inefficiencies were identified as : 

 •   Missing forms that either need to be searched for and located , or are never found   •   Potential data entering errors while transferring the information from paper to electronic   •   Transferring the data is time consuming 

 Selection 

 Throughout the brainstorming process , it was quickly identified that there were a couple steps in the   current process that were outdated and could be modernized . Technology has become an easily   obtainable and inexpensive tool that can be implemented in order to maximize efficiency and minimize   room for error . Based off that assumption , it was clear that the learning launch tool would work best for   our challenge as we try to introduce technology into the process . 

 Application 

 For our learning launch , we introduced two tablets to be picked up by the driver at the beginning of   each shift . Once the driver signs into the tablet with the provided credentials , the tablet opens a link to a   form similar to Google Forms . The form outlines the route for the driver to take . Under each stop   address are the appropriate fillable fields to allow the driver to enter and save their notes directly on the   route schedule before proceeding to the next stop . The driver can also now use the tablet to take   images and upload the image with their comments . After the driver saves their comments , they are   automatically uploaded to a spreadsheet on the company server that is monitored by the planning   department . 

 Insight 

 Our learning launch resulted exactly how our team expected it to . The removal of paper forms instantly   saved the driver the time spent on filling out the form and writing their comments . The driver only had   positive feedback on no longer having to fill out each stop information on paper , as well as being able to   select the majority of their responses from a pre - determined drop - down menu . 

 The automatic uploading of each form eliminated the risk for error for incomplete and missing forms .   The time previously spent transferring the form information was also removed from the process , saving   the company time and money . Going electronic is also more environmentally friendly . 

 As we continue to use our new process and gather driver feedback , we may need to update the online   form . However now changes can be made easily and quickly by the planning department , instead of   having to order new paper forms with each update . 

 Approach 

 We are confident the learning launch tool was the best tool to use for our challenge . It was clear to our   team from the beginning that technology would improve all the issues and inefficiencies identified in our   brainstorming phase . As stated previously , there may need to be some minor adjustments made as the   rollout of the new process returns more user feedback . We also anticipate using the learning launch tool   in the future as technology advances and more options become available .

"Visualisation is a core component of the way that we communicate , whether we 're aware of it or   not . When we 're dealing with very complex problems , we 're enacting a different kind of problem   solving that has to bring in more than just logic . Visualisation is really important for the process   of Design Thinking because it 's actually a way of unlocking a different part of our brain . It allows   us to think in a non - verbal way and access parts of our brain , our creativity . Most design thinkers   call visualisation as “ the mother of all design tools ” , because they are used in every stage of the   design thinking process .

Most design thinkers call visualisation as “ the mother of all design tools ” , because they   are used in every stage of the design thinking process . 

 Visualization is about using images . It ’s not about drawing ; it ’s about visual thinking . It pushes   us beyond using words or language alone . It is a way of unlocking a different part of our brains   that allows   us to think   nonverbally   and that managers might   not normally   use . 

 When you explain an idea using words , the rest of us will form our own mental pictures , usually   informed by our training . When you say , “ We need a new growth platform , ” the IT specialist sees   servers and code and the marketing guru sees an advertising campaign . If instead you present your   idea to us by drawing a picture of it , you reduce the possibility of unmatched mental models . 

 Visualisation is equal parts listening , thinking and drawing . Listening is the input , thinking is the   processing and drawing is the output . These three skills work together equally in understanding   complexity , visualising outcomes to create new possibilities . 

 Visualisation has a role to play throughout the Design Thinking . It 's an incredible tool , in that   sense , in that we 're using those tools and that part of our brain at each phase in the design process .   It 's not just something that has an application in one part of the Design Thinking . It has many ways   of being useful at different parts of the Design Thinking process . 

 When you get to concept development , Visualisation becomes incredibly useful . Your brain is   creating pictures of something that does n't yet exist . It 's creating pictures of something that will   soon be . As we move forward into prototyping , we get much more detailed in the way that we start   to visualise . Then we create very complex diagrams or maps of how we think the customer   experience is going to work ideally . Pictures and images enable us to not only help people   understand what it is we 're trying to do but to help persuade them in the worthiness of that   particular idea or the strength of that concept .

"Group Leading Challange 

 In my first year of work there was a Project that all new comers ( new grads ) were attented . 

 The Project was about finding weak features and suggesting new ideas on one of the apps that 

 individual teams have . 

 Each group had one team leader and I was one of them . Every team was approximately 20 - 30 

 people . Managing that many people and coming up with an good consequences was not an 

 easy thing for me . We had 1 full day to be together . However before that day we learnt our 

 app had a time thing and work on it . However , the majority of the work remains on meeting 

 day and team leaders picked up just a very short period of time . We also have in each team a 

 supervisor . 

 The tool that we used for come up with new and vital ideas was dividing our teams into 

 smaller pieces and making contest among each other . By doing that every team had list of 

 ideas and every team had to give points foe each idea and in on shot 1 team was graded . And 

 winner team will have free meal as reward . I choice this method because interaction among 

 people and graded by others is crucial thing for team issues . It has passion , excitement and 

 fun . 

 We had 4 teams and had a half day to thing as a group . We also have some rules if someone 

 violates it than this person ’s group will take minus one point ahead . The rules are like entering 

 each others room for interrupting and cheating . We have common areas for rest and some 

 snacks in that area and also one could get fresh area . However longer than 20 min breaks were 

 not allowed . I was also in one of teams and also checking at my breaks the other for not 

 permitting the violations . However it was not an easy thing and was hard to focus 

 everybody ’s focus for this event . 

 For applying this contest model for bringing up new ideas was an good choice I think . 

 Otherwise , managing the process by 20 people could not be an affective way . 

 The teams were arranged by their own wish . However at some points it made concentration 

 difficult . <ADDRESS> he next time I will arranged groups randomly to get and better concentration 

 and as a result better work .

"Mind mapping 

 Challenge & selection   I am in charge of the business administration of a small human resources agency dedicated 

 to the recruitment and selection process . Last year we had an increase in the number of 

 customers [ companies interested in us to look for the best candidates for their available 

 positions ] , but in the middle of this year we started to lose some of them . We did not know 

 why since we were just implementing our sales department and our operation team 

 [ psychologists in charge of the recruitment and evaluation ] were too overwhelmed with the 

 workload to ask the clients why they were leaving .      So , with that escenario , we decided that the first task that we would have with our emerging 

 sales team would be to get to know our clients in order to offer services according to their 

 needs . For this exercise we would be working with meetings , interviews and surveys to 

 collect information from our clients . Then , with the help of our sales and operations 

 departments , we would work on a mind mapping to look for patterns and insight of our 

 clients .      Application   After collecting information about our clients - information such as size of the organization , 

 kind of industry , internal organization , problemas that currently have in the recruitment and 

 selection processes , reasons to buy services like ours , reasons not to buy services like ours , 

 pain points and so much more - we took a day from our daily activities to work on the mind 

 mapping . We worked in a big saloon and put all the gathered information in a big board . 

 Then , we called all the people from the sales and operational departments [ we are a small 

 group , so we were 10 people in total ] to observe the information , pick the good stuff and then 

 cluster it . We also discussed the information in small groups in order to understand it .      Insight & approach   After this exercise we were able to determine the profiles of the clients that we had and what 

 they needed to buy services like ours . Also it helped us to design better services to offer to 

 them and to new clients . Finally , we got to recover some of the clients that we lost due to all 

 the changes that we made to our services .       We decided to do the exercise with the people of all the departments because , since we are 

 still a small agency , we wanted all to be aligned with and to understand the profile of our 

 clients and to know very detailed how the design of our services fulfill their needs . Therefore , 

 given the good results of this exercise , we will definitely be using this tool in the future with 

 our team .

"Where do learning launches fit strategically ? Companies should undertake a portfolio   of growth initiatives and manage that portfolio across business units based on   timelines designed to produce new sources of revenue , which can be scaled across a   large geographical area or customer base . The purpose of growth initiatives is to   create new S Curves of income to replace existing S Curves as their useful lives peak .   In order to do this , companies need to generate growth ideas and test them in a   disciplined manner to determine which ideas warrant investment . 

 Learning launches are a methodology for testing ideas to determine which qualify as   business opportunities . Because they should occur quickly and be low cost , learning   launches have also been described as “ placing small bets fast . ” Unfortunately , some   executives have interpreted that phrase as advocating the pursuit of small revenue   opportunities , which is not the case . Most good growth companies are looking for   growth opportunities to be scaled and result in needle - movers . “ Small bets fast ” is a   testing procedure , however , and not a strategy decision . A learning launch is a   business - world application of the scientific method ; it is a way of thinking that relies   on generating and testing hypotheses . It starts with hypothesis - generating by asking   a what - if question , which allows you to identify a new possibility to act on . That   possibility is your hypothesis — basically an educated guess about something   you think is likely to be a good idea . That ’s the creative part . Then to test your   hypothesis , you specify what scientists call the boundary conditions . In other words ,   you ask : Under what conditions would that hypothesis , in fact , be a good idea ? Or —   worded differently — what would need to be true in order for my idea to be a good   one ? So , you bring to the surface the assumptions that lie under your hypothesis , and   then you go find the appropriate data with which to test them . That is the analytic   part . If it turns out that your assumptions are not true , and your hypothesis   is disproved , then you should take the new data and go back and use it to restate the   hypothesis better . And then you test that new and improved hypothesis . It is an   iterative process that you cycle through continuously , learning something new each   time that allows you to develop a better hypothesis for the next pass . The process is   what we refer to as intelligently opportunistic . In other words , it lets you rigorously   examine your current best guess , but not in a way that forces you to accept or reject   it . It instead allows new and previously unanticipated improvements to your idea to   emerge . This is learning as you go . This hypothesis - driven approach is based on the   idea of learning , rather than knowing . As a result , it is particularly useful under   conditions of uncertainty in which we do n’t know as much as we ’d like to . Does all of   this sound familiar ? Of course it does — a new business idea is , in fact , just a   hypothesis . And a learning launch is just a process for testing and improving that   hypothesis . 

 That ’s the rub . Hypotheses about the future are a lot trickier to deal with than those   about the present ; in fact , they can never really be proven to be true . As a strategist or   a growth leader , the best you can do is to marshal compelling evidence that supports   your argument that your view or your “ story ” about the future is likely to be worth   pursuing . It has to be testable with today ’s data .

"Visualization 

 Challenge : 

 Hi , I am UX designer for a digital based service company ( I am in a non - manger role ) . Earlier my typical   work was to design the application for <ADDRESS> . The client with which our company has already signed   contract for certain ( vague ) solution . However now my job has a new parameter to pitch ideas to non- client profile ( selling the solution / capability/ go to market activity for possible client ) . The challenge I   face is to find the brief from our internal stakeholders . As a big company there are huge organizational   problem . Everyone wants the amazing aha solution within no time . Literally I gets 2days or maximum 3   days . The other thing which my company loves is doing conference calls every day . Hence , meeting over   phone is the only collaborative thing we do ( ca n’t blame also as we all sit in different location of earth ) . I   had a big problem to really open up the people from domain , business and add value to the discussion   for a good solution . Also on personal front the problem was to document every small research I do and   present them in short span . 

 Selection : 

 Visualization is a great tool . Since my childhood I had a habit of taking notes in combination of   pictograms and words , a habit that has evolved considerably with time . Earlier I was shy to show the   scribble as part of discussion to my mangers . Everyone was used to PowerPoint presentation . My   internal stake holders were used to asking me “ what you have done ? ” One day I got frustrated ( wanted   to ask them back what you have done ) and I showed them my scribble and said “ this is my   understanding & I am working over it ” . I found that everybody took interest and started giving other   important points . Slowly I practice this with other stakeholders and found it easy , engaging and quick to   discuss over and also to recall the whole discussion next time . It was easy to discuss over scenarios and   environment and pain points .   We have started practicing these methods in our client presentations as   well . 

 Application : 

 I start with taking notes and then google the main keywords ( under image search ) . I spend time with   images surfing . The image searching itself starts building environment for me . I think my eye and brain   does a good job in secretly collecting all the actions in images , icon , new keywords , and related item   back in my mind . Then I re - read the notes from my stakeholders to understand there problem   statement . And then I simply scribble everything which comes to my mind , it can be a pain point , a   notification solution , a new connection . Not to mention the star - man I learnt in one of courser- Human- Centered Design : an Introduction . The Prof <NAME> <NAME> taught few quick scribbling techniques . I try   to group them to form a meaning and then present to my stakeholders . I use many tools to make these   drawing . Mostly Pen and paper or whiteboard . Secondly taking pictures from google ( mood board ) . Or   making illustration on adobe Illustrator / Photoshop . 

 Soon with 1 - 2 discussion the scribbling turns into elaborately mapped story , a day in a life of users ,   which further got developed to <NAME> <NAME> , scenario map in my organization . If I can not connect   them , I simply leave them in chunks with bubble at background . 

 Insights : 

 Since drawing brings everyone on same page . They were able to add few key words which started giving   more flavor from different aspects like domain , business , and various solution types . This was helpful to   get connect with different personas of client ( CEO , marketing , branding , etc ) . In doing so , we were able   to collaborate more with our clients , our colleagues , stake holders and the different verticals within the   company itself . 

 Graphic / pictures helps to bring focus to the team everyone start visualizing the environment and helps   to build the bridge or missing link in the story . 

 <ADDRESS> love to see a single page document over 30 - 50 slides of power - point presentation . 

 Apart from others , I found myself bringing more insights in due course of time analyzing how mangers ,   sales , business , domain pitch to client . They all have different way of narrating story to same client . 

 Approach : 

 Since now I make a lots of scenarios , journey maps and concept screen . I see there are many layers in   same story while visualizing . Current state , future state . Sometime in store scenario and digital scenario .    I have started looking into other tools like PowerPoint and <NAME> for interactive visualization . In a big   story each internal stakeholder wants to concentrate on selected part of story for specific client . Making   a popover or zoomed in / out within a story with more details helps to get into this . I am looking forward   to bring all information to one page . Currently reading : Knowledge is beautiful by <NAME> <NAME> for   inspiration .

"VISUALIZATION 

 Visualization or visualisation ( see spelling differences ) is any technique for   creating images , diagrams , or animations to communicate a message . Visualization through   visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas   since the dawn of humanity . Examples from history include cave paintings , Egyptian   hieroglyphs , Greek geometry , and <NAME> da <NAME> 's revolutionary methods of technical   drawing for engineering and scientific purposes . 

 Visualization today has ever - expanding applications in science , education , engineering ( e.g. ,   product visualization ) , interactive multimedia , medicine , etc . Typical of a visualization   application is the field of computer graphics . The invention of computer graphics ( and 3D   computer graphics ) may be the most important development in visualization since the   invention of central perspective in the Renaissance period . The development of animation also   helped advance visualization . 

 APPLICATION 

 Scientific visualization   As a subject in computer science , scientific visualization is the use of interactive , sensory   representations , typically visual , of abstract data to reinforce cognition , hypothesis building ,   and reasoning . Scientific visualization is the transformation , selection , or representation of data   from simulations or experiments , with an implicit or explicit geometric structure , to allow the   exploration , analysis , and understanding of the data . Scientific visualization focuses and   emphasizes the representation of higher order data using primarily graphics and animation   techniques.[5][6 ] It is a very important part of visualization and maybe the first one , as the   visualization of experiments and phenomena is as old as science itself . Traditional areas of   scientific visualization are flow visualization , medical visualization , astrophysical visualization ,   and chemical visualization . There are several different techniques to visualize scientific data ,   with isosurface reconstruction and direct volume rendering being the more common . 

 Information visualization   Information visualization concentrates on the use of computer - supported tools to explore large   amount of abstract data . The term "" information visualization "" was originally coined by the User   Interface Research Group at Xerox PARC and included Jock Mackinlay.[citation needed ] Practical   application of information visualization in computer programs involves selecting , transforming ,   and representing abstract data in a form that facilitates human interaction for exploration and   understanding . Important aspects of information visualization are dynamics of visual   representation and the interactivity . Strong techniques enable the user to modify the   visualization in real - time , thus affording unparalleled perception of patterns and structural   relations in the abstract data in question . 

 Educational visualization 

 Educational visualization is using a simulation to create an image of something so it can be   taught about . This is very useful when teaching about a topic that is difficult to otherwise see ,   for example , atomic structure , because atoms are far too small to be studied easily without   expensive and difficult to use scientific equipment . 

 Knowledge visualization[edit ] 

 The use of visual representations to transfer knowledge between at least two persons aims to   improve the transfer of knowledge by using computer and non - computer - based visualization   methods complementarily.[8 ] Thus properly designed visualization is an important part of not   only data analysis but knowledge transfer process , too.[9 ] Knowledge transfer may be   significantly improved using hybrid designs as it enhances information density but may   decrease clarity as well . For example , visualization of a 3D scalar field may be implemented   using iso - surfaces for field distribution and textures for the gradient of the field.[10 ] Examples of   such visual formats are sketches , diagrams , images , objects , interactive visualizations ,   information visualization applications , and imaginary visualizations as in stories . While   information visualization concentrates on the use of computer - supported tools to derive new   insights , knowledge visualization focuses on transferring insights and creating   new knowledge in groups . Beyond the mere transfer of facts , knowledge visualization aims to   further transfer insights , experiences , attitudes , values , expectations , perspectives , opinions ,   and predictions by using various complementary visualizations .

 Product visualization[edit ] 

 Product visualization involves visualization software technology for the viewing and   manipulation of 3D models , technical drawing and other related documentation of   manufactured components and large assemblies of products . It is a key part of product lifecycle   management . Product visualization software typically provides high levels of photorealism so   that a product can be viewed before it is actually manufactured . This supports functions ranging   from design and styling to sales and marketing . Technical visualization is an important aspect of   product development . Originally technical drawings were made by hand , but with the rise of   advanced computer graphics the drawing board has been replaced by computer - aided   design ( CAD ) . CAD - drawings and models have several advantages over hand - made drawings   such as the possibility of 3 - D modeling , rapid prototyping , and simulation . 3D product   visualization promises more interactive experiences for online shoppers , but also challenges   retailers to overcome hurdles in the production of 3D content , as large - scale 3D content   production can be extremely costly and time - consuming.[11][12 ] 

 Visual communication[edit ] 

 Visual communication is the communication of ideas through the visual display of information .   Primarily associated with two dimensional images , it includes : alphanumerics , art , signs ,   and electronic resources . Recent research in the field has focused on web design and   graphically - oriented usability . 

 Visual analytics[edit ] 

 Visual analytics focuses on human interaction with visualization systems as part of a larger   process of data analysis . Visual analytics has been defined as "" the science of analytical   reasoning supported by the interactive visual interface"".[13 ] 

 Its focus is on human information discourse ( interaction ) within massive , dynamically changing   information spaces . Visual analytics research concentrates on support for perceptual and   cognitive operations that enable users to detect the expected and discover the unexpected in   complex information spaces . 

 Technologies resulting from visual analytics find their application in almost all fields , but are   being driven by critical needs ( and funding ) in biology and national security . 

 INSIGHT 

 visualization is critical to data analysis . It provides a front line of attack , revealing intricate   structure in data that can not be absorbed in any other way . We discover unimagined effects ,   and we challenge imagined ones . 

 Data by itself , consisting of bits and bytes stored in a file on a computer hard drive , is invisible .   In order to be able to see and make any sense of data , we need to visualize it . In this chapter   I ’m going to use a broader understanding of the term visualizing , that includes even pure   textual representations of data . For instance , just loading a dataset into a spreadsheet software   can be considered as data visualization . The invisible data suddenly turns into a visible ‘ picture ’   on our screen . Thus , the questions should not be whether journalists need to visualize data or   not , but which kind of visualization may be the most useful in which situation .   In other words : when does it makes sense to go beyond the table visualization ? The short   answer is : almost always . Tables alone are definitely not sufficient to give us an overview of a   dataset . And tables alone do n’t allow us to immediately identify patterns within the data . The   most common example here are geographical patterns which can only be observed after   visualizing data on a map . But there are also other kinds of patterns which we will see later in   this chapter . 

 Using visualization to Discover Insights 

 It is unrealistic to expect that data visualization tools and techniques will unleash a barrage of   ready - made stories from datasets . There are no rules , no ‘ protocol ’ that will guarantee us a   story . Instead , I think it makes more sense to look for ‘ insights ’ , which can be artfully woven   into stories in the hands of a good journalist . 

 Every new visualization is likely to give us some insights into our data . Some of those insights   might be already known ( but perhaps not yet proven ) while other insights might be completely   new or even surprising to us . Some new insights might mean the beginning of a story , while   others could just be the result of errors in the data , which are most likely to be found by   visualizing the data . 

 APPROACH- 

 Two Approaches to Data Visualization — Understanding and Persuasion . ... This type   of visualization is often a collection of basic charts and graphs . The goal is to present the data in   an in - depth and unbiased way . The second type is visualization for persuasion . 

"
"Mind mapping is used to represent how ideas or other items are linked to a central idea and to 

 each other . Mind maps are used to generate , visualize , structure , and classify ideas to look for 

 patterns and insights that provide key design criteria . A mind map is a tool for the brain that 

 captures the thinking that goes on inside your head . Mind mapping helps you think , collect 

 knowledge , remember and create ideas . Most likely it will make you a better thinker . Mind maps 

 can be created in many different ways , but they share the same basics . A mind map is a graphical 

 way to represent ideas and concepts . It is a visual thinking tool that helps structuring 

 information , helping you to better analyze , comprehend , synthesize , recall and generate new 

 ideas . Just as in every great idea , its power lies in its simplicity . In a mind map , as opposed to 

 traditional note taking or a linear text , information is structured in a way that resembles much 

 more closely how your brain actually works . Since it is an activity that is both analytical and 

 artistic , it engages your brain in a much , much richer way , helping in all its cognitive functions .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 It is very difficult   to find yourself as an imperfect human being in a role of giving hope to 

 other imperfect beings especially those who find themselves in circumstances far beyond their 

 comprehension . I work with with one of the key population who we refer to as prisoners . Where 

 I work , I deal with prisoners from all walks of live , some are fathers , juveniles , foreigners , 

 criminals , some are awaiting trials and some are psychitric patients . It takes more than passion 

 and hard work to listen to this diverse group and try to make them look at life in a different 

 light than their current situations . It is even more difficult when language is a barrier and then 

 you got to call the third person who is not even qualified or trained to interpret . What has 

 always intriqued me is the ability to help someone come up with a better solution without being 

 judgemental or prejudice . 

 Selection 

 I have leant to use mind mapping to get through to my clients who are prisoners(inmates ) and 

 their <ADDRESS> officers ) whom are at times judgemental to their clients and illtreat 

 them . I have not always known the in depth of mind mapping but the little knowledge I knew 

 was that it makes complex issues easy to breakdown and remember since it uses a lot of 

 drawing which stick to the mind . It further uses partens to search for depth hidden insights 

 which sways one into treating something complex into a simple manner . 

 Application 

 Coming from a background of giving group and individual counselling to students and teachers 

 whom were already used to the idea of counselling was easy however giving the same to prison 

 enviroment seem a bit complex and it was further met with resentment and aparthy . So for me 

 to permeate the idea of counselling I needed to understand what was their idea of counselling 

 in contrast to what I know and for that i used mind mapping . I took both the prison officers and 

 the inmates through what I believe to be counselling at separate times in contrast to what they 

 know counselling to be . I drew a square box with defination of counselling and branches that 

 support counselling and I drew a circle opposite the square and wrote counselling in prison . I 

 then asked the grounp to come up with what their understanding of prison counselling is in 

 contrast to counselling in general and to   link the similarities together . They also came up with 

 what worked and what did nt work at the end of the presentation . The pictorials made the 

 presentation fascinating and simple to engage everyone   and at the end we had a common 

 thinking . 

 Mind mapping in working with the above two groups was helpful since it gathered the current 

 trends and understanding of what counselling is to both groups and it further readressed issues 

 of now that we know what counselling is what is it that could be done to generate common 

 themes that will include all prisoners . It made everyone to think out of the box which is named 

 design criteria in <ADDRESS> thinking processs and it paved way for new interventions which were 

 owned not by myself but by the prison officers and prisoners . 

 Insights and <NAME> 

 To me the example of art gallery and yard sale reflects on breaking ice by congregating all the 

 stakeholders in couselling together to reflect on what they are experiencing in so far as 

 counselling is concerned . They were honest in defining their current realities of counselling 

 and they clustered them into thems of what is working and what is not working for them . Mind 

 mapping is indeed an innovative way into making people start thinking and opening up about 

 the trends that they are experiencing and it further give insights into easily mapping issues into 

 themes and what does nt fall within the given criteria , yet is valuable in creating what could 

 work as opposse to what was . The mind mapping is colouful , connect ideas and enable people 

 to be imaginative which is the core of Innovative design and thinking . This is a tool we can 

 adopt in learning and understanding . 

 It is with no doubt that mind mapping in design thinking is a tool to reckon with , however 

 having gone through all this module of Design thinking and Innovation , I am rest assured that 

 alone mind mapping is not enough therefore if coupled with story telling and visualization , I 

 will be able to reach the many hearts of the key population I work with in building a better me 

 and better us .

"Challenge 

 I am part of an organization that teaches underprivileged kids . In my country there is a stark difference   between private ( paid ) and government ( free ) schools . Private school children have access to the best   and greater facilities . The government schools sometimes lack basic necessities . What we do is provide   alternate education , which I not prescribed in the school syllabus . The problems that we observe are   children not focusing and they do n’t relate . 

 Tool selection 

 To overcome this problem , I decided to go with the Visualisation tool . This was chosen because it is   observed that visual aids make children interested . Storytelling was also considered but it gets limiting ,   considering different topics . Mind mapping can get a little complicated for children from ages 10 - 13 , and   learning launch was not appropriate for an educational project . 

 Application 

 Animations , videos and tutorials along with picture charts and diagrams are the visual aids I chose .   Certain activities to make the sessions engaging were organized too . Children showed more interest and   awareness . For instance , for the climate change module we showed them videos and news pieces about   the Australian bush fires , and the reports about sporadic weather changes , they could relate to it   because they witnessed it in their region . It was effective to a certain level , a certain level because not   everyone was concentrating . 

 Insight 

 In order to educate children we must think like them , put ourselves in their shoes and see what interests   us . In this case , personally , it was my love for graphical explanations rather than textbook studying . 

 Approach 

 The changes that I would implement next time would be taking more time to see which method works   best out of all , and how could I make it more interactive .

"Example reflection- mind mapping 

 Challenge & selection- mind mapping is a important tool in design   thinking . It is a brainstorming tool for get out the invitations ideas from   the mind . Mind mapping is a one of the powerful tool for design   thinker . It ’s   also important to select the most flexible approach for best   designs . I learn from this is that , your mind is working 24/7 . So always   think behind the box , more think more invocation in your ideas . So   keep thinking always . 

 Application- Mind mapping is useful for adding a new innovative   thinking in current design for making a some different from others .   Mind mapping is more creative tool for design thinking . I understand   through this session is that , mind mapping is engaging your mind to   make a creative design or making a good pattern for design . 

 Insight- insight the design their more creative solutions for your design .   Mind mapping is important for basic four questions for make creative   or innovative design . What is , what if , what wows , what work . In all   four question the thinking behind the out of box is necessary . 

 Approach- in design thinking we using mind mapping for capture the   thinking of customer , therefore we satisfy the customer need or   requirements and improve our business in design thinking . It ’s common   way to understand the current situation according to our requirement .   This all I understand in my simple language .

"Visualization 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I was a leader of project control team in an oil and gas plant project . One 

 of the main tasks was to perform the change management . The change   management is that something added or deleted from the original scope of the   work , and the relevant compensation shall be proposed by the contractor for the   approval by the client . In the process of this change management , my team had   to prepare the justification and supporting documents while coordinating with   other related EPC ( engineering , procurement and construction ) teams within the   project . By the nature of the EPC plant project , the teams involved in the change   management had various professional / engineering backgrounds and experiences .   For a successful change management , my team had to communicate and gather   all available information and data at such an extensive level in a limited time   and resources . Therefore , I realized that the conventional approach by simply   requesting the info and data from other teams would not make the output that   we needed . I needed something simple and common visualization to make the   other teams to understand and tie them together on what we wanted in this   change management . 

 Application 

 While my team sitting in a meeting room , I started by listing items what 

 might be required for a successful change management . I listed Strategy – How   we will do this ? What the other teams can provide ? Networking – How we will   make a channel with the client from working level to the top management ? How   we will make an inter - discipline communication with the client ? What will their   roles and responsibility ? Item Management – How we will efficiently log and   manage all the information and data from other teams and the client ? How we   will categorize to build - up a case for a successful change management ? From   these three items , we were making simple graphics . 

 Strategy shall have Approach / Documentation / Concentration / 

 Coordination . Approach can be categorized Argument / Negotiation /   Cooperation . Under normal circumstances Argument always shall be avoided 

 with the client . Negotiation is not recommended since normally there are winner   and loser . Cooperation is our stance with the client while proposing them win- win solution for the change management . Documentation is the back - bone of   the change management . We need to make the Documentation up to the level   the client fully satisfies . At the end of the day , a successful change management   is what the client satisfies and approves , not we satisfy by winning over the   client . Concentration is required since there are always limited time resources .   If some information and data is not up to level to make a case , we need to   discard those with hesitation . 

 Over a week of period , our team exercised the visualization of the 

 change management . We progressively went into the details of the Networking   and Item Management in a similar manner that we did for the Strategy .   Although this visualization process was for the other teams with various   engineering professions and experiences , throughout the visualization process ,   our team could acquire the better understanding of the change management and   build up the confidence how to proceed and deal with unexpected situations in   the process of the change management . Also , after we shared this with the other   teams , we could have shortened the time for preparing the Documentation , and   exceeded our anticipated targets in terms of cost with the client via the   structured Networking and efficient <NAME> <NAME> . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this visualization exercise is the 

 simplicity in the details .   To include all insights from the various teams and   work groups , we shall embrace the details , but those details shall be visualized ,   using graphics in this case , to be more accessible . I have learned several things   throughout this process – things that will help me in the future , as I make my   way through the future projects .

"Challenge & Selection 

 Each of us in some way encounters <NAME> during their life , trying to clothe something   abstract in words and convey them to others in such a way that listeners can not only perceive   us , but also fully understand , realize and process the information within themselves .   Storytelling is certainly a good tool for professional , scientific activity for the reasons I listed   above . I like this tool because it does not require much effort and circumstances , or the specific   technique or special items required for a Visualization tool , for example . 

 Now I am not working , as I am a student , so all my experience comes from my everyday living   or learning process . In psychology classes , our teachers often resort to the <NAME> tool in   order to clarify different complex terms and concepts , give examples from life , scientific   experiments and narrating the conclusions from them of real people - participants of   experiments - who lived this experience on themselves . I learned this technique from the   teachers and after that used this tool when one of my friend turned to me for help in   understanding the terminology of one of the psychological topics . 

 Application 

 Once my friend , who does not understand the concepts of "" I , IT and the SUPEREGO "" , which   <NAME> <NAME> once deduced , turned to me for help . For a long time I tried to understand how   I can help her in understanding these terms and remembered , that I had a dream that helped   me personally to understand these three concepts . I told her the following story of my dream .   Term "" I "" in my dream was a small mouse that travels across a large , frightening and unknown   world , I ran and scoured all over the city in hopes of finding refuge for myself , I was clearly   aware of my little body and the tail , my paws with which I touched the ground . Exactly this way   I imagined the Conscious for myself . "" IT "" met at the very beginning of my journey , it was a huge   black monster , that hid in the fog and periodically made terrible sounds , I did not understand   where IT was , but I always felt its presence . It was Unconscious in my understanding . In the   end , the "" SUPEREGO "" presented itself in my dream as policemen who now and then strove to   find me , a little harmless mouse , they climbed into all hidden corners and holes , into all yards ,   nooks and crannies , buildings , grabbed me , but every time I managed to escape . It was my fault   and moral attitudes in my understanding . I told this story to her and , fortunately , she fully   understood me and thanked me for this personal but clear and detailed story . 

 Insight 

 As I said above , my story helped her fully understand the topic and continue her studies , since   she was very stuck on this topic . I was pleased that my personal experience in understanding   the topic helped someone else figure it out besides me . I learned a lot from this experience .   Firstly , I realized that it is important to give personal examples , but not dryly narrate and try to   explain some difficult topic to someone by using difficult terms . A good story leads to good   understanding , so in every topic you need to find something close to yourself . Secondly , I   realized that every difficult topic for myself needs to be clothed in words and terms that are   closer in understanding , to invent metaphors and personify some phenomena , for which the   Storytelling tool is ideal . We also need to learn how to use this tool correctly , be easier in   handling , terminology , bring metaphors , personify phenomena and turn to life rather than to   the scientific heritage . 

 Approach 

 Of course , I will continue to use the <NAME> tool further and if someone comes to me for   help again , I will use <NAME> again . This course opened my eyes to a lot and helped me to   deal with both this tool and others , which I will certainly use in my everyday living and   professional life . What could I change in my approach to using this tool : perhaps I would resort   to using this approach in conjunction with other approaches ( for example , with the   Visualization tool ) and try to compose their harmonious sound for a more complete picture . I   could compose an interesting story on an exciting topic , and then clothe it in pictures , diagrams   and graphs . I have done this earlier during the educational process and it really helped , since   not all people perceive information well by ear .

"Reflection – Mind Mapping with Visualization Embedded   <NAME> <NAME>     Challenge     I am a coaching psychologist who was tasked to identify the right people to form a military task   force at headquarters , design the team structure , help them design the best physical space for   them to operate in from a people perspective , do everything possible to nip systemic issues in   the bud to minimize burnout . As well , in our conversations , we discussed how we could   continuously improve on our design for future teams , allowing them to be flexible enough to   address their unique situations , level of intensity and immediacy .     What I had to address was the following : The team would be small . Having them located in the   same building as the rest of the staff at <NAME> was very distracting . The key decision- makers on the team had to be ‘ present ’ , well - rested and well - supported . In past task force   teams , we realized the 15 % of the team did 85 % of the critical work ; the rest of the team being   support systems and fact and information finders to support that core group . If any of the team   burned out , it would leave a gap in the information flow and seriously affect the work and short   time lines to move people on the field . We had to look at where they were physically located ,   whether we have one team or multiple , smaller teams , keep in mind how resilient the team   members were ( test for that ) and how the information and decisions were disseminated .   Where the troops were located had a direct bearing on how quickly the decision had to be   made and implicated people ’s lives . We had a very short time frame to get this team up and   running and make sure it was the best team design possible . Even though we had limited time ,   did n’t mean we could n’t constantly tweak how we did things and test approaches as the team   did their jobs .     Selection     The tool I decided to use was <NAME> <NAME> ( Video Week 3 ) . I thought this would not only be   the best tool to capture all moving parts so to speak , but to create a common understanding of   the current reality , and address what was true in the moment as well as the multiple moving   parts that would change situationally . The Mind Mapping approach allowed for constant   tweaking and exploration . The basis of this tool that I used , also invited us to continuously live   in the questions . Embedded within this selection was a Visualization diagram ( Video Week 1 ) ; a   tool I created ( attached ) to form a picture in their minds , one of movement and fluidity . We   wanted this to be an ongoing process . I call this the Dance of Change ™ illustration . 

 Application     We identified a long hallway outside the team ’s offices to create the map and covered it with   white board sheets . At intervals down the long hallway were white board markers where   people could stop , reflect on what was in front of them and add their insights and input . We   wanted the area to be a free flow area that was n’t booked up with meetings and would be   available for addition and reflection . There was no right or wrong addition . Everyone ’s input   ( from the team , and their advisors ) was invited .      What was critically important for us was to get everything possible out on that white board   wall , so we could see how complex this was and to have the ability to address certain situations   quickly and responsively . A great part of this was realizing we had to constantly ask the same   questions to tweak and strengthen the entire ‘ system ’ . We started off with a map I created to   get the conversation and mapping started . We decided to meet a minimum of two to three   times a week for two weeks to discuss how the mapping process revealed priorities that had to   be addressed as well as ongoing team design that would benefit future task forces . By the end   of that period , the wall was covered with many moving parts to flush out the critical criteria of   what would make a strong , healthy and resilient team as well as their support systems . At that   point we convened to decide what priorities we would address to get moving and chose three   to test .     Insight     What occurred for me was that a linear approach would never work in this critical , fast - paced   environment . Using the Visualization illustration ensured that the What ’s True piece ( similar to   the What is ) revealed what everyone knew to be true at that time . It was the status quo . 

 Looking at What ’s Needed identified gaps and what we were n’t aware of or paying attention to .   The What ’s Available determined what resources i.e. time , people , resources etc . were   available so we could act sooner than later which , in turn , changed the What ’s True piece and   so on . Living in those questions and bouncing back and forth between them , allowed us all to   do more of the “ ’ What If ’ we approached things in ‘ this way ’ or ‘ first ? ” conversation ” . Keeping   us in the questions allowed for expansive conversation and be able to test various approaches   to find the best solution for this design criteria . It also eliminated the , “ We ca n’t do this ”   response and kept the conversation generative .     Approach     An alternate approach would be to condense the process into one day ; booking a large space to   map out all moving parts , cluster the ones that were similar and look at what emerged in the   process . Once we would do this , identify the themes , look at what we could test in a team   design within a certain period . This would address immediacy and the short timeline we had   available to us . As it was n’t a priority , we would address ongoing , future task forces separately .     With this option we would use <NAME> <NAME> exclusively to shorten the process , the   consultation and reduce options so we could test earlier .     Insight 2     Using Design Thinking is a brilliant way to give everyone a voice . It also elevated levels of   engagement and accountability . In my opinion , one of the best parts of this approach is shifting   a solution - based conversation to one of curiosity and learning . Testing ideas helped other   emerge and so on .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 The pre - launch ramp up of an industrial product ( non - software nor service ) is complex process .   The developed product , which has only seen relatively controlled conditions , faces then an   expensive and too often dramatic reality check . Involving various stakeholders and agendas :   Manufacturing something new in higher scale and lower control conditions in a facility trained   for ‘ always do the same ’ . Field application by specialized users , used ‘ the usual stuff ’ and   observing the newcomer as an unnecessary change . 

 Selection 

 In this context , many factors / properties , not intrinsic to product performance or specifications ,   are key to its correct manufacturing and application success . Both required ( yet not sufficient )   for a commercial success . 

 Instead of gesstimating these factors , it is preferred and more efficient to perform a learning   launch with a minimum viable product ( MVP ) . Which is usually more mature than a SW / Service   equivalent . But still open to take in the lessons and modifications raised by a learning launch   going through both manufacturing and application stages , gathering customer feedback . 

 Application 

 We used learning launch in a new product development to update a product range unchanged   for +10yr . Which involved manufacturing process modification , field application updates and a   lot of organizational expectation – anxiety . 

 Second development iteration ( out of four ) yielded an acceptable MVP . Which was taken to a   series of manufacturing rounds scaling up 104 the usual batch size and taken for field application .   Selection of ‘ close ’ locations allowed not only to adjust the technical parameters , but most   relevant gathering the feedback from operators , shift and site managers . Generally overlooked   stakeholders , but whose insight and buy – in is critical for product quality , performance , and   ‘ reputation ’ . 

 Insight 

 Assistance of product developers to the learning launch allowed to gather and translate   ‘ observational ’ into technical parameters . Many of these ( i.e. block stiffness and internal color )   were not affecting product performance and would have never been identified in standard   product profiling . Moreover , post launch learning would neither be possible since developers   would by then be mobilized to other projects , away from this one . 

 On the flip side , organization anxiety effects were underestimated . The learning launch didactics   and communication did not prevent bad mouthing for product underperformance . Disregarding   that this could be expected for the MVP and the learning launch goal was not the superior   performance of the specific MVP tested . 

 Approach 

 Next time will not overlook but rather take advantage that learning launch also offers learning   possibilities on how the organization will react at political level , what are the undeclared   expectations and positions of the different collectives .

"Visualization 

 Q : Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 Ans : Visualization of the data , that is in diversity , heterogeneity ( structured , semi- 

 structured , and unstructured ) and big in a volume or quantity , is a big problem . Speed is 

 also another factor in big data visualization but cloud computing and advanced 

 graphical user interface can manage the scalability of the big data . 

 There are some challenges in big data visualization which is represented as “ 4V ’s ” , 

 which is given below : 

 1 . Volume : High volume of datasets are enable to derive meaning 

 2 . Variety : Methods should be developed to combine different data sources as 

 needed . 

 3 . Velocity : Businesses should replace the batch processing with real - time stream 

 processing . 

 4 . Value : The Methods should be create business value by gaining insights from 

 big data 

 Q : Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it 

 is and why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video 

 lecture references ) . 

 Ans : Data visualization means to represent the data in some systematic forms or it is 

 about the explanation / description of the data by using images . It includes some kind of 

 attributes and variables that can be used for the unit of information . Visualization based 

 data discovery methods allow businessmen ’s to desperate data sources for an analytical 

 views . Some advance analytics can be integrated in the creation of interactive and 

 animated graphics on electronic devices such as computers , laptops . Mobiles , tablets , 

 etc

 Q : Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge 

 ( e.g. , what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 Ans : In big data applications , it is difficult to conduct data visualization because of the 

 high volume and dimension of the data . Mostly big data visualization has poor 

 performance in scalability , functionalities and response time . There are some solutions 

 to overcome the challenges and problems about data visualization are given below : 

 1 . One possible solution is the hardware on which you can save your big data to 

 put into the memory e.g. you can write your data on a notebook and then read 

 that material slowly and visualize it 

 2 . Having good expertise in order to understand the data e.g. if data is transfer in 

 your mother language then it is easy and quick to understand for you 

 3 . Data should be clean and understandable for visualization 

 4 . Data should be display in meaningful result for visualization effectively 

 5 . Another thing to visualize the data is to remove outliers from the data and create 

 separate charts for outliers 

 Q : Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to 

 your challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and 

 about design thinking more broadly ) . 

 Ans : Visualizations can be static or dynamic . Interactive visualizations often lead to 

 discovery and do a better job than static data tools . Interactive visualizations can help 

 gain great insight from big data . Interactive brushing and linking between visualization 

 approaches and networks or Web - based tools can facilitate the scientific process . Web- 

 based visualization helps get dynamic data timely and keep visualizations up to date . 

 Q : Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the 

 same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why 

 Ans : The tool which I will be used next time is the mind mapping because it represents 

 the ideas that are linked to a central idea and to each other . Mind mapping are used to 

 generate visualization , structure and categorize the ideas to look for patterns and 

 insights that provide designing criteria . We do this by presenting our idea and by survey 

 in order to ask from the people about the themes and patterns to emerge . Mind mapping 

 needs team spot for success .

 Challenge & Selection 

 I own a small business with my fianceé . We sell different kinds of desserts like   brownies , alfajores , chocolates for <NAME> and panettones for Christmas . The   profits were good , but the problem was that we were a seasonal company , so we   had low incomes along the year . The challenge was to convert a seasonal   business into a profitable one during the whole year . The tool I chose to overcome   this challenge was Visualization , because it was important to materialize the   ideas and understand how they work . The main purpose was to retain those   seasonal costumers that buy my products in Easter and Christmas . To achieve   the goal , we needed to understand who our consumers were and what they like .   Without Design Thinkig , we would probably just ask them what they want .   However , we understood that the answer could be the same any other competitor   would have . So , to make it work , we used the Visualization tool with a group of   costumers in order to overcome the main problem . 

 Application 

 I started the process by looking for what our main competitors sell and what   consumers think about their products . The collection of data gave me an overview   of the market . However , the main core of any business are the consumers , not   the data . The question was “ What if we call consumers to a focus group and   understand their point of view of our company and their desires about the   market ? ” . It seemed a good strategy to evolve costumers in the creative process   of our portfolio . To develop this idea , we chose a mixed group of twenty   costumers . The first half were compounded by our loyal consumers and the   second half were not our consumers yet . The main point here was to understand   the people who were not our costumer and listen what our costumer had to tell   us . 

 The activity was designed to leave the individuals as free as possible . They could   talk freely , and we asked some key questions to help us with the problem . They   had some time to draw or make collages of the answers . After that , they could   explain what each of picture means . Some of the questions used in the study are   presented below : 

  What <NAME> ( In English Alchemy ) means to you ? 

  What is a good food for you ?    What is a bad food for you ?    What is your favorite dessert ? 

 They were divided in four groups mixing the two types of consumers . We lead the   dynamics , but we did not interfere in the discussion in order to give the proper   space to conversations flow properly . Although they were in group , the opinions   were individual as the images generated . The main purpose of the format was to   foment the discussions . The images produced were collected and used in a board   divided . 

 C1 - Internal use 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from this exercise were that our consumers had a pretty   interesting point of view of our company . Most of the draws / collages about the   first question were related to creativity and quality . It was a good feedback from   our costumers . However , in the conversations , they also related <NAME> with   Easter or Christmas . This answer was interesting because they think we offer a   good quality product , but they do not buy it during the year . This image is related   to how I manage the posts and the propagandas of our products . The   advertisements at our main media ( Instagram ) are only boosted in these two   seasons . If the propaganda was more often and diverse they would see the posts   with frequency and ask for the products not only in April or December . The idea   of <NAME> in their minds were built buy us . 

 The second important learning from this exercise is related to the other three   questions . Looking for the images they produced I could see that their favorite   sweets were not the one offered by other competitors . Most of the images were   related to affective memories with their families . We understand that we can not   offer the same products , but the question is : How to transform our products in   affective memories ? How can we take advantage of the previews affective   memories and be successful in the market ? The answer of this question can put   us ahead of other competitors and make our incomes grow . The first idea that   came is to adapt some of the flavors we offer today to others closer to those   memories . The way to validate this idea will be using another Design Thinking   tool , the Learning Launch . The point is to have some prototypes of new products   and test with the same group . 

 From this exercise , I could understand the costumers of my business beyond the   answers they could give to me . People are valuable for small business , so they   should be in the center of innovation . Using the Visualization tool , I could create   a persona that I want to transform into my costumer . It will help me in future   developments of other products .

"Reflection - Visualisation 

 Challenge 

 I am a Transformation Program Manager working with Company A which specialises in patent   management . Patent management is a governance - led administrative process which ensures   patents stay validly registered so that inventors continue to reap the rewards of their work .   Company A acquired Company B last year . Company B is a start - up specialising in patent search .   Patent search uses sophisticated AI technology to search for patent infringements so that inventors   can protect their work . 

 Company A employed 500 people and had a culture based on deep knowledge of customer needs   and strong process expertise . Company B had 100 employees , many of whom were self - confessed   technology geeks . Integrating the two companies would open up a high - growth market but there   was concern that the two organisations would not understand or equally respect each other ’s   contribution .   The challenge was how to blend two very different cultures starting with creating a   new integrated leadership team . 

 Selection 

 I decided to use visualization as a design thinking tool to help create a metaphor for the combined   leadership team . This is part of the ‘ what is ’ process and I chose it because , as <NAME> <NAME> states in   the Visualization Tool lecture , visualization encourages a different type of problem solving to just   logic . It stimulates the right - hand side of the brain , encourages creativity and alignment . 

 Application 

 The new leadership team had 8 people from Company A and 2 from Company B.   I divided them into   two groups ensuring a mix of representatives on each team . and gave them boxes of cards with   images on them . They were asked to choose images of the merger that resonated with the group   and to then explain their choice to the rest of the group . One team came up with the metaphor of a   beach for the combined company and it generated the most excitement in subsequent discussions .   Company A were the lifeguards keeping everyone ( inventors ) on the beach safe and Company B   were the search and rescue divers using helicopters ( search algorithms ) to locate people further out   in the sea in need of help . What they most liked about it was that both lifeguards and divers were   clearly valuable and prized . They then came up with the idea of having a monthly company - wide   beach bar - b - q to bond , share information and highlight what had been done to keep people   ( inventors ) safe that month . 

 Insight 

 The use of visualisation techniques led to a willingness to experiment and the atmosphere became   more open and fun . Enabling the team to create their own metaphor led to increased buy - in and   empowerment for the future of the company . They bonded around a shared concept of protecting   and saving the interests of inventors and even innovation itself . 

 Approach 

 The plan had been to present the results of the visualisation to second level management using   power - point and a town hall discussion . However , having seen that the leadership team got the   most learning out of the shared experiential nature of selecting images and creating a metaphor , I   agreed with them that we would instead enable their direct reports to have their own shared 

 experiential learning . I did this by setting up a room with high level visualisations of the beach   metaphor and then letting the 2nd level senior management team add their own ideas to it . This   helped them to understand the part both companies played and to embed their own feeling of the   merged company . I would use the visualisation technique again because it works to encourage   collaboration , create energy and fun , cut through resistance and help people to think out of the box .

 Challenge : 

 I am a product manager , working in the marketing team of a leading cosmetic company , in charge of a   brand that was struggling . This brand has had several launches in the past 3 years that were supposed to   be THE ONE – the Needle mover - and ended up ruining the reputation of the brand . As a result the   commercial team along with our clients and customers have lost trust and faith in the brand . They all   became very skeptical to any new product , story and promises . I had to turn the brand around and was   given the opportunity to launch a product into the market which I was the only one to believe it was   going to be a success and be THE needle mover we have all been waiting for . I strongly believed in the   new product because I worked with the technology utilized in that product in another channel where it   had proven its potential . Knowing the end consumer I was working with and their needs based on   previous qualitative and quantitative research we have done I was sure that I had between my hands   the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . I needed to convince the commercial team and the clients to launch the product and   invest in it . 

 Selection : 

 I decided to use the learning launch tool . I had the idea ( new product ) , the target group with the specific   need and I was missing the testing ground . Therefore I needed to convince one client to allow me to test   my hypothesis . 

 Application : 

 To convince one client to allow me to test my hypothesis I have used story telling technic , talking about   the history of the technology , what it has achieved in other markets and how it can answer the need of   their consumers which we had identified together by doing observations and intercepts in their stores .   As a result , the product was launched in about a 100 doors and we tested the sellout , impact of the 

 C1 - Internal use 

 product on the brand image and the consumers ’ feedback about the concept , the performance of the   product and its relevance in their daily life . The data we collected confirmed our theory and convinced   the most skeptical of the group .   As a result we continued with a roll out with all clients and this product   today is a hero product which has saved the brand image and increased profitability and sales . 

 Insight : 

 We have been used to taking the same launch approach every time , which is to launch a product wide   and big . As a result losses are huge . With the learning launch process I was able to break a cycle of bad   decisions and build a launch with a stronger base . By involving the team ( believers and skepticals ) and a   client we were able to test and convince each other of the potential the product offered all of us . 

 Approach : 

 I believe I have used the right tool for the dilemma I had . However it is not always the right tool and go- to tool I would use . All will of course depend on which question I am trying to answer . In general my go   to tool in life is story telling .

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 Challenge      Storytelling is the process of using fact and narrative to communicate something to your    audience . Some stories are factual , and some are embellished or improvised in order to better    explain the core message . 

 <NAME> is an art form as old as time and has a place in every culture and society . Why ?    Because stories are a universal language that everyone — regardless of dialect , hometown , or    heritage — can understand . Stories stimulate imagination and passion and create a sense of    community among listeners and tellers alike . 

 Telling a story is like painting a picture with words . While everyone can tell a story , certain people    fine - tune their storytelling skills and become a storyteller on behalf of their organization , brand , or    business . You might ’ve heard of these folks — we typically refer to them as marketers , content    writers , or PR professionals . 

 I love to listen to stories . I get to learn a lot of things from them . Better storytelling can help in    better communicating with a person which would eventually help to understand someone in a    much more efficient way . 

 Selection 

 Every member of an organization can tell a story . But before we get into the how , let ’s talk about    why we tell stories — as a society , culture , and economy . There are a variety of reasons to tell    stories — to sell , entertain , educate or brag . 

 Stories help solidify abstract concepts and simplify complex messages . Taking a lofty ,    non - tangible concept and relating it using concrete ideas is one of the biggest strengths of    storytelling in business . 

 Take Apple , for example . Computers and smartphones are a pretty complicated topic to describe    to your typical consumer . Using real - life stories , they ’ve been able to describe exactly how their    products benefit users … instead of relying on technical jargon that very few customers would    understand . 

 Stories make us human , and the same goes for brands . When brands get transparent and    authentic , it brings them down - to - earth and helps consumers connect with them and the people    behind them . 

 Application 

 I use the storytelling tool much often . I love UI / UX design . So whenever there a problem comes up    it ’s very crucial to do the background research , take interviews of users , explain your insights to    stakeholders . So I use stories to make an impact , and help them understand things better . It also    helped me to create empathy and understand users ’ emotions and frustrations so that I can    design a better product for them . 

 I also link filmmaking . Particularly I am interested in cinematography and scriptwriting . So as we    know and the great movie starts with a great script . So when a movie project is started , I start    brainstorming and as soon I come up with some good idea , it ’s my job to explain my thoughts to    my team very clearly keeping in mind the budget constraints . 

 If you are interested too in music videos and filmmaking , please check out our youtube channel    Cinematic Section , IIT Roorkee​ or use the URL - <URL> 

 Insight & Approach 

 It is really a great tool . It helped me explain myself and my thoughts to others in a much more    effective way . I got to learn that good stories are- 

 ● Entertaining : Good stories keep the reader engaged and interested in what ’s coming next . 

 ● Educational : Good stories spark curiosity and add to the reader ’s knowledge bank . 

 ● Universal : Good stories are relatable to all readers and tap into emotions and experiences    that most people undergo . 

 ● Organized : Good stories follow a succinct organization that helps convey the core message    and helps readers absorb it . 

 ● Memorable : Whether through inspiration , scandal , or humour , good stories stick in the    reader ’s mind . 

 Also , I learned that , for a better storytelling approach , carry out the following processes- 

 1 . Know your audience 

 2 . Define your core message 

 3 . Decide what kind of story you ’re telling 

 4 . Establish your call - to - action 

 5 . Choose your story medium

"<NAME> <NAME> ( <NAME> <NAME> ) 

 Challenge : 

  I am a member of my Government Organization ’s – Unban Planning 

 Department and my / our challenge is to improve neighborhood parks .   The project scope neighborhood gardens serve a diverse segment of   society . As we take the test different age of the use of gardens   ( children , teenage and adults ) . The main challenge is how to develop   the gardens from the traditional view in line with the nature of our   atmosphere , where temperatures are high ( average 40 ° C ) . 

 Selection : 

  More than one team was formed and the tasks were distributed . Each 

 team was established using more than one performance . The mind   map was the effective performance , so that the concept of the main   idea was conceptualized and secondary ideas were added to the   main idea . 

  The benefit of using mind mapping tools is that we put our ideas 

 down in any order , as soon as one of the team says we put on board   to see the image in full ( diagram ) . 

 Application : 

  Workshops were held among the members of the team and it was the 

 work of secondary workshops with age groups of garden restorers   and put a plate of passers - by to brainstorm ideas . 

 Insight : 

  We have benefited from the use of the mind map that a diagram what 

 we used to represent ideas or information branching from a central   key idea help us with organization , problem solving and decision   making . 

 Approach : 

  The time we applied for the performance ( mind map ) we encountered 

 more than a challenge , so I told our experience in this area . It was   recommended to attend courses for development in this area . It was   also suggested to address the IT department of the company in order   to work a smart program that shortens our time and reduces the   waste of papers and make it a partnership with people outside the   work to increase the scope of generating ideas for any future project   serves the community .

"HOW SILENT ROAMERS TURNED INTO ACTIVE ONES ? 

 Challenge : 

 I have been working for a GSM company for a long time , one of the most challenging problems we   have seen was our customers communication habbits when they are abroad . They use our bundle   voice , data , sms packages without any fear in our home country , but we saw that when they go   abroad , some of them were not using their mobile packages , instead they were choosing to close   their telephones , they prefer to be silent . We focused on to solve our silent roamer problem , we   tried to solve “ How can we turn our silent roamers into active ones ? Also how can we decrease our   silent roamer percentage ? 

 Selection : 

 Mind Mapping tool was the most appropraite way to learn the reasons of our customers ’ behaviour ,   we thought that learning their insights was the most important thing that could gave a chance to us   to prepare appropraite roaming packages & campaigns for them .   Because mind mapping is looking   for patterns and insights in a large quantity of data you collected during your exploration of what is   the current reality . The goal is to establish criteria for the what - if idea generation phase . Which   comes next . Mind mapping provides a segway from what is to what if . 

 Application : 

 Initially we decided to organize a research phase to apply this method . First of all we segmented our   roaming customers according to their usage habbits as “ Silent Roamer ” , “ Occasional Roamer ” ,   “ Frequent Roamer ” . 

 Silent Roamer : Customers who do n’t use any voice , data & SMS tariffs whent they are abroad . 

 Occasional Roamer : Customers who use roaming packages temporarily , for ex 1 time out of their 2   trips . 

 Frequent Roamer : They use our all roaming packages . 

 First of all , our research team focused on the two segment , silent and occasional roamers . They   called silent roamers , tried to understand the reasons of being silent or closing mobile phones when   they are abroad . And also they called occasional roamers to try to understand their behavior . 

 Insight : 

 When we analyzed the research results , we saw that most of our silent customers wants to know   what to pay , they do n’t want to face with a roaming bill shock , they fear if they excess their packages   and if they have to pay big amounts . And also occasional roamers wanted to have tariffs easy to   understand , they do n’t want to deal with complex packages they want to do easy transactions . 

 Approach : 

 With analyzing these insights we reached by asking directly to our customers , we designed two   alternative packages for these two segments , first we made a test with a small of group and we   surprised by the change of our customers roaming communication habbits . We prepared small   packages with a limited usage , these packages stops when our customers consume the data or voice   limits in the package . So they bought and used our limited packages without any package excess fear .   After that packages our silent roamers decreased by % 25 . Also we launched “ Roam Like Home ”   Packages for our occasional roamers , these packages are activated by the first roaming usage , there 

 is no need to make an activation , with these packages our occasional roamers turned into active   users .

"Tool    of    Choice :    Visualization 

 Challenge 

 1 . The   challenge   I   faced   is   about   organisational   design :   how   to   identify   and   understand   our 

 target   customers ,   define   a   product   model ,   then   marrying   the   two   holistically   in   order   to 

 enable   the   company   to   deliver   against   the   real   needs   of   the   customers   in   the   most 

 efficient   way   possible ,   also   achieving   consensus   between   every   stakeholder   in   the 

 company ? 

 2 . In   addition ,   people   involved   in   this   exercise   ( a   total   of   10 ,   plus   myself ,   including   C - Suite 

 members )   came   from   a   variety   of   backgrounds :   one   hand ,   this   ensured   a   wide   range   of 

 different   and   valuable   inputs   but ,   at   the   same   time ,   implied   that   each   of   them   used   a 

 slightly   different   language   and   had   in   mind   different   concepts .   This ,   in   turn ,   implied   that 

 stakeholders   were n’t   able   to   agree   on   what   the   “ ask ”   of   the   task   was   really   about   or   what 

 the   problem   we   were   trying   to   solve   exactly   was .   In   this   context ,   I   was   tasked   to   allow 

 these    stakeholders    -    me    included    -    to    reach    a    positive    conclusion . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 3 . The   environment   was   clearly   multidimensional :   the   variety   of   mindsets   involved ;   the   fact 

 that   stakeholders   were n’t   clearly   able   to   articulate   what   the   problem   really   was ;   the   huge 

 amount   of   data   available   ( in   the   form   of   technology   components ,   financial   analysis , 

 personas   and   quantitative   analysis   on   customer   behaviours ) .   All   these   aspects   made   me 

 believe   that   this   challenge   fit   the   definition   of   “ wicked   problem ”   ( according   to   the   definition 

 given   in   week   1 ,   “ Challenges   best - suited   for   Design   Thinking “ CBSDT ” , 1’31 ” ) , 

 corroborated   also   by   the   fact   that   it   was   really   hard   to   filter   the   data   available   to   draw   a 

 clear    cause / effect    relationship    (    compatible    with     CBSDT ,    1’58 ” ) . 

 4 . Hence ,   I   opted   to   deploy   one   of   the   tools   of   Design   Thinking :   Visualization .   The   rationale 

 behind   this   choice   was   related   to   the   diverse   mindsets   that   needed   to   a )   have   the   same 

 view   on   the   problem   in   order   to   b )   reach   consensus .   Visualization ,   I   thought ,   could   help   to 

 clarify   the   concepts   and   align   thinking .   Additionally ,   another   key   driver   was   the   need   for   a 

 deep   understanding   of   both   the   people   involved   ( to   reach   consensus   between   the 

 stakeholders )   and   the   customers   ( to   best   satisfy   their   needs   through   the   most 

 appropriate   product   model ) .   In   particular ,   this   driver   seems   to   be   well   aligned   with   what 

 has   been   discussed   in   the   course   ( “ design   thinking   is   appropriate   if   a   deep   understanding 

 of    the    actual    people    or    users    involved    is    essentia l ”     CBSDT ,    1’58 ” ) . 

 Application 

 5 . An   “ alignment   session ”   was   scheduled   in   order   to   iron   out   all   the   concerns   emerged 

 between   the   various   stakeholders .   Before   the   session ,   I   shared   the   list   of   Products   we 

 had   and   I   asked   everyone   to   write   on   post - its   who   their   “ key   customers ”   were .   In   the 

 session   we   began   by   sticking   the   “ key   customers ”   post - its   on   a   whiteboard   and ,   once   the 

 exercise   was   completed ,   we   found   4   main   clusters   representing   “ key   customers ” .   Their 

 needs   ( “ customer   needs ” )   were   also   agreed   during   the   dsicussion .   To   my   surprise , 

 alignment   was   quick   once   the   patterns   emerged   on   the   whiteboard .   These   “ key 

 customers ”   and   their   “ customer   needs ” ,   now   placed   at   the   top   of   the   whiteboard ,   became 

 the    basis    for    the    Product    Model    Strawman . 

 6 . The   next   step   was   to   draw   rectangular   boxes   scattered   across   the   board ,   each   box 

 representing   a   product   we   have   ( the   “ Product   Model   Strawman ” ) .   Then ,   I   asked   the 

 stakeholders   to   volunteer   to   draw   arrows   in   order   to   connect   Customers   to   Products ,   and 

 then   Products   to   other   Products   that   were   related   to   them .   I   also   asked   stakeholders   ( me 

 included ! )   to   write   down   the   outcome   for   each   of   the   Product   on   post - its :   I   then   stuck 

 <NAME> <NAME>           Design   Thinking   Assignment 

 them   near   the   most   appropriate   Product   and   we   began   to   test   each   Outcome   against   the 

 “ customer   needs ” :   I   allowed   45   minutes   of   discussion   in   order   to   iron   out   any 

 misunderstanding ,   re - crafting   the   outcomes   to   reach   consensus .   The   visualization   of   the 

 relationships   between   Customers   and   the   various   Products   -   the   Product   Model   -   as   well 

 as   the   outcomes ,   all   clearly   shown   on   the   whiteboard ,   generated   a   fruitful   discussion   that 

 allowed   the   group   to   reach   consensus   really   quickly ,   turning   the   meeting   in   a   great 

 success . 

 Insight 

 7 . The   insight   I   gained   from   this   experience   was   on   two   levels :   specific   to   the   session   and 

 more   generic ,   applicable   to   any   context .   With   regards   to   the   session ,   the   Visualization   of 

 abstract   concepts   on   a   whiteboard   as   well   as   the   opportunity   for   everyone   to   give   their 

 input   through   post - its   enabled   a )   the   creation   of   a   common   semantics   that   everyone 

 agreed   upon   thus   b )   enabling   a   meaningful   discussion .   Furthermore ,   active   participation 

 enabled   everyone   to   buy - in   very   quickly   as   the   work   was   also   considered   “ theirs ”   and   not 

 just   “ belonging ”   to   the   presenter .   I   believe   this   element   of   “ shared   learning ”   applies   also 

 on   a   general   level .   Furthermore ,   on   a   more   abstract   level ,   this   experience   taught   me   that 

 Visualization   can   be   applied   independently   on   the   background   of   the   people   involved ,   the 

 problem   to   be   addressed   and   that ,   in   fact ,   it   can   be   a   powerful   tool   to   reach   consensus 

 as    it   allows/”forces ”    people    to    focus    on    “ what    is    drawn    on    the    whiteboard ” . 

 Approach 

 8 . In   this   experience ,   I   recognised   that   the   most   important   element   is   the   possibility   for 

 everyone   in   the   room   to   visualise   concepts   via   simple   and   unequivocal   representations . 

 As   such ,   another   option   to   get   to   the   same   conclusion   that   I   considered   was   to   start   from 

 “ outcomes ”   rather   than   “ products ”   so   that   we   had   a   set   of    “ rectangular   boxes ” 

 representing   an   “ outcome   model ” .   This   approach   could   have   allowed   to   a )   better 

 understand   <NAME>   needs   and   b )   validate   our   current   list   of   Products ,   although 

 probably    it   could    have    required    more    time    to    complete . 

 9 . Nevertheless , I   decided   to   apply   Visualisation   again   but   using   this   “ outcome   first ” 

 approach   in   the   next   step   of   this   work   where   we   wanted   to   drill   down   into   Customers , 

 defining   a   set   of   lower   level“Sub - Customers ” .   I   scheduled   another   “ alignment   session ” 

 and ,   instead   of   starting   from   a   predetermined   list   of   “ sub - Customers ”   I   decided   to   ask   the 

 stakeholders   to   list   what   was ,   in   their   view ,   the   job   to   be   done ,   writing   them   down   into 

 statements   ( “ job - to - be - done   statements ” )   on   the   whiteboard .   Then ,   I   guided   the 

 discussion   to   cluster   the   ” job - to - be - done   statements ”   under   each   of   the   pre - existing 

 Customers ,   mapping   their   interrelations .   Each   set   of   interconnected   “ job - to - be - done 

 statements ”   became   a   new   “ Sub - Customer ” .   This   approach   enabled   us   to   quickly   identify 

 a   set   of   12   key   Sub - Customers   in   a   third   of   the   time   we   took   to   complete   the   Product 

 Model    work .

 What is <NAME> <NAME> ? ( and How to Get   Started Immediately ) 

 Brainpower   A mind map is a graphical way to represent ideas and concepts . It is a visual thinking tool that   helps structuring information , helping you to better analyze , comprehend , synthesize , recall and   generate new ideas .   Just as in every great idea , its power lies in its simplicity .   In a mind map , as opposed to traditional note taking or a linear text , information is structured in a   way that resembles much more closely how your brain actually works . Since it is an activity that   is both analytical and artistic , it engages your brain in a much , much richer way , helping in all its   cognitive functions . And , best of all , it is fun !   So , how does a mind map look like ? Better than explaining is showing you an example . 

 This is a mind map about – conveniently enough – mind mapping itself . It presents , in a visual   way , the core elements and techniques on how to draw mind maps . Yes , I know this may look a   little too messy initially , but bear with me : once you break the ingrained habit of linear note taking ,   you wo n’t look back .     Benefits and Uses 

 I think I already gave away the benefits of mind mapping and why mind maps work . Basically ,   mind mapping avoids dull , linear thinking , jogging your creativity and making note taking fun   again . 

 But what can we use mind maps for ? 

 •   Note taking 

 •   Brainstorming ( individually or in groups ) 

 •   Problem solving 

 •   Studying and memorization 

 •   Planning 

 •   Researching and consolidating information from multiple sources 

 •   Presenting information 

 •   Gaining insight on complex subjects 

 •   Jogging your creativity 

 It is hard to make justice to the number of uses mind maps can have – the truth is that they can   help clarify your thinking in pretty much anything , in many different contexts : personal , family ,   educational or business . Planning you day or planning your life , summarizing a book , launching a   project , planning and creating presentations , writing blog posts -well , you get the idea – anything ,   really . 

 How to Draw a Mind Map 

 Drawing a mind map is as simple as 1 - 2 - 3 : 

 •   Start in the middle of a blank page , writing or drawing the idea you intend to develop . I   would suggest that you use the page in landscape orientation . 

 •   Develop the related subtopics around this central topic , connecting each of them to the   center with a line . 

 •   Repeat the same process for the subtopics , generating lower - level subtopics as you see fit ,   connecting each of those to the corresponding subtopic . 

 Some more recommendations : 

 •   Use colors , drawings and symbols copiously . Be as visual as you can , and your brain will   thank you . I ’ve met many people who do n’t even try , with the excuse they ’re "" not artists "" .   Do n’t let that keep you from trying it out ! . 

 •   Keep the topics labels as short as possible , keeping them to a single word – or , better yet ,   to only a picture . Especially in your first mind maps , the temptation to write a complete   phrase is enormous , but always look for opportunities to shorten it to a single word or figure   – your mind map will be much more effective that way . 

 •   Vary text size , color and alignment . Vary the thickness and length of the lines . Provide   as many visual cues as you can to emphasize important points . Every little bit helps   engaging your brain .

 Challenge 	   & 	   Selection 	    In 	   my 	   daily 	   routine 	   as 	   a 	   member 	   of 	   the 	   logistics 	   team 	   at 	   a 	   local 	   distribution 	   company , 	   we 	   regularly 	    face 	   the 	   challenge 	   to 	   improve 	   the 	   logistics 	   systems 	   at 	   the 	   organization , 	   reduce 	   lead 	   times 	   and 	   bring 	    in 	   efficiencies 	   in 	   the 	   business . 	   This 	   not 	   only 	   requires 	   reduction 	   in 	   costs 	   at 	   various 	   levels 	   and 	   stages , 	    but 	   also 	   calls 	   for 	   productivity 	   enhancement 	   requirement 	   of 	   all 	   the 	   resources . 	   Hence , 	   for 	   me 	    Visualization 	   proves 	   to 	   be 	   an 	   excellent 	   tool 	   that 	   we 	   use 	   all 	   the 	   time 	   in 	   order 	   to 	   communicate , 	   think 	    and 	   discuss 	   design 	   improvements 	   of 	   the 	   overall 	   maps 	   to 	   constantly 	   incorporate 	   efficiencies 	   in 	   the 	    business . 	   It 	   is 	   important 	   because 	   of 	   the 	   fact 	   that 	   the 	   company 	   regularly 	   faces 	   issues 	   that 	   involves 	    bottlenecks 	   at 	   one 	   or 	   the 	   other 	   stage 	   of 	   the 	   process , 	   delayed 	   shipments , 	   lower 	   satisfaction , 	   lower 	    efficiencies . 	   Hence , 	   Visualization 	   proves 	   to 	   be 	   an 	   important 	   aid 	   in 	   this 	   regard . 	   Although 	   I 've 	   used 	    architecture 	   and 	   drawing 	   packages , 	   I 	   spoken 	   in 	   front 	   of 	   many 	   people , 	   but 	   my 	   "" breakthrough 	    moments "" 	   always 	   come 	   when 	   I 	   have 	   a 	   pencil 	   and 	   a 	   notebook 	   or 	   a 	   marker 	   pen 	   and 	   a 	   whiteboard . 	    Visualisation 	   really 	   is 	   the 	   key 	   to 	   getting 	   those 	   breakthrough 	   moments . 

 Application 	    The 	   foundation 	   of 	   business 	   intelligence 	   is 	   the 	   Key 	   Performance 	   Indicators 	   ( KPIs ) . 	   We 	   are 	   ( or 	   should 	    be ) 	   the 	   best 	   predictor 	   of 	   whether 	   the 	   business 	   is 	   good 	   or 	   not . 	   If 	   your 	   KPIs 	   are 	   on 	   track , 	   your 	   business 	    is 	   too . 	   This 	   is n’t 	   to 	   say 	   you 	   should 	   only 	   track 	   one 	   or 	   two 	   performance 	   indicators , 	   but 	   simply 	   that 	   your 	    KPIs 	   should 	   reflect 	   the 	   overarching 	   goals 	   of 	   your 	   logistics 	   business . 	   We 	   use 	   growing 	   realistic 	    directions 	   on 	   the 	   screen 	   to 	   do 	   understand 	   and 	   visualize 	   areas 	   like 	   Proximity 	   with 	   metrics 	   connected 	    to 	   each 	   other 	   by 	   pairs . 	   This 	   helps 	   us 	   to 	   identify 	   trends 	   and 	   patterns 	   that 	   share 	   a 	   causal 	   link 	   more 	    quickly . 	   For 	   example , 	   the 	   number 	   of 	   deliveries 	   within 	   a 	   given 	   month 	   and 	   the 	   average 	   amount 	   of 	    minutes 	   it 	   takes 	   to 	   unload 	   shipments 	   may 	   be 	   connected 	   to 	   each 	   other 	   in 	   ways 	   we 	   did n't 	   consider 	    earlier . 	   Drawing 	   useful 	   Visualizations 	   like 	   charts 	   help 	   us 	   in 	   discussing 	   complex 	   map 	   designs 	   and 	   route 	    planning , 	   which 	   takes 	   place 	   both 	   physically 	   and 	   through 	   advanced 	   software 	   as 	   well . 

 Insight 	   and 	   Approach 	    Visualisation 	   has 	   a 	   role 	   to 	   play 	   throughout 	   the 	   Design 	   Thinking 	   process 	   that 	   our 	   team 	   undertakes . 	    It 's 	   an 	   incredible 	   tool , 	   in 	   that 	   sense , 	   in 	   that 	   we 're 	   using 	   those 	   tools 	   and 	   that 	   part 	   of 	   our 	   brain 	   at 	   each 	    phase 	   in 	   the 	   design 	   process . 	   It 's 	   not 	   just 	   something 	   that 	   has 	   an 	   application 	   in 	   one 	   part 	   of 	   designing 	    the 	   entire 	   route 	   plans 	   and 	   revisiting 	   them 	   for 	   bringing 	   in 	   efficiencies . 	   It 	   has 	   many 	   ways 	   of 	   being 	    useful 	   at 	   different 	   parts 	   of 	   the 	   Design 	   Thinking 	   process . 	   The 	   Visualizations 	   have 	   considerably 	   helped 	    us 	   in 	   improving 	   understanding 	   of 	   problems 	   pertaining 	   to 	   the 	   route 	   planning 	   and 	   logistics 	   related 	    issues , 	   while 	   also 	   reducing 	   the 	   communication 	   gaps 	   at 	   our 	   end . 	   People 	   are 	   now 	   more 	   engaged 	   with 	    the 	   Visuals 	   that 	   are 	   available 	   to 	   discuss 	   and 	   we 	   can 	   all 	   now 	   focus 	   more 	   on 	   the 	   issue 	   in 	   hand 	   and 	    reduce 	   the 	   level 	   of 	   abstraction 	   that 	   previously 	   existed 	   during 	   the 	   meetings 	   and 	   team 	   discussions 	   of 	    similar 	   sorts . 	   Moreover , 	   for 	   personal 	   planning 	   and 	   preparatory 	   purpose 	   such 	   Visualizations 	   are 	   of 	    critical 	   help 	   which 	   give 	   clarity 	   of 	   thought 	   and 	   greater 	   understanding 	   as 	   well . 

 With 	   regards 	   to 	   approach , 	   the 	   approach 	   that 	   is 	   currently 	   being 	   used 	   has 	   been 	   validated 	   again 	   and 	    again 	   in 	   the 	   team 	   and 	   has 	   proven 	   track 	   record , 	   with 	   considerable 	   improvement 	   in 	   the 	   overall 	   team 	    results 	   and 	   efficiencies 	   for 	   the 	   business . 	   For 	   our 	   team , 	   Visualisation 	   is 	   equal 	   parts 	   listening , 	   thinking 	    and 	   drawing . 	   Listening 	   is 	   the 	   input , 	   thinking 	   is 	   the 	   processing 	   and 	   drawing 	   is 	   the 	   output . 	   These 	   three 	    skills 	   work 	   together 	   equally 	   in 	   understanding 	   complexity , 	   visualizing 	   outcomes 	   to 	   create 	   new 	    possibilities . 	   At 	   present , 	   at 	   our 	   organization , 	   keeping 	   in 	   view 	   the 	   importance 	   of 	   this 	   approach , 	    Visualisation 	   is 	   a 	   core 	   component 	   of 	   the 	   way 	   that 	   we 	   communicate , 	   either 	   for 	   personal 	   planning , 	   or 

 for 	   the 	   team 	   discussion 	   and 	   meetings . 	   It 	   helps 	   our 	   teams 	   unlock 	   different 	   parts 	   of 	   our 	   brains , 	   while 	    giving 	   consistency 	   to 	   our 	   ideas 	   as 	   well . 	   We 	   usually 	   refer 	   to 	   such 	   Visualizations 	   as 	   the 	   “ mother 	   of 	   all 	    the 	   design 	   tools ” 	   keeping 	   in 	   view 	   the 	   fact 	   that 	   they 	   are 	   used 	   in 	   almost 	   every 	   stage 	   of 	   decision 	    making 	   and 	   design 	   thinking 	   at 	   our 	   organization . 	   However , 	   one 	   thing 	   that 	   needs 	   to 	   be 	   changed 	   in 	   this 	    regard 	   is 	   the 	   fact 	   is 	   that 	   these 	   Visualization 	   can 	   be 	   shifted 	   from 	   physical 	   pen 	   and 	   paper 	   or 	   marker 	   or 	    drawing 	   board 	   to 	   more 	   modern 	   alternatives . 	   In 	   this 	   regard , 	   there 	   is 	   a 	   need 	   to 	   shift 	   to 	   modern 	   high 	    technology 	   touch 	   screen 	   design 	   boards , 	   which 	   would 	   provide 	   all 	   the 	   flexibility 	   present 	   in 	   the 	   physical 	    mode , 	   while 	   also 	   providing 	   the 	   right 	   amount 	   of 	   ability 	   to 	   work 	   on 	   different 	   ideas 	   at 	   once , 	   with 	   the 	    provision 	   saving , 	   copy 	   pasting 	   and 	   using 	   advanced 	   computer 	   tools 	   as 	   well .

"1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information 

 •   In my last professional experience ( in a consumer data science consultancy ) , we   had a challenge of diminishing our dependency regarding our retailer partner ’s   data ( from consumer behavior within their stores ) . This data , coming from our   retailer partner , used to be the main source of information , our raw material to   produce insights and science from consumer behaviors in general . 

 •   With that in mind , and few steps later , we developed an independent app ,   which ideally would get consumer behavioral information in return of discount   coupons . That ’s when I entered in the process : help to understand why   customers were afraid of share their personal shopping data with a private   company ( the company had already reached that point of awareness about the   problem ) . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and 

 why you selected it for your challenge ) 

 •   The tool that we selected was <NAME> <NAME> , due to some factors : it was a   disruptive app in the market ( we had no benchmark ) , and besides that ,   consumers were not used to this sort of product / app , so they could have some   difficulties to answer traditional surveys without having a practical experience   with a prototype 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , 

 what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 •   Our hypothesis was that consumers would not share their personal shopping   behavior data because they were afraid of being exposed ( loss of privacy ) 

 •   So that , we created some “ app user sessions ” , for small groups of clients with   different sorts of rewards for them , and then we asked their opinion about the   overall experience and how would they feel if there was a product like that in   the market . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your 

 challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about   design thinking more broadly ) . 

 •   The insight that we gained from applying the tool after few pilot rounds is that   clients would n’t mind of sharing their personal shopping behavior data ( what   they bought , where , when , how often , etc . ) for a private company as long as the   rewards were worth it . ( discounts in products that they valued , for example ) .   That is , if we used the app as a “ offer spam ” , to push products or promotions to   our clients , instead of offering sort of rewards that they value , our chance of   being unsuccessful was high . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool 

 you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 •   I believe that the application of the tool for this problem was useful . What I   would like to do differently was participating in since the beginning of the   process ( what was the problem ) , instead of participating from “ what wows ”   step onwards , which was what happened . Nonetheless , I can see how much   value this approach brought to us .

"Visualization 

 Challenge     When defining a software solution , certain challenges are encountered . The   one I consider that is present in all projects is establishing a common language   between all the stakeholders , however , in software engineering there are   specific diagrams already defined which are very useful when it comes to this   communication challenge .     The two I consider the most useful are : the business process diagram ( BPM ) ,   which might fit more the visualization approach , and the use cases diagram ,   that is closer to the mind mapping one . For this assignment I will focus on the   BPM diagram .     Selection     As described by <NAME> <NAME> in week 1 , the visualization tool allows us to think   in a nonverbal way , this is exactly why we chose it , it allowed us to go from a   basic abstraction of the problem to a complex flow and accelerated the   communication .     Application     At first , the engineering team listens to the customer needs and pains , trying to   refine the most accurate and simple model of the business processes and   taking notes for what is called “ business rules ” .     In order to ease the communication , all stakeholders made some drawings and ,   as diagrams are a very common tool for different disciplines , it comes natural   to generate a draft of the BPM diagram , maybe not by employing the precise   standard but in such a way both the solution provider and the customer make   clear every point .     Then , the engineering team presented a draft of the BPM diagram , the software   analyst explained briefly the standard and the diagram in detail to confirm there   were not any misunderstandings between the stakeholders .     Other diagrams were presented during the meetings , though , throughout the   whole project we kept on refining the BPM diagram as it became central and   communication was faster and faster due to the familiarity with such a useful   standard set of symbols . 

 Insight     I had not had the chance to ponder the power of diagrams and visualization   tools because I assumed their use since I was at the school , mainly because I   have not taken the complete responsibility for a project . Notwithstanding , I can   foresee I will encounter communication difficulties that I will know how to tackle   in advance as from now on I will spend some time paying more attention to the   specific advantages of each diagram .     Approach     Making a deeper reflection on the application of the visualization approach , I   consider that the manager hit the mark when planning the digital presentation   for the meetings , as information was presented clear and precise to the   customer . I guess the biggest challenge is not to forget applying these tools , so   I can prevent eternal discussions I have been involved myself .

"Reflection : Learning Launch 

 Challenge : 

 How do we drive the adoption and use of self - service on digital channels like Apps and Bots to reduce   calls to our contact centre and still ensure that customer satisfaction measured by a high NPS ( Net   Promoter Score ) is attained ? 

 My team and I faced that question as we looked to increase the penetration and usage of digital   channels to self - serve to reduce the number of inbound calls to the call centre . 

 As a team , we have been introducing new channels over the past few years and despite the growth in   these channels , we needed to increase the usage and ability of the customers to resolve their issues by   themselves without having to call or contact a live agent by introducing a chat bot . 

 The use of chat bots within our market was not that common and very few corporates had adopted this   as a means to serve customers . We therefore needed to do something different to get customers   engaged and to use the chat bot to resolve the issues especially for simple and repetitive queries . 

 The current penetration stood at 40 % , we needed to get this to 60 % within a period of one year . We felt   this was a high target but we knew we could do it- if we asked the right questions and got the right   solution together with our customers . 

 Selection : 

 Having reviewed the different tools , we chose to go with the Learning Launch , as the purpose was to   learn and then improve through running experiments and gathering insights and feedback from real   customers .   The learning launch gave us an opportunity to test , learn and improve on the chat bot   service so we could scale it up to drive engagement and usage with the customers . 

 Application : 

 We started the process by first developing a working prototype accessible to customers on an   application they already use to minimize any barriers to them testing the chat bot service . 

 As the team was already working in agile , we were able to develop this within a couple of sprints and   ensured the integrations to internal systems were working well . 

 For the first phase of the learning launch , we engaged a number of customers using our online platforms   and informed them we were testing the chat bot service and needed them to give us feedback and   suggestions on services and features they wanted . We ran this for a period of 3 weeks and collected the   feedback both online and within the bot . 

 After reviewing the feedback from the users and suggestions on what we could do to improve the   service , we spent some more time in development and worked on the quick wins we identified from the   insights and road mapped the items that were more complex and required more time to integrate . 

 We then took an updated prototype to the customers and observed usage of some of the new features   as well as received additional feedback and this helped firm up the preferred customer journey and   method to engage with the customers using the chat bot before the full launch with a more aggressive   Go to Market campaign . 

 Insight : 

 From the learning launch model , we learnt the need to let go of some of the things we thought would   work and was relevant to us but was not that relevant to the customer . We also got additional insights   on the importance of personalization where the customers want the bot to greet them using their own   names and to have additional features that are not necessarily linked to self - service . This insight helped   us introduce brainteasers and riddles to the bot and increased the relatability with especially the   younger users who are the majority of the customers using digital platforms . 

 These insights together with the others picked during the learning launch phases really helped us launch   a chat bot that stood out from the other corporates and enabled us to achieve the desired growth in   penetration . 

 Reviewing the suggestions and feedback continuously from the customers and acting on it is necessary   for the long - term success of any product . 

 Approach : 

 From the experience we had as a team and a better understanding of Design Thinking through   additional training , we would still use the Learning Launch tool as this enables us to test a hypothesis ,   experiment and pick learnings that will create more value . 

 We would however refine the questions we were asking to get deeper and better insights that would   enable us develop more innovative features that will drive repeat use by the customers and higher   engagement as we meet the business objective to increase self - service usage .

"Visualization       Ads captivate our eyes with their striking colors , catchy phrases , incredible images , and   a myriad of innovative designs .   All this gives life to a visual advertising which makes viewers feel transported and   can not get that advertising out of their minds , for this I could mention a series of   points to highlight to achieve success in it .     The color ; There is a theory of the psychology of color , which implies the stimulation of   the human eye through colors , contrasts that have an impact and give recognition to   the product or article to be promoted .   An example of how striking colors can be in a brand or product to highlight brands   such as <ADDRESS> with their bright yellow , the predominant red of Coca - Cola , the   blue of Dominos Pizza , which are franchises which , due to their vibrant colors , are   <NAME> for adults and children .     A catchy phrase ; a memorable slogan that are words that define a brand and that   generally accompany the advertising to be promoted .   It adds meaning to the logo and helps establish the brand in the market .   The slogan not only represents the brand , but also identifies the consumer , that is why   devising a creative phrase must be assertive for those who read it .     An image to stand out is very important since we make our product known about it . In   the case of tourist advertisements , a photograph of the destination makes customers   have a greater interest in knowing as well as remembering our advertisement .   Also items such as cars , drinks , cell phones , clothing and many others .     A balanced minimalist design that makes that visual connection with the clients who   view these advertisements , playing with colors , shapes , images and phrases .   Personally , people nowadays give little interest to publications loaded with   information or content , so setting specific things makes it more feasible and effective   to publicize the product .   But the most important thing in creating an advertisement is to let ideas flow and   create the unimaginable for our eyes .

"Reﬂection Assignment - Mind Mapping ; 

 Challenge & Selection : 

 This tool is helpful in many daily situations of our lives and an amazing way to 

 make things easier and more eﬃcient . Besides that , mind mapping makes innovation 

 easier to be applied . I work as a designer in a student association whose mission is 

 auxiliate in the development of the social sector , personal development of its members 

 and the awareness of social environmental causes through events , consulting and 

 incubation . 

 I often use the mind mapping tool to create more empathy between the 

 students and our clients . It is really important so we can see many ways to do 

 something and actually innovate . In the social sector this is so useful , specially because 

 we have to focus on the people who will beneﬁt from this idea and be aware so we do n’t 

 get lost with the operation part , focusing too much only on the business side and 

 forgetting what is the real goal . In that way , I often use maps to be able to create a 

 journey and focus on each step but not forgetting about the “ bigger ” map . 

 Application : 

 I usually start things with mind mapping so we can understand how to create a 

 good journey for the people who will beneﬁt from this idea . In this student association , 

 we work with social impact business . For those people who do n’t know what this is , I will 

 explain in a very easy way . They are businesses that have social impact but also operate 

 according to the logic of proﬁt , which is really diﬀerent from the third sector that people 

 usually associate when someone talks about the social sector . 

 In that way , we need to create a journey connected to the social side of the idea 

 but also think about how we can make proﬁt for the entrepreneur . Therefore , we 

 extract meaning from data in a way that lets patterns and insights emerge . Patterns and 

 insights we might otherwise have missed . Usually , we use a Post It or a board to write 

 the data that we already have and we put the outliers also . Creating a complete mind 

 map of our client ’s business . Sometimes , we even do that in small areas of the business , 

 trying to make it more detailed as possible . Unfortunately , with the crisis caused by the 

 pandemic , we had to move all of our activities to the online world . In a certain way , that 

 was good because now we can reach many areas that we could n’t before ( I live in <ADDRESS> , 

 a very large country and full of diﬀerent cultures ) but we had to adaptate our methods . 

 Now we use Miro or even Google Docs to generate mind maps . We usually start 

 by the name of the business , following by its goal , people in social vulnerability who will 

 beneﬁt from this , where the proﬁt will come from and who will buy these product or 

 service ( most of the times , the people who will beneﬁt from this idea are not the same 

 that will buy the product or service generated by the idea ) . And then we emerge into 

 these ideas , studying more about each topic . Besides that , many other topics come 

 from this initial and main topics . In the end , we usually have a really complete mind 

 mapping of the business . 

 We have three diﬀerent areas in this student association : events , consulting and 

 incubation . I ’m an Incubator Design and we have 20 people working in this area , divided 

 into three diﬀerent clients . Each team has 4 Designers and 1 manager , besides the 

 management team that do n't work directly in project ’s areas . In that way , 5 diﬀerent 

 people make the mind map . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 Concluding this , I have learned so much from mind maps and this is such a great 

 tool for work and also on daily problems that we have to face . It is really important so 

 we can actually understand each step , do not let anything important go by and focus on 

 the important thing . Also , mind mapping is looking for patterns and insights . We can get 

 together all data and ﬁnd patterns , besides having insights that are so important for us and 

 our stakeholders . Most of the time , it makes us see other ways to do that speciﬁc thing , 

 innovating and being more successful . Maybe what I think would be nice doing in a diﬀerent 

 way is making the mind mapping easier to understand for other people that do n’t have the 

 same knowledge about the project . In that way , we can see if it makes sense for them , if 

 they have new ideas that we did n't have and try to have the concern to construct it in a way 

 that all people can understand .

"Example Reflection – Mind Mapping     Challenge 

 For my project I decided to focus on our <ADDRESS> bakery . the idea of open a bakery started 7 years   ago , it was run by my mother and my dad , both with knowledge on the pastry and bakery   industry . 

 At first it was a popular bakery on the town , with lots of customers and an exhausted amount of   work , but the years went by and it lost the popularity that has gain . 

 There are many reasons that can explain the why to this situation , but the most important for me   is , that the menu was never change , always stay simple , the bakery did n’t progress with the   society , always selling the same products with the same Price and the same earnings . 

 My idea is to include express service , but with three changes that make it different from others 

 First of all , the express service can be done by transportation that it did not required gasoline , like   skates , skate boards or bicycles . the second thing is that the containers , bags , boxes and any other   method of baling , needed to be nature - friendly , for example , the plastic bags : a usual plastic bag   has a deterioration process of 150 years while paper bags and boxes just take one or two years to   deteriorate . And the last but not least idea was to put motivational notes on the breakfast , this   actually make the costumer happier and comfortable with the product and the seller . 

 Selection 

 For my challenge I decide to use the design Thinking tool of mind mapping . 

 Mind mapping as we learn is a diagram of visualization that allow us to represent an idea through   short words , drawings , collages , etc . this tool it help us think , collect information , create ideas and   represent them by a paper . This is actually the favorite tool for a lot of managers . 

 I chose to use these tool on my challenge because I think that it can capture more the attention of   employees and customers . This method allows me to represent my idea in a way that the person   can comprehend easily and fast , at the same time I think it attracts more the human eye , what can   help in case you want a partner . 

 Application 

 I applied this method on my challenge by creating a kind of poster , I divided it in four and on each   part I put what I thought were the most important ideas of all the project . 

 In the first part I put all the information of our bakery at the moment . Like why it was created , who   did it , when , the bills 7 years ago and the ones in the present , also the role of each member of the   family when it comes to the bakery . 

 For the second part I put de disadvantage of the actual situation in general for our store and add   the reasons why the amount of costumers decreases , in this case the pandemic and the lack of   new products and menus . 

 In the third part I explained my idea . I resumed it to three pillars , for me the most required ones   and marc the pros or the vantages of each one , in this part I wanted to put in highlight what the   bakery will look in the future if we implement the idea I created . 

 And for the last part I represent which could be the obstacles for this idea and the solution that I   gave to all of them . 

 Insight 

 Elaborating all of this project make me learn the importance that it takes to have a good   relationship with the costumers and the employees , the simple act of putting notes on their   breakfast lift their mood in matter of seconds and the fact that they have the number of the actual   boss of the bakery to ask for some breakfast make them feel a high amount of confidence . That   cause that the costumer has a feeling of warm and the act of just order make them happy.it also   helps relieve a lot of stress by the rest of the day , if they started with a good mood they will end it   the same way . and all of this is really not easy , you need time , data and personal interest . 

 Other thing that I learned was that an idea can change for better or worse depending of the   reaction and judgment of the society with it . When my family and employees putt the notes with   their opinions of my idea , some of them actually turn nonsense , and change a lot my perspective   and with it the way I felt about the project . 

 Approach 

 The next time I will in the first place make things more effectible , this because I hope that with the   time I gain more knowledge about design thinking and the mind mapping tool . 

 I also will make more deep investigation which allows me to create more big and brilliants ideas   for solving problems . And I will improve the methods to increase the good relationship with the   costumers . 

 Probably the tool of mind mapping is my favorite one but in next projects I will use the others to   investigate and discover which tool will act more effectible depending on the problem .

"It is often seen that the central government establishes modeling for economic growth based on   economic theory that adjusts the slowdown and direction of economic flows with interest rates and   currency , and local governments are agonizing through various policy mixes to create economic growth   momentum in declining regions . However , in order to create sustainable virtuous cycle growth in   Korean society and economy using new digital technologies , design based on behavioral science such   as economics , sociology , and welfare is important , and designing and experimenting with the   transaction structure connecting the public and the private sector is not an easy topic . I ca n't help but   think about the reason . 

 It is an era in which it is necessary to understand the system dynamics of the impact of digital new   technology called self - driving cars on the economy and society , and to design healthy economic growth   based on that understanding . Establishing a scenario for the transaction structure of economic growth   and storytelling of the growth roadmap can begin with Design Thinking . Recently , in smart cities , self- driving trams for alley Last Mile , online to offline traditional markets through 5G - based ultra - HD high- resolution multi - channel live broadcasts , and "" people of delivery "" policies that carry welfare services   for vulnerable and undernourished children . In addition , it is time to design thinking - based service   design as a detailed sketch of "" saving the Korean economy as a whole "" that will sustain the healthy   ecosystem . 

 Vision AI , Light Detection And Ranging , <NAME> , live broadcasting transaction information for   traditional markets , and delivery national welfare service performance information accumulate through   digital new technologies , and are economic signals showing the transaction structure and economic   flow of stakeholders constituting the Korean economy . When new signals that were not seen in the past   are collected and measured , it is easy to predict that policy goals to be achieved naturally and what KPI   are to be designed , monitored , analyzed , and redesigned . So far , if the local economy has been   a career- oriented welfare voucher transaction , in the future , new economic signals will be collected and healthy   growth - type transaction structures will be designed and measured to see if local economic policy goals   have been achieved . Using signals from the local economy that have not been noted so far as raw   materials , creating a virtuous cycle of economic structure like mud with Design Thinking can be self- driving cars and economic growth policies in the digital transition period . 

 Sketching the roadmap for the development of the future mobility industry ecosystem means <NAME>   of the value chain . In the past , the automobile industry has vertically integrated the value chain of the   automobile industry through the technology of engines and drive systems , which are the core   technologies of internal combustion engines . However , as the core technologies of future automobiles   change and the importance of technologies transplanted from other industries such as chemistry ,   electronics , IT , and software increases , horizontal and cooperative value chain construction is required . 

 In addition , changes and innovations in the future mobility industry are not limited to manufacturing   areas . The production and sales of automobiles are being incorporated into a part of the comprehensive   mobility industry , and are developing into a Convergence Science industry that is no longer limited to   mechanical engineering . It is expected that products and services in the mobility industry will be   provided in a fused form centering on the spatial experience experienced by consumers , and that a   healthy virtuous cycle of related ecosystems will be possible . Through this , it is possible to create a new   national wealth in the global market beyond the scope of infrastructure and space of the autonomous   driving and future mobility industries existing in <ADDRESS> . If design thinking in the past is centered on   HW , it is now an era in which invisible services are designed , service design in which the direction and   size of the growth roadmap vary depending on the design , and even ecosystem design are needed .

"Peer - graded Assignment : Storytelling 

 By <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 <NAME> is the perfect tool for my work , which helps me share and link my lived experience with my work . Here is tory of my work . 

 There is a saying , ‘ go where the problems are ’ which tells people from outside to come and work for the development of locals . But we stand to be different by saying ‘ build the leaders where the problems are . ’ Because we believe in local leaders to address local 

 problems not outsiders . It only will lead to the goal of what we say sustainable 

 development . Hence we aim to build development leadership among youth from 

 grassroots to help them become actors of their own development . We recognize that 

 higher education as a crucial tool to cultivate leadership among them . At MAYA firm we support them to pursue higher education in premier institutes of higher education , 

 especially in the field of humanities and social sciences which would help them to realize their potentials and build their capacities to start a career in the development sector and eventually become development leaders . Our target group is those who are largely underrepresented in higher education which are the first generation learners , 

 attended schools in Marathi or vernacular medium , rural youth coming from 

 educationally and socially underprivileged families including dalit , adivasis and nomadic tribes . Due to lack of awareness , aspiration , reference , mentorship and guidance they remained underrepresented in higher education . Their representation is even worse in premier institutes like IITs , IIMs , TISS and Central Universities etc . We want to send more and more underprivileged students to premier institutes of higher education and enable them to address their own problems . 

 Our Approach : 

 At MAYA firm Academy we mentor , guide and train underprivileged students as a preparation to enter and study in the premier institutes of higher education to realize their potential and build their capacity to become development agents . For this , we organize 

 seminars and residential workshops in rural parts of <ADDRESS> and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra by collaborating with the local colleges to reach our target group . 

 Through these events we sensitize them , raise their aspiration , build their perspective and orient them with higher education opportunities . Through these events we have reached out to more than 5000 rural youth during the last three years . After the seminars and workshop we identify those who are interested to pursue higher education in premier institutes for 3 months residential preparatory course where we guide them for preparation of entrance exams and interviews . We have also designed 3 months residential courses for those who have at least graduated in social science or social work to build their skills and attitude essential for development professional . For all these 

 programs we engage various experienced faculties , professionals and resource persons from different disciplines to mentor , guide and train our students towards the leadership goal . 

 With constant efforts since 2017 more than 100 underprivileged youth have entered various premier higher education institutes and got fellowships in the development 

 sector . Some of them have started their career in this field and are striving as 

 development leaders .

"Reflection - Mind Mapping     Challenge   I work for an international payroll outsourcing company . Our company runs payroll on behalf of   our customers . By doing so our customers can spend their Human Resources on strategic HR   initiatives that are not payroll administration related . We operate large call centers in different   parts of the world . Our agents logon to a Ticketing tool to solve customer inquiries related to   payroll and HR . I recently found out that there is no integration between our knowledge base   and the ticketing system and that our agents are spending too much time finding the answer to   an inquiry . I decided to use the mind mapping tool to visualize this problem .     Selection   The reason I selected the mind mapping tool discussed during Week 3 of the coursera course is   that I felt I did not know which design criteria the solution should have to be effective for our   company . I did not know enough about how our agents are solving tickets ; i.e. the current   reality of tools and processes . I also believe that a visual picture of the “ What is ” is easier to   explain then a long word or email report that few find the time to read . I also watched a few   youtubes on how to effectively do mind mapping including a youtube from <NAME> <NAME> ( The   inventor of <NAME> <NAME> ) . A draft of my mind map is below .     Application   I asked colleagues from 3 call center locations to conduct interviews with agents , I also did   some myself . I talked to experienced and inexperienced agents and agents with diverse   backgrounds to make sure I did not get single - sided - data . I also sat next to agents to observe   behavior . I collected all this info in excel sheets and then looked for “ insights ” and common   themes .   I created a mind map to visualize correlations . The mind map produced initial design   criteria . We also collected quantitative data from our ticketing system to learn more about   which tickets are getting answered slower than others and about the profile of the agent .     Insight   We learned that most agents are aware that an internal knowledge base exists but found the   tool ineffective for solving customer queries because of following key elements : 

 -   No search capability , therefor finding info is trial and error , navigating through a tree   structure of documents 

 -   Agents keeping their own “ notepad ” of standard answers because accessing the   company knowledge base is slow ( speed of opening the tool ) , so they started to create   their own local version 

 -   Lack of reward in submitting knowledge articles and no clear education on how to get   the knowledge base updated . 

 By using mind mapping we found a series of tools and info sources that teams are using that   the company was not aware off . This was a great insight . Our initial focus would have been to   move all content from pdf and word documents into a HTML based searchable website but we   learned that our focus should be more on finding ways to make sure the knowledge base   content stays fresh and accurate and on designing a recognition process to reward agents that 

 share and create knowledge articles as this is a task that goes beyond solving an actual   customer inquiry .         Approach   Applying the mind mapping method to our challenge allowed me to really force my team to go   out in the field and talk and observe people and to document their findings . Too often we   assume we know what the problem and the current state is . In the future I would try to create   the mind map with more people to make sure people do n’t think this a my “ State of mind ” . I   will start looking for tools to do this more in a collaborative way while dealing with the   constraints of a “ remote ” work environment . My team works in different offices around the   world and there is no travel budget to do these activities face to face .        <NAME> - <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME>

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge   I am part of Human Resource Center of Expertise team and our challenge was to launch the   Learning and Development framework for the organization . Our organization is made of up of 6   different entities operating out of different geographies . Our aim was to bring the entire   organization under one L&D framework . The project scope included interviews from   employees , Business Unit Heads , HR on the learning needs of the employees , and the learning   and development requirements from business .      Selection   Our team had already signed an online learning portal with whom we were to collaborate for   the training content . Our team went through several design thinking activities / tools , to   consolidate the learning content into programs that are relevant for our employees and   business , so we are ready to try the learning launch tool .      Application   For our first application , we focused on a small group of employees pertaining to few business   units . We provided them with a predefined set of courses that they were required to do . The   courses were selected for each employee by their managers . We wanted to gauge how the   employees felt about the learning programs that they were provided . This tested our   assumption that the structure and execution were the main challenge that we were facing in   encouraging employees to take up learning . Our team got together and ran a mini survey with   these selected employees to understand why they were not interested in taking up learning .    What we learnt was that employees wanted a broader catalogue of courses to choose from and   to be able to choose their own courses and not limited by the mandatory choice made by HR or   their manager . Next , our team went through the program catalogues and instead of making it   employee specific we made it business unit specific ; i.e. employees could view a variety of   courses to choose from which were aligned to the competencies that were required for the   development and growth of the business unit .      For our second launch , we focused on giving the employee a catalogue of courses to choose   form . A choice to learn the courses that they felt were most appropriate to hone their   competencies . While we kept the larger objective i.e. talent development to align with business   goals , we opened the learning programs for employees . This allowed employees to take charge   of their skills and competencies development . Instead of allocating a course to an employee , a   catalogue of courses were given to employee to choose from . 

 Insights    By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified our assumptions and designed   launches to test these assumptions . We thought through anticipated results , expecting to find   that a more agile approach would help improve adoption of learning and that both our   employees and Business unit heads would be open to the new concept of allowing employees   to take charge of their learning by selected the courses from the learning catalogues . Moving   forward , our team will review this insight and incorporate it into future launch designs . The   ongoing incorporation of insight is particularly important at this stage , as launches come before   a full rollout in the design thinking timeline .       Approach    Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools and are at   this stage in the timeline , the learning launch is the appropriate tool . We will review the insight   gained from our first two launches and incorporate this insight into future launch designs for   the launch of the modules within our Learning and Development framework .

"Reﬂec%on – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selec%on 

 I am currently working in one of the biggest banks in <ADDRESS> and was presented with a simple challenge . 

 How can the team transform our banking app to be more than just a u < lity app where people just come to 

 transfer money or check their account balance . This project was ini < ated as a part of our branding revamp 

 ini < a < ves in order to a?ract younger audience such as young professionals and millennials . It involved not 

 only a huge number of employees from diﬀerent departments such as business development , marke < ng , 

 product , legal , technology , data , and design . But also various consultancy agencies and vendors s to help us 

 deliver the solu < ons faster and be?er . 

 I picked mind - mapping as it is a great tool to expand our horizon in deﬁning what is possible op < ons and 

 solu < ons . Basically mind map is a visual representa < on tool that connects diﬀerent thoughts , concepts , 

 ideas , or even process in order for us to focus or even ﬁnd a solu < on to a par < cular problem or challenge . 

 Applica%on 

 At ﬁrst mee < ng , we tried to analyse on what is currently present within our applica < on . By doing so , we 

 have a clear picture of what we have and what we do n’t have . Then we con < nue to deﬁne our customer 

 segmenta < on by crea < ng porto - persona . We also created a set of general expecta < ons , pain points , and 

 needs for each segmenta < on , then we created a user interview script which purpose to uncover their 

 experiences , ways of achieving their goals through our mobile applica < on , and things they wish existed in 

 the app . 

 Next mee < ng , we invited some of actual users to be interviewed and tested our assump < ons and see which 

 one was accurate . AKer that we tried to synthesise the insights and use this to see exci < ng possibili < es 

 using mind map . Having done it , now the team can clearly see how each insights can form a connec < on 

 through diﬀerent perspec < ve and eventually touching the core challenge . The mind map can be found here : 

 <URL> 

 Insight 

 By applying mind map , my team was able to iden < fy opportuni < es , ideas , and connec < ons . We could also 

 see how accurate our assump < ons are and how it connects with diﬀerent personas . Last but not least , we 

 managed to bring the same understanding , even though we all came from diﬀerent teams and 

 backgrounds . It also gave a sense of ownership and connec < on to each member , making the project much 

 more exci < ng to be done . 

 Approach

"DESIGN THINKING- STORYTELLING 

 CHALLENGE 

 I had to convince a local gym franchise to create a more positive atmosphere for its members   who had started leaving and the management wanted to learn the reason for customers   leaving . The root cause seemed to lie in the depreciating quality of gym equipments and the   lack of maintenance at proper intervals . The problem turned out to be much worse . Majority of   the management was arrogant and was not very responsive to the consumer demands , thinking   that the money saved is the money in pocket . Consumers on the other hand , seemed   disconnected with the fact that even a small issue of “ not playing the ‘ proper ’ workout music ”   could leave a mark of sloppiness in the eyes of consumers . This hurt feeling led the consumers   to leave more frequently . The challenge remained that how can we create a more open   consumer atmosphere . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 I believe that <NAME> is a powerful tool to inspire both consumers and the employees to   make the better judgment . Storytelling can inspire people in ways they can connect and help   them in ways unrecognizable . People draw analogies from the story and project that story on   them to see cause . 

 APPLICATION 

 I engaged with the team to tell them a story about how empathy can carve a way to a better   value creation for stakeholders . I told them a story about two shopkeepers , let ’s call them <NAME>   and <NAME> . So , <NAME> had a very peculiar way of approaching his customers . Whenever there was   no stock available in the store for a particular demand for a customer , he used to ask them to   come later . Things used to get worse when customers used to call back to check on the   products , <NAME> used to yell , “ I will tell you , when products get in . Do n’t call and create a fuss ” .   Consumers felt offended and started looking for a store that knew how to respect them .   Shortly , <NAME> opened a new store . Treated customers with a smile , respected their calls and   slowly customers started to move towards <NAME> . 

 Not to my surprise , <NAME> went out of business and started begging the older customers by calling   them back . Some customers did come back . But it only took them a while to understand that   the shopkeeper still has n’t learnt to respect . In short term , an illusion of change works but if   someone wishes to see in long run , the customers will definitely see through the façade . In a   relatively short time , <NAME> dominated the market and <NAME> , well ; let ’s just say he retired , keeping   it a little respectful . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 Upon speaking with the gym ’s owner , observing the gym ’s manager ’s behavior , and several   consumers , I realized that the problem goes into the root cause , “ the ego ” . As the gym is known   for its low cost , the managers feel that the consumers do n’t deserve the services they demand .   The managers intimidate and get offensive with the customers whenever they demanded that   the necessary work be done . 

 After listening to the story , the managers realized that the customers are the most important   parameter of the entire operation and creating value for them is the only thing keeping them   viable . Just by inviting the old customers into the gym and still making no positive changes to   the gym , they will run the gym into ground . 

 The approach would also have worked with mind mapping , where the gym managers would   need to understand what is and reflect on themselves . Create a chart that would track the   needs and customers ideas ( knowing their persona ) and then brainstorm ideas to make the gym   better . 

 However , by storytelling , the crux of the issue could be addressed by a third party . If the   managers are more self aware and accept criticism well , the gym would better able to create   value .

"Smart cities for citizens 

 <NAME> ): 

 To involve in the project of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> to ALL the citizens , including children and older persons .   For   children , the initial challenge is how to explain what is a <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , to have an understanding , and to be   happy with the project . 

 For a city , it would be important that families can see that the family obtain benefits with a project of   "" <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> "" , and this is why children have a role seeing why this is positive and funny for them . 

 In the case of the older population , they would need to identify clear benefits for them , for example by   supporting their health , by having better conditions in the city or transports . 

 Selection : 

 In these two cases , both for children and older persons , it is not easy to explain questions related to   technology , as is the case for services provided by a <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . 

 And this is why “ Visualization ” can be very useful , and if we are considering a “ comic ” , then we are also   using “ Storytelling ” . 

 So , my selection will be a combination of both . 

 Application : 

 Visualization when talking of a city is very useful as many different services can be optimized , and both   children and older persons would understand better if they see an image . 

 In a comic like the one I used , there is also a Character introducing the subjects and telling a story . 

 In this way , you can be ensuring that the “ audience ” is correctly understanding , as in the picture of   buses to go to the school , where the presenter character can explain that good traffic coordination   would allow getting on time to school in the case of children . 

 For the case of older persons is the same if they have to go to a hospital or to visit their sons .   Storytelling allows visually concatenating a sequence of benefits , simulating an experience like a day in a   City . 

 Insights & Approach 

 The result confirmed our thoughts about how a comic can be convenient for these types of users ,    mainly for children . 

 The approach was completed or complemented with a robot that could answer questions from them . 

 In the case of older persons , it is also more interesting for them to have such a format . A picture is   clearer than a long description . 

 And , the approach more effective is when the story of the comic is a practical situation , for example ,   related to health , to transport improvements . And additionally , may be interesting to use new   technology as intelligent devices ( Smartwatch ) to control a correct heart performance avoiding going to   the hospital .

"Assignment – Reflection – Mind mapping 

 by <NAME> <NAME> 

 1 . Challenge 

 There are many actions that we want to do but we are insecure , however if we use the 

 correct methods we can facilitate the way we carry out our projects . I have a research project that needed to be done , but I was unsure . However , I realized that I could overcome this challenge by using some sort of tool because I knew what I needed to do , but I needed to keep everything organized in the sequence of steps and relationships between ideas . The project was a research on social entrepreneurship and its relation to social innovation . The purpose was to make an article that could   bring   the   relationships   between   the   dimensions   and   concepts   involved   in   the   social entrepreneurship and social innovation from the studies made in the two themes . So what was needed had already been done that was the study of the two themes , but what was missing was to make the relationship between the two . Hence the need for a tool to assist in this process and to achieve better success in this challenge . 

 2 . Selection 

 From the characteristics of the presented challenge , the best way I found to unite the 

 concepts of social entrepreneurship and social innovation was to use the mind mapping tool . As said in the course video : "" <NAME> <NAME> is looking for patterns and insights in a large amount of data collected during your exploration of what the current reality is "" and in this sense the large amount of readings I performed needed this kind of exploration and Analysis trying in a more synthetic and visual way to identify the common points for the approaches of the chosen themes . In this sense , the selection of the tool was adequate for this phase of the solution of the problem for the creation of the article because it shapes what is needed for this moment . 

 3 . Application 

 After selecting the tool , checking its potential for the exploration phase and its need to create 

 the article , it was possible to see its effective action for the moment . However , the way the tool was applied required the use of technological resources , since it was necessary to install a computer program that could help in the construction of the mind map of the article . I searched the internet for an application and found <NAME> <NAME> that is installed in Google Chrome and from there I was inserting the concepts of social entrepreneurship and social innovation and searching for their connections . First , in the center was placed the social entrepreneurship and from there I was separating the connections that were related to entrepreneurship in general and social action also in general , seeking out and separating in us distinct what would be more distant from the central term And closer to other terms . 

 4 . Insight 

 The contribution that the application of the tool brought as insight into finishing the 

 development   of   the   connections   of   the   terms   for   the   article   was   the   direct   relation   that entrepreneurship causes in relation to social innovation , but that helped me to organize the ideas of a more hierarchical way verifying what Which was more important and was close to the concept , as well as what was further away from the concept and could not have a prominence in the article . Another important point is also that the concepts that were closer in the mapping brought a sense of what thematic field could be developed . In this way , the dispersion in the readings made for the two terms was reduced with time and with the completion of the mind map . 

 5 . Approach 

 The way the work was developed had an approach based on the concepts and their relations 

 given the objective that was to construct an article for this purpose . However , this approach may be different and in other works can be modified . For example , instead of a relationship between concepts , the tool may have the same purpose , but instead of relating the concepts , a network of connections may also be made looking for the relationships between authors . Thus , this other approach may also serve to verify which connections from the point of view of the authors ' schools or lines of thought . 

 Finally , to the end that was applied the tool perfectly served the purpose and brought more 

 dynamics   to   the   process   of   linking   ideas   to   the   research   project .   Therefore ,   because   of   its effectiveness , it will also be used at other times when there is a similar problem . The experience was very successful and motivating .

"Example : Gaining Highlights through Storytelling 

 Challenge : I work for a very young start - up that offers travel experiences , stays and the world   around it ! Back when the challenge had emerged , the start - up was hardly 3 - 4 months old ; facing   severe issues to gain momentum given the light of predominant competitors like Airbnb ,   Booking.com and the like . 

 We were in a position of stagnancy as no ‘ positive ’ growth or trend was to be seen even if we were   to do some forecasting by ourselves . Henceforth , the team of 3 – my cofounders and I decided to sit   together to brainstorm one night to see is there ’s something viable that can be done to help us in   growing . None of us had a marketing background and I , myself am just a fresh graduate ! 

 Selection : During that night , we were having prompt discussions but somehow , I found it so boring   because I knew that nothing fruitful is n’t going to come out of it . Until , I thought of Storytelling ! The   idea was inspired on the same lines of ‘ Humans of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ’ where what if “ we start writing the   stories of our clients and suppliers in order to have that respectable and amiable touch or essentially   – to have an indestructible rapport . ” 

 Application : It was smooth and quite simple . If you ’re familiar with contracting ; each time we had to   sit together to let a ‘ supplier ’ come in contract with us . To show some trust - worthiness on our part , I   used to story - tell our business idea and model and in return I used to ask their stories of life for   which I have written multiple essays and articles manifesting their arduous yet gratifying life   experiences . While this application had no prior research or forecasting done ; with a simple - gut   feeling of the three of us , we went ahead with some experimentation for the coming 2 months . 

 Result : Effective – 100 % . Efficient – still to be reached . Why ? Storytelling requires a good amount of   time for investment and hence we lagged on other aspects of a business such as application design ,   bookings , marking etc . As of now , we ’re looking for a college intern who ’s into writing stories , has a   good grasp on the language . 

 Insight : What I got to know from this experimentation was that people do n’t really come to fall in   love with ideas , experiences or anything else for that matter , unless it has something ‘ personal ’ ( a   feeling , emotion , appreciation , disgust etc . ) attached to it . No matter how big or small the person ,   industry etc . is ; they all look for something to connect with even if it ’s a plain transactional activity .   Hence , we too having a business mind - set realised the potential behind this and have been tapping   the benefits ever since ! 

 Our Instagram followers have reached 4036 , prior to this experiment , we were at 2512 . 

 Cheers !

"Reflection - Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I 'm a lawyer in a bank . My expertise is corporate and bankruptcy law . In one of the   cases I dealt with , a customer of the bank was given a loan while his house was   supposed to be the guarantee for the debt . The customer told the banker that the   house is a big private house in one of the richest cities in the country , and so it is worth   a lot more than the loan that he was asking for . In the worst case , if he wo n't be able   to pay the loan , the house can be sold and his debt will be paid . 

 After the loan was not paid on time , we demanded the customer to follow his   commitment and sell his house in order to pay his debt . Only then we found out that   the house was not his house at all . Unfortunately , although there is a special   procedure in the bank , describing all the things the bankers must check in order to   relay on the customers assets as a guarantee , the banker , in this case , did not follow   the procedure as he should have been . 

 In order to prevent this event from happening again , my challenge was to guide the   bankers to work according to the bank special procedure , regarding customers assets   as a guarantee , in a series of lectures that were organized by their supervisors . 

 Selection 

 The tool I selected to use was the Visualization Tool ( Module 1 - video number 5 ) . By   using this tool , you use visuals like photographs , videos , diagrams , colors , symbols ,   images , logos etc . instead of using words . By doing so it is more likely that your   audience will understand your message better and remember it . 

 I selected this tool to my challenge since the procedure I had to talk about in my   lectures was long ( over 30 pages ) and complex procedure . Moreover , it was important   to me that the bankers remember as much as possible from the lectures and I figured   that by using visuals ( photographs and symbols ) the important details in my lectures   will be more rememberable . 

 Application & Insight 

 I applied the Visualization Tool in my lectures by creating a slide show including a lot   of symbols in it . I divided the procedure into separated steps and decided to give each   of them an individual symbol to represent them ( For example , to describe the step in   which the banker should check the value of the asset I used a scale symbol ) . In each   slide there were the symbol and a short explanation of the procedure step described   by the symbol . At the end of the slide show there was a diagram which only contained   the symbols with arrows in between them showing the direction from one step to the   other . 

 My insight from applying the Visualization Tool to my challenge was how effectively   visuals deliver the message and making it easier to remember , especially when the   topic is long and complex ( like 30 pages bank procedure ) . Apparently , the symbols I 

 used were so rememberable that I did n't even had to explain them when I presented   the final diagram . The bankers , already know what they mean and remembered which   of the symbols , representing the next step in the procedure , comes next . 

 These days , with so much information and so many distractions around us , it is   important to be able to deliver a short and rememberable message effectively . As I   discovered , by using the Visualization Tool , using visuals can help you do that   effectively . 

 Approach 

 Although the Visualization Tool proved itself and helped the bankers remember all the   procedure steps , it was important to me that they will also understand the importance   of this procedure so their work will not only be technical work . Therefore , in my next   lectures I decided to also use the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . I began the lectures by telling the   bankers the story about the customer house ( that turned out that was n't his house ) ,   so they can understand the importance of the procedure and only after they did , I   began my slide show with all the visual steps ( the symbols ) of the procedure , making   them easier to remember it .

"Reflection on VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge : 

 Our organization has a training course for auditors in timber industry . In timber industry , there are   different types of factories : harvesting , sawing , chipping , furniture making , warehouse , etc … With   different operations , the set up in the factories and warehouses are different and hence , the risks , which   depends on critical points of control , also varies . What we need after the training is that the trainees have   to understand different operations , and then identify the critical points of control and find the risks . We   must find the most efficient way to provide those knowledges to people with different background . 

 Selection : 

 We decided to use Visualization tool in order to create a shared understanding and imagination of   different operations .    We imagined that if we just use words to explain this part , different trainees would   think and imagine differently . So using pictures / drawing , it would be easier for the trainees to understand   and imagine . We also have trainees from different background , so we would ask the collaboration and   contribution from all of them to develop the most accurate visual of different operations . 

 Application : 

 So with the application , we ask the trainees to draw the map of an timber processing enterprise from   input to output , and identify the critical points of control that they know or they are working in on a piece   of A4 paper . To make sure that we cover the most types of operation as possible , we have a small   discussion at the beginning for the trainees to assign / choose which one they would like to draw . After the   individual working time , the class get together , each person presents their picture to the whole group . The   group then have the opportunity to discuss , share their insights and add / revise the details of each   drawing . 

 Insight : 

 With the exercise , the trainees have a big picture of all the operations / processes that they will work with   in their job . It is really interesting to engage different people with diverse range of experiences in the   process of co - creating the pictures . Through the visual creating process , each participant gains their   knowledge , not only from the instructor , but also from other learners in the class . The main valuable   aspect of this exercise is the shared insights and shared learning process . The tool not only makes it easy   for a diverse group people to imagine and remember the details , but also create the opportunity for the   participants to share their perspectives and develop insights into the topic .   From the drawings , the   participants then can easily dig down to further details in the whole process of timber manufacturing , i.e.   the associated risks , and then risk mitigation measures . It is also useful for the development of   management plan for the factory . 

 Approach : 

 After the process , we are thinking of doing it a bit differently , for example : doing in group , and ask the   participants to prepare some photographs before the course , and see if the exercise can be more   interesting and effective . With bigger group of participants , maybe group work would be better and easier   to manage within a limited time . Also , with real pictures of the operations , it would be easier for the   participants to visualize and understand .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I am the head of the commercial team in the branch of our company . My goal is to ensure that the   effective work of the team allows you to achieve the business objectives assigned to the branch in   conditions of limited resources : budget , timing , competitors . 

 In the process of working with the team we often gather for brainstorming sessions . During such   meetings , one of the visualization tools is Ishikawa charts or "" FishBone "" diagrams . This method helps me   to achieve a common understanding of the problem by all the team members performing different   functions : marketing , sales , developers of product offers , customer service . After preliminary analysis by   all stakeholders of cause - effect relationships , influencing factors and possible problems , the relevant   conclusions and decisions are reached in a shorter time , and the decisions made are more effective . 

 Application 

 We begin the formation of the diagram with a clear formulation of the key problem , the solution of   which is for the team . Next , I ask each member of the team to describe their individual vision of all the   influencing factors by uniting them into groups : employees , work processes , machinery and equipment ,   materials used , as well as the actions of competitors and regulatory / supervisory authorities . Also on   the diagram we leave a special place for things that can not be immediately distributed into one or   another category . This leaves room for unconventional ideas and creativity . 

 After each participant expressed his opinion within 30 - 40 minutes the whole team discusses the results .   Next , we introduce changes and additions to the diagram in the possible causes , factors and   consequences that were revealed in the process of collective discussion . As a result , we get a   comprehensive view of the problem , its causes and possible solutions . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This format of the work helps not only to understand the cause - effect relationships and influencing   factors in the analyzed problem , but also to expand the knowledge horizon and understanding of cross   functional processes among employees of related functions . So the marketing staff is beginning to   better understand the processes in the client service , and the developers of the product offerings are   getting closer to the sales staff 

 As a result , by reducing the scope of possible unreasonable and inefficient decisions , we get a list of   decisions prioritized on effectiveness . Further , using the Pareto principle , we draw up an action plan . 

 And it is also very important that the whole team participates in the formation of these decisions ,   strengthening the team 's cohesion , team spirit , and the horizons of employees in related areas of work .

"TOOL- MIND MAPPING 

 Tool selection & challenge     The tool which I started using frequently is the mind mapping tool . I use the tool before   beginning any college project , a piece of art and surprisingly to even type this assignment . I   have a mind map ready beside me which boosts up my ideas and does n’t let me miss any   points . By using mind maps , I know what my next steps are which is super useful and can   increase the efficiency of the task . I have used the tool recently for my mini project assigned by   my EVS professor . I used the tool to list out the contents of the project and made bullet points of   the context under every topic . This makes finalizing the drafts easier .       Application     I start the process with a sheet of paper and pencil . I think using a pencil is a good choice as it   helps in eliminating the unnecessary points and points which do n't fit well in later stages .   Now on the back side of the paper , I write down four questions- ​WHAT IS ? WHAT IF ? WHAT   WOWS ? WHAT WORKS?​ Now under the WHAT IS ? Block , i note down all the possible   contents ( Keeping the mini project as example ) .      Now comes the important step , for every content of WHAT IF ? I ask the next three questions   ( what if , what wows and what works ? ) so that i could eliminate a content if all four questions do   not satisfy and are n’t apt .     After filtering the WHAT IS block , i move to the WHAT IF block , here i club all contents and   check for various ​patterns . ​ This helps in categorizing the contents and I could create   situations and maybe find new ideas or have clarity in how the project is going to be labelled .    The what wows and what works block get filled eventually .     Now the whole idea behind this is to ​generate and experiment with ideas ​within the mind . This   is a whole imaginary process which I feel is great to experiment with .     With this , the main requirements are covered , i.e , Research , insights identification , establishing   a design , brainstorming ideas and developing concepts . All this is possible if we find the perfect   pattern .     Another habit I inculcated while using the mind mapping tool is that I never create multiple   drafts . One main draft with sub topics / sections is the best way to mind map . Having multiple   sheets will only lead to confusion . Keeping the mind map a little organized will help in better   understanding and finding the patterns between the contents is easy too . 

 Insights     What I learned while doing the project is that having a mind map in hand while creating a project   is really important as it saves a lot of time and helps in keeping contents organized .   It is also important to eliminate context which does n’t fit the situation rather than keeping it and   creating confusion later on .    Another important step is to note down every idea possible in the “ WHAT IS ? ” stage . Even the   smallest idea could create a perfect pattern and help in creating a project .     This is everything I could extract from the <NAME> - mapping tool and after knowing others views I   would improve my mind - mapping skills .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is a great tool that I use all the time , and I consider it necessary to Capture Attention , Build Trust , and Close a negotiation or obtain resources . I work with international teams , supporting and coordinating projects that focus on enhancing the experience of being a member of the company I work across international teams , helping reduce cultural shock , helping them feel part of a big company , and giving recognition and improve cross - collaboration .   I use storytelling to obtain approval from senior managers to run a project , get a perk for the employees or set process that may enhance cross - cultural collaboration , some times it gets a lot of time and efforts to obtain approval from senior managers since in company terms , could not be a top priority , this could be challenging .    I use stories from the employees or my personal experiences . I creatively use the information , knowing that senior management spends a lot of time in meetings , so I try to use interactive tools while sharing the story . 

 Application I have one story that came to my mind . Almost a year ago , the company had to merge international departments into one single Global department ; this incorporation was intended to equal opportunities , improve international user and employee experience , and make diversity a priority within the company . This goal sounds amazing and mindful ; however it brought a lot of challenges and bottlenecks . After a few months that the merger started , cultural shock arrived within the international members , with that lack of collaboration and unsuccessful processes dropping almost 20 % of the international employee satisfaction . I proposed launching an intercultural activity within all the teams , mapping all the cultures that integrated a team to help individuals and teams identify how cultures can impact their work , increase awareness , and be more effective at bringing differences and preventing invisible cultural barriers . To get an approval to launch this activity company - wide , I told a story about I migrated to <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , how I experience cultural shock .   My manager was from <ADDRESS> , we had different communication and leadership styles , at first I took everything personal ( I ignored the cultural differences )   one day she decide to not use my work , something that I took weekes in wraithe and instead she wrote her self something elese , thise make me feel so devastated , discouraged and upset . Some days passed , and I run a college and share with her my feelings , and she told me ¨think outside the box , she is a human , our past experiences shape the way we behave in our present ; one principal role working with international members is to help each other understand our cultural differences ” . 

 Insight & Approach After that I satared to learn more about my own culture and that is how I came with the idea of map the different cultures from a book I read “ The culture map ” Its only when you start to identify what makes your culture different from others that you can begin to open a dialoge of 

 sharing , learning and ultimately understanding- <NAME> <NAME> . After that , I had a deep , meaningful conversation with my manager bringing these differences , and after that , our communication and collaboration have to improve . I use my manager ’s experience to use storytelling and get the approval to launch this project . It was an open eye for many teams that had used the tool after we launched the activity .

"Challenge 

 Storytelling is an excellent tool that I always use . I work with people from different cultures . 

 I ’m an immigrant , I live at French but there are people who only speak English , Italian 

 Sometimes it is not so easy to achieve cultural integration , when people do not understand the   cultures of their neighbors . I spend time talking to people about the importance of integration , finding 

 ways to motivate them to learn a new language . 

 Selection 

 As an immigrant from <ADDRESS> , I have been able to learn french and how satisfying it has been for 

 me to learn about the history and culture of this country . Many people have shown interest in what I   have said and are interested in learning and sharing with people from other cultures , who speak   other languages . It has been very fruitful for me that people want to achieve cultural integration in this   country . 

 Application 

 I have a story about using storytelling . In discussion with the Integration Project , a community center .   I was trying to explain to them the benefits of creating practical courses in the languages spoken by   the various cultures in this city . I explained to them that many people are interested in cultural 

 integration and that for them as a center , it would be an excellent opportunity to achieve greater   integration . For many years , the Integration Project was focused on working with a limited   homogenous group , whose integration was very poor . I was explaining how they can achieve their 

 goals without creating heterogeneous groups with people from different cultures . 

 I help people of different nationalities regardless of their language . People seemed to be supportive   and to share what little they had . The idea is to serve as a bridge so that people can get to know 

 other cultures and at the same time understand and value the people around them without any kind   of prejudice . 

 Insight 

 That was a great thing . People started helping others to fix their houses . In the midst of the disaster , 

 strong relationships were created between neighbors that previously could not have been . I learned 

 that people are willing if they feel emotional to take the first step , 

 That is why it is necessary to put suitable resources at their disposal , such as starting to teach   courses in various languages for people who want to learn a new language . 

 <NAME> 

 I told this story to the Integration Project , because I realized the impact it created on the people there .   Of course , the staff of the Integration Project embraced the idea and immediately began creating the   courses to offer them to all those who perceive that cultural integration is important in our city . 

 I believe that telling a story is a good resource that can shed light on a project that can be of great   impact when seeking to achieve something good .

The challenge that   I am facing is how to train the students in applying this technique , and how to help the   students in arranging their ideas using key concepts , graphs and connections between   them to visualize their thinking . I am using this tool in my online Math classes among my   students . 

 How you Mind Mapping works ? 

 to have a closer look at how this tool is working , kindly see the link below : 

 <URL> 

 Application 

 Working in an online environment can be challenging to both teachers and students . This   is why I am planning to apply the following techniques to train my students to use the   <NAME> <NAME> tool : 

 1 . Understanding the meaning of the question , students will find the core words and known 

 conditions and implied conditions in the title as a branch of the graph , and simplify the   whole topic into a clear picture , provide a concise and clear environment . So , Construct a   Review Map 

 2 . Creating possible solving ideas map , students will formulate a scientific and reasonable 

 solution plan . So , construct a problem - solving ideas map . 

 3 . Building a reflection map that consists of reflecting both review map and solutions ’ ideas 

 map . Students will sum up the necessary knowledge points and ideas and strive to be able   infer the ability to solve problems . 

 Insight 

 Mind mapping tool helped students in clearing their thinking . It also helped in giving 

 them deeper understanding of the topic given . It promoted the way of solving question . Mind   map helps in brainstorming of ideas between students ; thus , it encourages collaborative work ,   secure communications and passing of ideas between participants . Students who used this tool   had better memory retention and became faster in taking notes . Because of brainstorming   sessions , creative ideas are presented , and accordingly cognitive skills of students are promoted . 

 Approach more effective 

 Visual representation of any mind map tool affects in attracting or not attracting students . Using   different colors to represent the map can help the student . To spur creative thinking , students are   advised to include images and symbols in their map . 

 To build a mind map , we need to perform the following steps :   Step 1 : Write the name of the topic ( central idea ) in the middle . Step 2 : From the central topic ,   draw the main branches that link the topics . On each main branch writing a word , the phrase   reflects an essential content of the topic . 

 Step 3 : From each main branch , draw additional branches ( sub - branch 1 ) to clarify that main   branch .   Step 4 , 5 Continue drawing branches level 2 , 3 etc .

"The Use of Storytelling in the Classroom 

 Challenge and Selection 

 As a high school teacher I use storytelling all the time .   I am currently teaching twelfth grade students 

 at a public high school in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> .   The island has not only suffered a major hurricane and an 

 earthquake in the last years but , is also undergoing economic struggles .   The majority of the students 

 are economically disadvantaged and see themselves as people who have very little power in helping 

 their communities better their problems .   As part of the course these students open up and tell me 

 about the social problems they are facing and worry about .   This is part of the sociological examination 

 that we have as part of the class .   It is through this activity that a deeper empathy is gained .   These 

 stories help them identify themselves as part of a greater society and to name the problems that they 

 would like to work with as part of the class .   These stories also help me identify what is going on in my 

 student ’s lives . 

 Application 

 Students tend to come into class talking about different themes .   Usually about things that are 

 happening to them .   They will even try to get an opinion out of you on what is happening .   Usually a 

 teacher will cut this conversation off so they can discuss the material at hand but , in my class , these 

 stories can help the discussion come to a point where they will tell you what worries them .   If you have a 

 class that is not very outgoing you can also give them a couple of themes to talk about .   It is important 

 for this storytelling to work that the students do not feel that you are judging them . 

 The stories will help the students identify with problems that have risen in the community .   It is through 

 this identification process that they will be more enthusiastic to work since they will see it as something 

 that belongs to them . 

 Insight and Approach 

 Storytelling has become a very useful form for the students to start their investigations since it helps 

 them gain empathy with different themes and make them their own .   The most important storytelling 

 lesson is that students empathize with the topic . It is not the same for them to have a theme tha that is 

 important to them as one that they themselves have identified . This pertinence creates a way for them 

 to feel masters of the situation . In this situation they also learn that they have the power to resolve their 

 own situations and build resilience in the student community . 

 After identifying the problems , they are divided into topics that they care about . Here they will begin to 

 discuss different ways in which they could solve them . The mind mapping tool could also very valuable 

 since it would the students organize their different ideas .   The outcome of the event should be one 

 where all the ideas of the participants can be merged into one .

"Challenge & selection     The first tool I used was the tool of <NAME> <NAME> ,   to   creat   new universiry program with   goverment funding for PhD students so that they were better prepared for their profesional   career . The idea was to really understand the pains that the students have in there current   programs , and waht are the key elements that they consider to be succesfull that the university   was not providing . I have used this technique often to really undertand the current situation ,   the opportunity or problem that i want to approach to then set de design criterias for the   solution     Application     I started the process by gathering all the information that i thought could be usefull for the   situation and then set some cuestions to do a ethnographic interview with some of the PHD   students . After i had donde the interviews and had some insight of what direction the new   peogram needed to go , i ask the students to imagine how would the program be if it could be   anithing that they wanted and aske them to draw is on a collage and explain to me what they   werw thinking . One of last steps was to put them all together and ask the wich of the elements   thata i had discovered werre more usefull to      Insight & Approach   What I have learned from   this exercise is that several groups is that sometimes is hard to   express in a graphic way what you are imaginig – especially when you are dealing with a   group of cientists . I think that really understanding the oppotunity and take the time to just   imagine if wvwrithing were possible what would someone do is critical and that sometimes   the data is not the most important element to consider ( cuantitativ data ) to provide the new   solution . I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and from there set   the design criterias to biuld a pilotbecause in these case the students erre more interested in   innovation subjects and relational skills with others than in the technical expertice to achive   a succesfull career

 Assignment - Design Thinking for Innovation 

 ( Visualization ) 

 Challenge :   My customer ( XYZ Electronics ) is into heavy electrical equipment such as transformers , electric boilers ,   etc . XYZ Electronics was running a large digital transformation programme with the objective to enhance   the selling experience for their Sales force . One of the needs was to enable the Sales force ( or XYZ account   managers ) to showcase the premium that XYZ Electronics charge to their customers for their products .   XYZ Electronics provide certain services that other vendors in the same industry does n’t offer and hence   they charge a premium on their products . But , it becomes difficult for the XYZ account managers to justify   this premium as they did not have any well - defined calculating or tracking mechanism . Their additional   services include : 

    Timely monitoring of equipment 

    <NAME> expert consulting 

    Rapid order delivery 

 Selection :   In order to deal with this situation , I choose “ Visualization ” design thinking tool . I got to know that <NAME>   account managers have tried to calculate and track the services delivered in PowerPoint presentations   and excel files in the past . Hence , I had some information that I can refer to and I can draw insights from   it and nourish / augment along with the account managers in defining the scope and key elements of the   solution .     Application :   Since I had an access to existing PowerPoint presentations and excel files that XYZ account managers had   created for showcasing value of premium services to their customers , I was able to learn and amalgamate   the information in those files into something that is more relevant , user friendly and customer facing . I   also conducted a few interviews with regional XYZ account managers to gather more information and   included in the visualizations that I was preparing . 

 Then , I organized workshops with a set of XYZ account managers ( 4 - 5 in a group ) . In these workshops I   displayed the sketches that I created from the existing material and the interviews on a wall . Then , I asked   the members to rate the visualizations based on two parameters : 

 1 . Rate ( rank ) the elements that the customers most value   2 . Signal the visualization that we can quantify ( Green ) or can not quantify ( Red ) 

 Later , in these workshops , I also co - created along with the account managers in defining the right   visualizations . I was amazed to understand that the account managers wanted something “ jazzy ” to   showcase to their customers and not just numbers or plain data . 

 2 | P a g e 

 Insights : 

 After having conducted multiple workshops along with different set of XYZ account managers , I could   draw following important insights : 

 1 . Displaying graphics helped the stakeholders relate faster to what they have been showcasing 

 earlier and what else they can do 

 2 . Co - creation in the workshop and modification of graphics ( based on live feedbacks ) was much 

 appreciated 

 3 . Account managers were looking for a tool that they can download on their smartphones and open 

 in front of their customers to drive sales conversations 

 4 . Account managers were clear as to what is important for them to include in the tool ( through 

 relative ranking exercise ) 

 5 . They were able to understand the missing variables and what they need to do in order to get the 

 missing pieces ( through Green - Red signaling exercise ) 

 Approach :   As I found out that the most important aspect of visualization is shared ideas and evolution on the basis   of them , next time I would use the visualization tool to start from scratch in the workshop itself and not   bring something from the existing material . I could discover that the XYZ account managers had a lot more   information with them based on their experience than I could find in the existing material . Hence , as a   starter I would prefer to get the insights from the stakeholders and then perhaps validate or augment   with what is available from the past .     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Process efficiency – Visualization 

 Business case and challenge : 

 Few months back I was aligned to a new project where I had to improve the efficiency of processes . This   was a unique case where I could n’t find any reference or used case . Initial analysis with data driven   approach was not helpful in understanding the real process challenges , there were lot of divergent   thoughts coming from the team while defining the business challenge and develop a vision with right   inputs and agreement with relevant stakeholders . That ’s when I thought of using Design Thinking   “ Visualization ” tool to identify the challenges faced in the processes and develop probable solutions   collaboratively including diverse group of stakeholders . Visualization is a design thinking technique to   address challenges through generating ideas and outline concept designs . I had prepared set of focused   questions that would allow diverse group of stakeholders to start collaborative discussion that would help   in defining project scope , boundaries , setting targets , areas of improvements . 

 Application : 

 I started with empathize phase the goal was to understand the stakeholders by gathering   information about the roles and activities performed by them in the processes . During this I used   focused group discussion and noted their observations . The information gathered helped me to   understand that existing current process maps and documentations were not providing cross   functional end to end process understanding . To ensure everyone ’s ideas are heard I had   compiled list of relevant stakeholders to be involved in decision- making process keeping in mind   this group interacts with internal / external suppliers and customers that enable the organization   to provide services . During the interview with group I used 5 Why s technique to understand   “ What , How , Why ” for every issue / challenge in the process . The purpose was to do detailed root   cause analysis and discover the actual problems in the process but not symptoms that looked   superficial challenges initially .     In second stage I created persona journey , this would help in understanding the needs of end   users as it encourages understanding end users ’ requirements empathetically , better   understanding of activities stakeholders are aiming to complete . To start with graphics of the   problem offered great starting point this served as outside the box thinking instead of narrating   the overarching process challenges in a usual manner that was monotonous . This approach   helped to narrow down actual challenges end users face and the opportunities of improvement   could be identified via this activity . This helped to understand what features are missing in   applications , how does it impact the overall process efficiency , what customization needs to be   done in the application to meet need of the end users . During this phase I had completed   brainstorming sessions with the users , developed hypothesized solutions and kept the sessions   open to capture every possible idea that would be solution to very process challenges / pain   points . In the end I prepared user story map that would allow to categorize the end users , map   the themes . For each of the personas defined the set of activities and tasks that should be   completed during the journey . By doing this it helped quickly test ideas and understand if it meets   the end user ’s requirement and how fast could this be deployed as it was one of the success   criteria . 

 Third phase was focused on ideation where the teams collaborated to ideate real solutions using   the above gathered information through sessions like sketching , prototyping , voting . As the   saying goes there is no “ Best or Wrong ideas ” . The viable solution for each problem was finalized   as per majority voting . These solutions were then discussed to be implemented with end users   to test in the process if it addressed the pain points discussed in the beginning of the project and   envision success in the end .     The last phase was Testing and implementation , I did n’t keep the Testing phase till very end , but   it was more of a constant loop of incorporating any feedback received from the user like in a   sprint mode Agile methodology . At the end of each accomplished step , we tried to get feedback   from users to move on to the next phase . After the prototyping was complete , it was time to test   with the larger audience and check with them how effectively the solutions met their   requirements , understand their perception . In the end all the gathered information and   experiences were translated and locked as final solutions . The activities were outlined within user   story maps to maintain evidences as artifacts of the personas . Story maps were created with the   thoughts identifying the activities carried out , steps required to complete , and list of tasks   associated with each other . 

 Insight and approach : 

 At the beginning when I had started Design Thinking Visualization to solve the process challenge   was apprehensive as the approach was different from traditional data driven analysis and   hypothesis building which I had been doing from long time . But at the end of this project I was   delighted to see the solutions were actually implemented that helped to improve the process   efficiency also this was highly appreciated by stakeholders and end users as they were part of the   entire exercise from beginning , this approach was perceived as inclusiveness and empathetic that   the steps we have laid out have helped to achieve something that would have been very hard   otherwise . From Project methodology perspective Visualization has also helped to clearly define   project scope , prevent scope creep . For business this has served as Real value add by right   selection of solutions to solve the process challenges and pain points 

 My biggest learning from this exercise is that solution identification can be applied to solve real   business problems in my case it was to improve the process efficiency within stipulated   timeframe , thinking empathetically from users ’ point of view and bringing people together .   Instead of using traditional problem - solving approach in sequential steps , this was focused on   iterations as per user feedbacks following Empathizing , Defining , <ADDRESS> , Testing and   <NAME> .

"My Insta Shops : Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection     The challenge is an startup , which arises from a business idea that it sought to   validate , so the first tool used was the Visualization tool , thus seeking to identify the   users and customers that it could involve within the initial study , identifying the   problem and making them known the possible solutions .    The study group was based on identifying people who made online purchases   through virtual stores on Instagram , understanding the difficulties they had in the   process , and making known a solution that would facilitate the search for stores and   reliable products for the purchase of their products and services , knowing the   intention to use this future platform and the degree of linkage with it .    Similarly , it sought to identify key elements that would provide greater added value ,   determining limits and scope of the project .      For these tools were used as surveys , and later a validation board , there were   different hypotheses that were subsequently validated and adjusted to give greater   validity to the business idea .       Application     Initially the process was started with a validation board , there were identified what   users and customers would be . For users a consumer hypothesis "" people who want   to buy in eShops "" was initially determined , along with a problem hypothesis "" they   find it difficult to find reliable products and stores on Instagram "" . Subsequently , a   validation method was determined , which was explored through surveys . With a   minimum acceptance criterion of 70 % .   Within the validation board , about 8 core assumptions were established , of which 4   were fully validated , 1 was invalidated , and 3 of them needed conceptual   restructuring .    The process was carried out in the same way as customers , Instagram stores   interested in being part of the platform .     Insight & Approach     At this stage of the project , the validation board allowed us to identify what the   survey should contain in order to obtain the information we needed in a clear and   concise way , interacting with what potential users would be , in this case "" online   buyers "" , identifying the needs and problems they present , the opportunities to solve   those problems , and gave us a better notion of what would be the user - oriented   solution and mainly the idea of business .      On the other hand , we had the challenge with what customers would be , the owners   of the virtual stores who wanted to sell their products to customers through the   platform . For this stage of the project , a small sample of shops was taken to do   qualitative interviews , from there we obtained some relevant information about 

 what customers would expect from such a platform , to then go on to perform a   smoke test .     For the use of the smoke test tool , we had to assemble a small illustrative video and   a landing page of what the project and platform would consist of , in this way we   would identify two things ; first , the intention and acceptance of the business idea by   Instagram stores ( customers ) , and second , a feedback on what they would expect   from the platform , the components they might consider missing and the degree of   commitment to it .     As the main solution hypothesis , an app / platform emerges that allows you to easily   find reliable products and stores within the Instagram environment , in order to   support small entrepreneurs and also be able to meet the consumption needs of   customers who have a greater taste to make their purchases in a virtual way .

"Challenge 

 I work in the design industry . I deal with big organizations and/or creative agencies . The   company I work for is a service provider and helps clients express and translate their   brand values through typographic means such as custom font solutions . It is a highly   specialized niche service which needs a lot of explanation at the top and at the bottom of   a sales funnel : at the top because it is a quite pricy service and not all stakeholders   involved are aware of the necessity and power of custom typefaces in branding and at the   bottom because people involved in later stages of a ( re)design project are even less   familiar with branding / marketing topics , are on the execution side of things and try to   sustain the status quo against organizational pressure from the top ranks . Therefore I ’m   usually facing a multitude of challenges which includes a diverse group of stakeholders   and where a substantial part is ﬁnding common ground among decision makers and   executers throughout the entire process : from acquisition , to education , ideation ,   execution , delivery and implementation . The preferred method to achieve my goals is to   utilize the Design Thinking tool of <NAME> .

Every great brand has a story and that story connects to the emotions , the characters ,   the values of the people that , that live that product every day . <NAME> 's always been a   part of business . ” – – Week 2 , <NAME> <NAME> 

 I could n’t agree more with the quote above . I ’m utilizing Storytelling because stories are   primal , fundamentally human and highly eﬀective vehicles to transcend profession , class ,   gender , age or any kind of social or geographical dialectics . The collective reception and   co - creation of stories unites stakeholders across organizational silos and helps to work   towards a common goal . 

 Application 

 In my latest project I had the opportunity to participate in a redesign of a major European   clothing retailer . My job was to custom ﬁt a typeface towards the needs of the clients –   both the responsible design agency and the retailer himself . I used to make use of   storytelling in previous projects but this time I tried to emphasize this design tool even   more . One of the reasons to do so was the surprisingly profound involvement of the   retailer which made me to multiply my eﬀorts in order to convince three parties at a time –   the retailer , the design agency and my design director . 

 I ﬁnd that one of the most overlooked tasks of a brand consultant or any kind of brand   service provider is simply listening to the client . Though it sounds so easy it is a diﬃcult   task which demands quite some grit . I experienced client meetings where the participants   were bewildered about this rather passive approach during the ﬁrst meeting . In order to   create a common story one has to listen what the other has to say . In my professional   environment it is usually the brand that speaks – or the brand manager on its behalf . My   job is quite simple : to help to articulate the essence of the brand with abstract means   such as a typeface . 

 In order to do so I carry out workshops with the client side to isolate certain brand values   that are important to emphasize and translate into a set of letters . If a brand is elegant 

 and feminine one would play with high - contrast serif typefaces and rather narrow   proportions . The opposite applies for rugged masculine brands . They ask for low- contrast , almost brutalist shapes . Of course this is just a brief and stratospheric view   since one can express certain characteristics through countless measures in a typefaces   such as : contrast , curve speed , weight , <ADDRESS> , horizontal proportions , vertical proportions ,   and many more . 

 In this particular case I used storytelling elements to connect the contemporary means of   crafting garment and applied the processes metaphorically to a typeface . Repetition ,   uniformity , scale , resolution , details , materiality are factors that are relevant and were put   into consideration . The research and ideation part was presented as a in - person   presentation including details of the typeface contrasting details of modern day garment   and its production machinery . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 To convey an emotional set of brand values or a brand story into abstract geometrical   shapes is an intimidating endeavor . I ’m intrigued though that through storytelling these   abstract shapes becomes relatable . We are all wired in a similar way . The hardest part is   not really the translation for me but the communication and presentation of my work .   Especially the educational part plays more and more a substantial part in my work since I   realize that the more I become a professional the bigger the gap of knowledge gets   between me and the client . Focusing more on visual sensitization through workshops ,   presentations and videos is something I spire to do for my next client .

 Story Telling 

 Challenge and Selection :     The tool I chose was storytelling , I believe it is a great way to inspire and set apart our 

 differences and bring empathy to those who are struggling . Storytelling has helped me realize   that others go through similar struggles and sometimes worse than my own , which helps put my   problems in perspective . I also enjoy storytelling to uplift others and give them a new standpoint   from my eyes . I use this approach in many different settings , but mainly in work situations . In   these work situations , I have worked with many different people from all walks of life . Because   of this , it was important to utilize the right story at the right time to convey a message . In every   job I have held , there have been many stories told and many that are forgotten . Many of us have   now begun to understand the struggles of our coworkers and realize the similarities many of us   have which helped us come together as a team . These stories ranged from hilarious , depressing ,   to inspiring . Storytelling helps energize my workplace and bring a more open environment . It   was a great way to “ walk a mile in their shoes ” as the saying goes . Immersive storytelling can   put you in a different world and can be a great learning experience . Everyone has their own   stories of battles and triumphs they have had in their life ; it is about finding the right story to tell   at the right time to inspire . 

 Application :     Recently , at my current position at the campus bookstore , I had a coworker confide in 

 me . She was very stressed about her future as a teacher and overwhelmed by her current life   situation . She just recently had a breakup and was noticeably down at work . This has not only   affected her mental health but also her overall performance on the job . She has shown up late   almost every day the past few weeks . In addition to the relationship issues , she has worries if she   has the skills and abilities for her future career . This was an opportune time for me to implement   storytelling . In this situation , I used storytelling to help her understand that she can get through   these difficult situations and that I empathize with her because I have been in her situation . I had   also gone through a terrible breakup while in college , and it destroyed my mental health as well   as my performance at not only work , and school , but also daily life . During this time in my life , I   could not even manage to get out of bed those first few days . I struggled to take care of myself   and get food . I lost 10 pounds in one week . I did not want to do anything and wanted to be left   alone . I knew this was a toxic cycle that I needed to stop . I ’m afraid I ’m seeing some of the same   issues when I talk to her . I gave her some advice on how I got out of this funk , I told her that   would finally help me by surrounding myself with others and just accepting the reality of the 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 situation . Once I accepted the reality and realized I did not have to do this alone , it got better . I   started to go out with friends ; I focused on learning who I really was . I realized that I was 20   years old and that I had so much life ahead of me . I told her that she is young just like I was and   that if he were the right one it would have worked out . I told her it is okay to feel sad but to also   focus on all the new free time and opportunities now available to her . In my situation , it got   better with time and I expressed how each day that passes is a day you are farther away from that   moment of hurt . I reminded her how young she is and how the right one will surely come .   College is supposed to be one of the best times of your life , and I believe you should enjoy them   with friends and not spend that time looking for a wife / husband . She really appreciated the   advice and she expressed how she is going to try to accept the situation . My coworker had also   had anxiety about her future , specifically , her career . She is planning on being an elementary   school teacher but does not know if she has it in her to be a good teacher . I know how this feels   firsthand as I was a Preschool and kindergarten teacher in <ADDRESS> . Shortly after my breakup , I   went to <ADDRESS> to teach English without a degree and had no education or experience regarding   teaching . I was a business student , so I truly felt like I was going in blind . I had never lived in the   country and did not know any Korean . However , despite all this , I ended up doing very well as a   teacher and was voted the best teacher in the center by the students . I told her that she can do   anything she sets her mind to . If I can do it , then I know for a fact that she can do it . I reminded   my coworker of her work ethic and her ability to adapt . I think storytelling in this situation was   very beneficial to her because she can visualize herself when she hears that someone who she   knows with similar struggles has achieved the goals she is pursuing . Better days are ahead for   her and I wanted to make sure she knew that . She was appreciative of the advice and has made   me optimistic of my storytelling abilities . 

 Insight & Approach :       What I learned from this experience is all someone needs sometimes is hope . 

 Many of us get down especially in the hard times we are currently in . Hearing uplifting stories   that show that you can overcome your struggles can make a huge difference . I could see in my   coworker ’s overall body language that she had been going through some difficult times .   However , I was raised to not get into people ’s business , so I waited until I was approached by   her . She approached me on the verge of tears and told me about her struggles . As someone who   had been through a bad breakup , I immediately could empathize . I knew storytelling could be a   powerful tool in this situation , I just had to make sure I applied it right . 

 After taking this course , I realized that I could have approached her myself . As a fellow 

 team member , I should care about their welfare and be willing to put forth some effort to help . I   have always enjoyed storytelling but lacked some of the necessary skills to make the story useful   and beneficial to those I told the story . Design thinking helped me in helping my coworker   overcome a struggle . I see this helping me in a big way as I aspire to be in a managerial role at a   company someday . This class will help me learn how to use my storytelling and resources to   help others understand their potential . Design thinking has helped me realize that storytelling is   essential to becoming a good leader and can be useful in all aspects of life .

"Tool Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I am a student enrolled in a marketing and entrepreneurship course in which I have a final 

 project that asks me to create a business idea that is sustainable and generates a great value   impact on society . Since the main objective of the project is to create something that actually   helps society , two of the steps of design thinking must comply , empathize with the people and   define the true problem . In order to do so , me and my team are applying the tool of storytelling .   It is very common that people wo n’t share to you as a researcher their main life problems or   issues , and in the strange case that some of them actually start talking about them , they wo n’t get   too deep into their problems unless you motivate them to do so , this is where the tool of   storytelling comes in pretty useful . If you empathize with a person by sharing some personal   story about some specific aspect then it is way more plausible that the client , which is hearing to   that story can remember some of his own experience and understand what type of information   you are looking for , after that another challenge is presented , which is focusing on their feedback   and understand their story . 

 Application 

 My final project team decided to work with the topic of pollution and the major problems 

 and causes that are presented with the pollution of the planet , more specifically we wanted to do   something related to recycling in <ADDRESS> , which is currently an underdeveloped field in the   country . So we wanted to find out valuable information regarding the major problems of the   recycling process , we wanted to know what was the point of view of the common Mexican   towards recycling and what were their main problems while recycling or trying to recycle . 

 In order to get this type of information we started to think about a story , so we could use 

 it as part of the design thinking tool and achieve our research goals . I have a personal story   regarding this subject , in which I try to explain the benefits of recycling and how is it being   solved in first world countries in which I have lived in , like <ADDRESS> and <ADDRESS> , I was   constantly trying to connect with the person with whom I was talking by calling out some of my   personal problems towards recycling in <ADDRESS> , like not knowing where to take my plastic   bottles to . I also understand and explained to them that all the culture of recycling depends also   on other customs like how much products do you actually buy , because if you buy a lot of stuff   then you will be producing a lot of garbage , but if you do n’t then you wo n’t have a lot of things   to recycle , but it is even better to do so , because you are actually reducing instead of recycling . 

 Some of the people to whom I talked to , started explaining me that even if they started 

 separating their trash in categories , one of the main problems is that the whole system of trash   recollection would not make it useful , because they mix all the trash categories and then they go   and throw them into one place . They also tried to explain to me that another problem that they   face is that there are no places to do recycling nearby , and if they want to recycle a couple of   plastic bottles they would need to drive 10 minutes in order to get there , which would be even   worse for the environment . 

 Insight & Approach 

 We started to get to know the main problems of recycling in the community , not only the 

 ones that we were struggling with , but there were many other that we as a team did n’t think   about before . One of the most important insights that we got from many people was that they   did n’t see any benefit of trying to dealing with all the trash separation in their homes , because   they knew that the trash recollection system would not be handling the garbage properly ,   therefore they would n’t be able to contribute to some change . 

 We started telling them another story about how they started in other countries , and we 

 explained that in order to change something , small steps need to be taken . Of course , we tried to   emphasize that there will not be a major change in one week or two , but we could start by doing   something . We started to pitch our business idea with the help of this story , having an app that   helps you with your garbage categorization and that notifies the trash collectors if you have a lot   of plastic , or metals , or organic garbage . In that way they could start handling the waste in a   more appropriate way . 

 At the end , most of the people felt convinced that they could do something that helps the 

 environment without having to work that much . Personally , I felt very good because I was able   of empathizing with the people and to define the main problems that they have and with that   information I was able to generate new ideas of possible solutions with my team .

"Example Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 A mind map is a way to diagram your thoughts and explore a career topic . It ’s a   simple process for examining pros and cons and for linking relevant elements . This   flexible tool will help you make better decisions along your career path . 

 Some possible mind map styles : 

 1 . Put yourself in the center and list relevant activities , experiences , concerns or   questions .   2 . Start with a specific career field that interests you and try it out – consider all the   avenues in that field and any benefits , concerns or questions .   3 . Map out a number of career fields you are considering and include your thoughts   about each field . 

 Samples : 

 Mind mapping is a way of taking notes , capturing ideas , exploring concepts and   breaking down information into a more readily understood format . It ’s a place where   visual representations and written representations of things merge to create   something that is more natural to the mind ; it works with and represents the way we   think , where as paragraph - based text is not representative of the thought process at   all . 

 There are a million and one uses for mind mapping . You can use it to study for a big   exam . You can use it brainstorm new article ideas , or flesh out what needs to be   covered in the business plan for a new venture . You can organize a big move of   house ; heck , I ’ve seen people use the mind map format for their daily to - do lists   ( each to their own , eh ? ) . 

 Applications 

 Freemind is one of the most popular free mind mapping applications out there , and   that ’s mainly because it ’s in <NAME> and thus cross - platform ( and because it ’s a great   app , of course ) . This software implements some of the major features that digital task   lists have over paper task lists : retractable and expandable branches and   hyperlinking between different branches make it easier to organize and easier to   connect ideas . 

 bubble.us is a free web - based mind mapping application . You can sign up for an   account in order to save your mind maps , but better still , they do n’t force you to get   an account to start creating . The interface could use some work to make it a truly   usable application . 

 Insight and approach 

 There are huge advantages to creating your mind maps with paper and pen . In fact ,   though I ’ve tried many different mind mapping programs over the years , pen and   paper remains my favourite way of creating them . Some would say that it is a part of   the process . That said , there are distinct advantages in using software and sometimes   you need to decide what the best tool for the job is on a case by case basis . For when   that time comes , here are 11 free mind mapping applications and web services .

"I Just Wanna Pass 

 Challenge & Selection     The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding   of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define   possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our customers , who are government   agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their   services to their customer , which may be <ADDRESS> citizens , businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the   technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for   discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining   the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying   pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions .     Application     I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or   other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three   of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative .     If appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the concept to “ front - stage / back - stage ” from previous   research , and discussed in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” . The front - stage / back - stage   approach helps to reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers   with whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide   the service . The template I often start with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value   Chain Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations , such as Congress , GAO ,   labor unions , advocacy groups , and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization   operates . The straw man graphic is simple , using simple shapes and icons available in <NAME> or on the   Internet . If the front - stage / back - stage view does n’t work , then I will create a different type of visual ,   either based on a high - level process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders , or another format .     For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a   different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man   graphic that they can write on directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I give them two - three   questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What would you   change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What key insights   do you have about the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I give them   approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have each group   report out on their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on their poster . As   each group reports out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and then additional   insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic . After the session , I   digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared and new insights from   the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed   changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach     What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic –   especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the   shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them   to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they   could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump   starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are   missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of   taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps   them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide   the values for the variables .     Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would   use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised   graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the   remainder of their work .

"Storytelling     Challenge   I am currently working as a design consultant in an Indian IT services organization . As part of   the presales / bidding team pitching for design , development , testing services for different   customers around the globe , we are faced with a complex problem as the customer   audience varies from marketing , technology , sales , etc .     Sometimes the questions miss out on the front of the experience , although found to be an   essential component of the outcome 's success , based on our initial research . A standard   method of starting the discussion is needed in order to provide the client with a vision to   begin the discussion and then expand it into the different domains .     Once we replied to a proposal for a global consumer goods corporation , an opportunity was   raised , the request was to unify the online presence of their laundry services , currently in   the form of three different websites for their dry cleaning , self - service locker and campus   laundry services , also present was a mobile application limited to monitoring the clothes .   The basic need was to switch to an online presence that was cohesive . The query was   specific , to create one of the three websites .     Selection   The main concern was that the customer was not aware of the difficulty of establishing a   unifying presence from currently 3 different sites with different users , their journeys and   expectations . Simple scope listed the development of the web - based site and the extension   of services to their current mobile application . The requirement did not meet the current   mobile dependency trends and all the target users of the clients needed a seamless   experience . This aspect had to be effectively communicated to the customer .     I decided to use storytelling as a tool to create the right impact to communicate what our   vision was for the unified portal of the brands . Storytelling would also help explain to the   client how to look at the development of the marketplace for their clients ( such as offering   later cross - selling and upselling opportunities ) , which seemed to have been ignored in their   need . Last but not least , since the result was to be a B2C ( Business to Customer ) experience ,   the need was for a deeper extension of the product story to make the connection to their   customers through empathy . Telling stories would be an appropriate tool for the above .     Application   I wanted the story to contribute from the client 's side to the reviewers ( audience ) . So the   story line I created was from a campus student 's point of view , not only because the student   was also a recipient of the services of clients , but also because they will have the connection   for them based on their similar past experience ( nearly all of them must have been a   student at some point in time ) .     Another justification to choose the student on campus was that he / she might be more   willing to make more transparent use of other services offered by the company . A woman   named <NAME> has been selected as the story 's main character where she enters as a college   freshman . For her journey to college , the concept was also developed . <NAME> 's life in a day 

 was the main storyline that focused on the pain points , for example : time juggling between   classes , preparation required before laundry , stress she 's going through thinking about the   same , etc . It illustrated the main challenges . The story was told using storyboarding and   imagination and the video conference was used to render the presentation .     The main issues were highlighted after the story telling which were : availability of   convenience - based laundry options , preparation assistance needed , laundry cycle   scheduling , etc . A description of the solution was also portrayed in a story form as the   happy state . The argument was also posed that in the future the consumer will become a   different client of the segment and as the connection is made he / she could become loyal   to the brand and continue the journey through other services . There has also been a strong   business case of upsell / cross sale throughout the plot . I was able to highlight a major   strategic turning point that the customer wanted in terms of strategy , which was to focus on   the mobile presence approach rather than the new web - based application .     So the plot was constructed from a present - day concept to a future scenario and steps of   how to achieve that state .     Insight   The presentation was well received by the consumer , they agreed with most of the   suggested changes to the range . Few of which they stated was reserved for the future scope   of work that could not be implemented . Overall , using story telling to drive forward our   strategic vision and win the project was a fair and acceptable case .     Storytelling as a method is very powerful but has its limitations . It is very effective in cases   where the story of the brand needs to be enhanced , created or re - looked . The method of   telling the story also works in cases where the strategic changes are to be suggested . But it 's   hard to use storytelling to build use cases or business cases when the context of something   is already well - defined or solution clarity is very current , examples of which would be B2B   ( business to business applications ) .     Approach   The approach I adopted for the above scenario was ideal and worked perfectly , but as I face   different customers with different needs this method may not produce the same results as   others .     As mentioned above , telling stories would be helpful in cases where the brand value and   user - centric layout play a major role , but many times I or we face customers from the B2B   sector where the queries are not so focused towards the above points . I 'd try to use a   storytelling mix with the streamlined process / service flow approaches in that case .

"Teaching medical subject and making the students understand it ’s quite challenging . 

 Though the students were aware of the subjects from schooling they find difficult to   remember or tend confuse in the similar topics such as the functions of sympathetic and   parasympathetic systems in the neuroanatomy . When I ask the students what ’s the function of   sympathetic nervous system few were correct , few were wrong and majority of them are not   sure . 

 So I got an idea how to make them certain about the functions of sympathetic and 

 parasympathetic nervous system . During my next class I gave them white paper and told   them you have surprise test today and the marks you obtain from this test will be added to   your internal marks which gave them a panic and after few minutes I explained them "" this is   how sympathetic nervous system will work and when I say no test , you feel relaxed there   comes the action of parasympathetic system "" . Literally I could see that they understood   clearly , few started clapping out of excitement .

"Reflection : Mind Mapping 

 Challenge   I work for a small company that ’s looking to launch a new product / service to really make a   difference . The goal is to keep more teens and young adults informed on day to day news ,   events , movements and changes happening in the world . This is crucial as these youngsters   are the future and their decisions and thoughts matter immensely . They need to be more   involved and aware to make the right decisions and sustain future generations . 

 Selection   I decided that mind mapping would be a great tool to help my co - workers and I explore our   ideas and come up with solutions to this problem . A mind map is a diagram used to visually   organise information . It shows the relationship amongst different pieces of the whole .   Individual mind maps are converted by accommodation . This could help organise the   group ’s ideas in a manner that best represents each persons views and shows how they ’re   linked and to what . 

 Application   The process begins by exploring the current situation , or ‘ what is ' . We conduct extensive   research on how much our target audience knows about what is going on in the world right   now and how they came to know of it . We figure out what interests them and what drives   them to research different topics . Most importantly , we separate them into age categories   ranging from 13 to 25 and speak with these different groups personally and really engage   with them and figure out what could help each group more . 

 This is followed by sharing the data we ’ve obtained with everyone involved and each of us   drawing a mind map of our proposed solutions or what we think would work best . Related   ideas are connected with simple lines and everything flows logically . For example someone   might say 13 to 15 year olds are more visually inclined and often on their phones . This   implies their source would have to include graphics and big letters and be digital and hassle   free . They might propose an app or a website without necessarily requiring log in as that   saves time . 

 These individual mind maps are then shared with the group to get an idea of how each   individual is thinking . From this , co creation happens . People with similar ( not same ) ideas   can try and make a single mind map to incorporate their thoughts and differences best . This   process repeats till we have one final mind map which is a best fit of every individuals   thoughts and ideas . The ideas which do n’t make it to the final mind map are saved for later   trials . 

 Insight   From using the tool of mind mapping , everyone ’s thoughts became clearer . We were able to   make sense of why a person thought something was fitting and were also able to 

 accommodate differences . The final mind map helped us bring our project to life including   bits of everyone ’s ideas based off the initial research . There were a lot of new approaches   which resulted from everyone making their individual mind maps first . For example , instead   of just an app , having uniquely chosen notifications alone ( perhaps from a website without   needing too much information ) would be a good idea based on the target group ’s interests . 

 <NAME>   Mind mapping seemed to be the perfect tool in our case and helped us come up with several   smart solutions to implement . It satisfied our requirements .    Another way to approach the problem would be to use visualisation to look at our target   group as different personalities and use that as the basis of finding our solutions   individually . Different people might visualise different personalities and hence different   solutions from which our final personalities arise , similar to the example in week 3 . 

 In our next step we would include the tool learning launch to see how our product , which is   the result of our final mind map , performs . We would try it out on our sample groups and   see the responses and engagement and compare it to previously collected data . If there is an   improvement , we ’re ready to officially release the product . Else , we return to the mind   mapping stage and try out other ideas and iterate till the goal is reached .

 Once a man was in need of parking space near a   business complex where he was having a   very important meeting regarding his business and he was late due to traffic and other stuff but fortunatly he has registered him self on the app and has booked a parking slot for him . 

 Joy is a regular user of the application so he knows how to deal with is so by taking that   advantage he is using it an way in which he receive the money when he empty the parking   space . So he is earning a few amount of money which he can use that latter . 

 Once a man had booked a parking space for 3 hrs . And after that he will be emptying that   space but due to some reason he has not vecant that space , so the person who has pre   booked that space has to find other space . 

 once someone has booked a parking space for a particular parking space but some how he was   not able to reach over that place .As he has prebooked that space so no one can occupy that   for that time slot . so someone who is in need of that has to park else ware as that space   available bit pre booked for someone .

"Reflection on Visualization Tool 

 Challenge 

 Visualization is a powerful tool that helps integrate different views and trains of thought . I use it to   illustrate and idea or process , which comes in handy since I have always worked with people from different   areas and backgrounds . I work as Customer Marketing Coordinator for a multi - national massive   consumption Company . I ’ve been in this role for a year and a half , and I previously worked as CPFR   ( Collaborative Planning , Forecasting and Replenishment ) Analyst for two years . Both my jobs have   required the capability to add value through collaboration between different areas . For example , as CPFR   I had to collaborate with the Sales Department , and be part of the Supply Chain Team . Now , I work with   Marketing , Sales , Supply Chain , Planning and Category Management areas . At the beginning of this year ,   our Company was struggling with Market Research data that showed we kept losing Distribution points   versus our competitors . This meant we were selling our products in less stores that we should . The typical   approach for this issue was to “ put the blame ” on the Key Account Manager , who would “ put the blame ”   on Marketing , and we would be stuck in a vicious circle and find no solutions . So I was asked to lead a   Workstream to improve our <NAME> , and therefore , our sales . 

 Selection 

 Since this was a complex task , I realized I had to create a multi - functional team to successfully map the   problem and to get commitments from all parties towards finding a solution . To understand the problem   from all its angles , I chose to use Visualization tool , which consists of using drawings , maps , photos ,   <ADDRESS> and other visual components that enable “ Visual Thinking ” – as Designer <NAME> <NAME> explains   in this course , Visualization is basically using a part of our brain different than logic , which we use most of   the time . In this way , by directing everyone ’s attention towards the same model of the problem , we would   all be speaking the same language regardless of our background and areas of expertise . 

 Application 

 We held a workshop with people from different areas of the Company that were somehow related to the   issue of “ stores without sales ” . This meant we had people from Marketing , Category Management , Fields   Sales , Key Account Manager ( KAM ) , Customer Marketing ( me ) , Demand Planning and Supply Chain ( CPFR ) .   At first , everyone thought that the only reasons why we had stores without sales were the most obvious   ones ( which we will call “ Lame Ducks ” ): our price was n’t competitive , our promotions were not attractive ,   our portfolio was n’t appealing , and our service level to our customers was not on target , among others .   However , once we started to integrate everyone ’s point of view , and we started “ drawing ” different   scenarios through a diagram ( your typical arrow – concept – arrow , nothing fancier ) , we realized that the   problem could have many other causes , most of them driven by the fact that there was no stock of our   products in store ( hence , the “ no - sales ” part ) . 

 We identified that a store could either have sales , or have no sales . For stores with no sales , if there was   no stock , this could be driven by forecasting issues of Phantom Inventory ( theoretic stock but no physical   stock ) . If there was stock in the store , there were two possible causes for not having sales : the wrong   execution or the ones we referred to before as “ Lame Ducks ” . This meant we were only looking at 1 of 4   possibilities at the beginning of the session . Once we were able to map this , we associated responsible   areas for each case , which allowed us to search for solutions through our different roles , rather than   blaming each other . 

 Insight 

 Now , with all this eye - opening information , we were able to understand with a more complete   approach not just this issue , but many other problems that other areas go through , and we realized that   through visual thinking these “ big complex problems ” could be split into “ smaller simpler problems ” ,   and through collaboration we could get better more efficient solutions that add more value to the   business . This exercise helped me understand better the “ Human ” part of the Design Thinking process .   Sometimes when we use tools like <NAME> , we are able to empathize with others , and join forces   into finding efficient win - win solutions for all stakeholders . 

 Approach 

 In this case , we were able to take a step back and not just be focused in one possible cause for the   problem , but deep dive into other possible causes , and find suitable solutions . There was no blame   involved , but collaboration , empathy and creativity . We still have a lot of work ahead of us , but I am   confident that by identifying the root causes of the stores with no sales , we will be able to solve these   issues through concrete and tailor - made solutions . 

 I look forward for more challenges like this one , where we can add value through collaboration ! 

 The picture above illustrates the Visualization Tool being used to map the possible causes for stores with   no sales , and the responsible areas in each case .

"Challenge 

 During my graduation years , I was a part of a social service unit named National Service Scheme   ( NSS ) unit . It was a 2 - year programme and during the second year , I was one of the leaders of our   college 's NSS unit . We were to plan an orientation event for the new volunteers who were joining   the unit . This is where we came across a challenge as to how to inspire the new volunteers to give   their best and not just do this for improving their resume ( plus there were brownie points as well in   the academics if you completed the two years of the NSS programme ) . 

 Selection 

 All the leaders ( 5 of us ) were brainstorming to strike a common ground as to what approach must be   used to instil the empathy and determination , which was required to actively participate in the   activities of NSS , in the new volunteers . I came up with an idea of using story - telling technique , i.e.   to try to connect with the audience , a.k.a the new volunteers , all the leaders decided to share one   story each that portrayed their past experiences so that the new volunteers could connect to the   values of the programme . 

 We , in some sense , had used this precious tool of Design Thinking ( unknowingly ) at the time . 

 Application 

 On the day of the orientation event , I shared one of my experiences of my first year with the NSS   unit . 

 Experience : I had volunteered to participate in the pulse polio drive that was going across <ADDRESS>   ( my college 's location ) and I was posted in a small locality where not many people were aware about   the need for polio vaccines for their children . We started by first setting up the booth and then some   of our team members ( I was one of them ) went to each and every house in the locality to persuade   them to vaccinate their children . I remember there was one family that was quite adamant on not   inoculating their child but we made them understand the need for the vaccines and also showed   them an awareness video and somehow , we were successful in getting their child vaccinated . The   incident still gives me a lot of happined . 

 The other leaders also shared their stories with the new volunteers during the event . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 I could not believe that our approach had worked so well with the new volunteers . I remember   many of the volunteers contacted us personally as well as over the phone ( via texts , calls ) that they   actually wanted to bring change in the society and that they will devote their time to NSS unit   enthusiastically . 

 In the hindsight , when I think about that meeting of us - leaders , I am able to connect to the content   of this course . Using the story - telling approach in our case enlightened the new volunteers to put in   efforts to add value to the NSS unit . 

 Drawing upon the course 's teachings , I can say that a visualisation approach will have also reaped   similar results . We could have mapped the past year 's journey of the NSS unit and could have   showed them the impact we made in the society .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge and Selection of the tool     The tool I will consider for Design Thinking is Storytelling . The field is Education and people involved are   K-12 teachers mainly . Storytelling may provide teachers the ability to develop ideas , to share ideas , speak   about a specific situation which can be similar to others and to share an understanding of common   situation that affect most of the time students , teachers ’ community and the whole School . I consider   Storytelling to be the first tool to be applied with teachers , because it gives them a voice .      The challenge is K12 teacher ’s community necessity to add value to the development and adaptation of   curriculum through design . It is well known in education the necessity of teachers ’ professional   development . In terms of curriculum design storytelling plays an important role to add value to teachers ’   ideas through sharing situations for transformation in educational settings . Most of the development in   curriculum faces for innovation through the added value given by information and communication   technology ( ICT ) which most of the time teachers how to acknowledge alone in their own classroom   settings . When communicating strategies and ideas by storytelling they can be closer to everyone   expectations and frustrations adding value to their own stories . The closer you get to customers ’ lives , to   their problems and their frustrations , the better you will be at creating new value for them ( 15:54 Video   3 Week 2 )     Application      The problem can be approached by reuniting the group of teachers who are in curriculum design and   innovation . First they are presented with a narrative of a curriculum design innovation . For this step , they   are going to listen to different cases were curriculum design has been used . To develop the story , I will   tell them about a teaching innovation case at the classroom level . For this , I will use existing designs from   a share community of teachers who has previously design using different validated theories and concepts   drawn from educational design . In this regard , authors like Laurillard ( 2012 ) and Mor(2012 ) have done a   wide application on curriculum innovation .    For educational purposes when designing for learning the added value is always put on students ’ learning .   How do leaners learn best ? This is by adding value through the use of digital technologies for education ,   by applying specific methodologies related with learning theories that had been proved in specific   subjects .   Changing learning activities , time , learning space , situations , interaction among teacher- student - content and learning environment .   So the stories can be introduced narrated by me as a   presenter , also included in video presentations by teachers who have gone through the same task .     For the activity . We will give room to form groups of 5 participants which will be working on designing for   a shared educational problem or opportunity by narrating the story with key aspects borrowed from   Laurillards ’ work , such as : Tittle of the experience , source , description , learning topics , learning outcomes ,   rationale , duration , learners ’ characteristics , context , group size , resources and tools , description of   learning cycles or interaction among teacher , student , content - learning environment .     In this sense , they will use storytelling to communicate this educational problem / opportunity , the current   situation that they need to improve . Based on this work , I will give them 3 questions to answer , such us :   1 ) How the educational technology is adding value to students ( motivation , use of time , deliveries ,   knowledge construction ) 2 ) How they are going to measure or identify this added value ?   3 ) How is the   interaction at play in this learning situation ? And What can be changed to be improved ? 

 Participants share among the group their work and answer those 3 questions . As each group reports out ,   feedback given by other groups will be recorded to gain insights on each ideation . Then each storytelling   will be recorded and then each group will modify the story according with the best inputs from peers   followed by my guidance on changed agreed on the group .     Insight and approach     The most interesting part of this exercise though storytelling is teachers able to live their experiences as   it happens in real life in all the adjectives and emotions that happen in practice . The fact that peers   collaborate to make others work better , gives them a feeling of partnership and support , of community .   In education , this work has been proven by the fact that teachers do n’t have to invent the wheel every   time they are planning teaching . Instead , they can work with others teaching designs and add value to   them according to the context and learners ’ characteristics , as well , other variables .      Alternative Approach     I would make this design thinking application better by mixing visualization tool with storytelling .

"Challenge : 

 I am an IT analyst working for the development of a large sports goods manufacturing   organization ’s Product Planning tool . The Product Planning tool consists of 250 + attributes to be   filled during the creation process of the product . The attributes are dependent on each other with   each having its own independent validations . The products that gets created is of massive scale   and roughly 8000 products get planned per season by 200 creators . Filling up 250 + attributes per   product is an extremely tedious task . The challenge was to place the 250 + attributes in a   meaningful way in the creation template which would avoid the inefficiencies and delays in the   product creation process . Yet another challenge was to understand the usage of the attributes by   the creators , which would help us in grouping the attributes . 

 Selection : 

 We from the IT team , thought through the design thinking tools and decided to go ahead with   Visualization via card sorting . The research technique that we used was Card sorting exercise , which   helped us in understanding the creators ’ constructs in placing the 250 + attributes in logical groups .   Most importantly , card sorting exercise gave us insights on how the creators perceive the domain   of each of the attributes in their daily work . 

 Application : 

 Since the card sorting exercise was with limited set of users and could not be done with all 200   creators , we built the logical grouping of attributes iteratively , consuming the feedback received   by all the users later from business operations . For our first go - live with the new form of creation ,   we focused on basic set of attributes which are business critical and important for the creators . The   first iteration of creation form tested our understanding of the attributes and their usage by the   creators . 

 Iteratively , we included other complex attributes with a continuous feedback from the creators . The   second and third iterations tested our assumption - ‘ prioritization of complex attributes against   the business milestones was the main cause of the challenge in developing the creation form ’ .   Again , with the continuous feedback by the creators , we were able to implement a meaningful   structure of attributes covering all aspects of the business in the application . 

 Insight : 

 Every consecutive iteration while building the new creation form not just built the creation form   for the creators in a non - intrusive way , it also helped us understand that business milestones was   the key for each of the attributes in creation form . This was the leverage for us to make the impact   and build an efficient creation form . 

 A noteworthy mention : by our first iteration we also placed a backend auto reporting tool which   traces sequentially the number of clicks , tabular movements & other user interface usage metrics .   The tracking tool was made aware to the creators as well during the card sorting exercise . With the   additional information from the tracking tool of UI , we were able to provide more value - adds to 

 the creators in their daily work of creation process . For example , creators use multiple text   attributes and type in the same value in different attributes which was traced by the tracking tool .   Accordingly , we developed a simple multiple select and copy - paste feature within the form view . 

 Approach : 

 The application with the new creation form proved to be the right approach which resulted in   creation efficiency increase by 95 % in comparison with the old school excel and email exchange   mode of creation . Then onwards every product that was built was created by the tool . The simple   creation form led to a development of complex lifecycle management tool and continues to be   built in an iterative way .

"Reflection – storytelling 

 Challenge & selection 

 As an industrial engineering student , I know that there will be many   challenges in my work life , so the industrial engineer develops skills that   allow the application of necessary tools for the prevention and solution of   quality problems , production , logistics and human relations , in this case we   can find that among the work personnel there may be difficulty of   understanding , poor communication and thus carry out a bad performance ,   therefore I choose the storytelling tool because with it we can take the   background of the problems that we face in a community as well as in the   video of the week one the good kitchen story where we found the problem of   the elderly and cooks , who did not have a good diet and were not giving   quality food but all these challenges that they entailed were about not having   good communication and why the elders were n't eating properly , but with the   help of the narrative ion managed to reach a solution of it and thus improve   in both parts . 

 Application & insight 

 The way to apply this way would be to create a health , mental health   program where it helps and comforts workers physically and mentally , thus   giving an advance and effectiveness in the workplace . By obtaining this type   of space in a company , it can be ensured that the emotional and physical   burden of the workers would improve , thus giving good results both in their   work areas and at home , the fact of living loaded with worries and others   make These do not have a good quality , but with the help of training in   health , mental health they will have new possibilities of opening up to each   other and giving the method of communication which leads us to the   narrative . 

 Approach 

 .For the next time , what could be done is to use methods of arrival and   approach with the worker in his workspace , taking into account the different   perceptions of each one , it could be handled with surveys to know what his 

 field of work is like as a family member . To carry out a prevention of   problems that would arise later , avoiding the inefficiency of the worker   achieving a good work performance

"Example Reflection – Story Telling 

 Challenge : 

 The recent times are certainly of an unprecedented demeanor which was ubiquitous in my   internship experience . I interned as a growth executive in a fintech start - up    which primarily   deals with airline invoice procurement and streamlining indirect taxation operations   through automated platforms . In recent times the airline industry has taken a hit due to less   travels affecting the business revenue in a significant way . In such times , the sales team was   struggling to meet their targets and the existing clients did not do much to add to the ever- decreasing revenue . 

 So , in a time like this where the work was also getting hectic due to lockdowns and people   not being able to communicate freely on online platforms , it was a smart move by the CEO   of the firm to go for motivational sessions everyday first thing in the morning . In this session   one employee was chosen randomly as the champion of the day and he / she would present   to the team . The session rolled out , people started following this practice of sharing a   motivational video which was more or less of the same content : hardcore workouts , sports   theme and people struggling , fighting hard to get to their goals and so on . 

 To this , I had a different view as I saw work as not a duty but an expression of the exuberant   life that blossoms within each of us . And I had to take a different approach of motivating my   team , which was , story - telling . 

 Selection : 

 My selection of story telling as a tool to motivate the team is from this notion that a story   will give a clear picture of the message that I am trying to convey than directly conveying   the message itself . And story is a beautiful way to express the message as it gives the   listener freedom to harness the value of the message through his imagination and   influences him / her to respond in a particular way .   Moreover , story telling would help the   team give them the necessary break from their devices as they would be focusing on   listening than watching the screen as they do for 8 - 10 hours every day . 

 The biggest factor why I chose story telling as a tool lies in the theme of the message itself ,   of what I was trying to convey to my team mates . 

 The message was that , work is not something which should be seen as a duty , it is rather an   expression of the life that we are . The modern times has made us goal - oriented which has   left us focusing on the goal more , instead of the work that we are doing at present . And this   leads to frustrations as goals are not met and results in reduced productivity . 

 But if we are joyful by our own nature of conscious living , we find ourselves pulsating with   energy that finds expression in the work that we do . And that when realized can lead to   profoundness of activity . 

 So , storytelling was one way to strike a chord in tune with the current reality to get that   rippling effect of exuberance from the team mates . 

 Application : 

 So , to strike the right chord I used a passive character and three main characters . These   three main characters were three different persona of individuals which we find in every   workplace . One was quite of the nature of living in the past , the second one was absolute   goal - oriented ( living in the future ) and the third was a unique kind which we shall discover   later in this report . 

 In this story on one particular day , a wanderer who was curiously venturing the forest came   across a large group of workers busy in building a temple . He approaches these three   individuals and asks them all the same question , “ what are you doing ? ” And each has a   different response . 

 I used this approach of using responses of each character to resonate more or appeal more   to my team mates as these are typical reactions and anyone can empathize more aptly . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 In the story the first worker responds to this question of what he was doing in quite a   negative way as he was quite frustrated in carrying the big stones as he had an unpleasant   past experience of breaking his back while doing so . So , he reacts to the question : “ ca n’t you   see I am trying to lift this heavy rock trying not to break my back ! ” In my workplace I   witnessed people heavily impacted by their past weekly performance which took a huge toll   on their present work . So , I used this to cater to majority of people in my team . 

 The second worker was more of a future - goal oriented personality who responded to the   same question like this : “ I am trying to earn a living here , please do n’t waste my time here . ”   This was also a typical response in my firm not just confined to the team mates but also can   be extended to the clients that we were facing as most of our clients were from airline   industry and they were busy in formulating new business models to cater to future deficits   already at place due to reduced travel activity . 

 Now the third worker had a different aura about him , as he was cheerfully carrying big   heavy stones on his back like they were light bags of wool and singing melodious tunes to   himself . He joyfully responds , “ I am trying to build a magnificent temple in the middle of this   forest . ” This is the central character of the story who can be seen as the ideal person to be   working in any firm . And this does n’t mean a radical transformation , just a joyful mind and a   necessary awareness of the moment , that ’s all . 

 The story was well appreciated by the CEO and he also replied that he was now in a happier   mood after listening to the story . The team mates also gave positive feedback about the   same . 

 This experience truly enhanced my perceptions about the mind and energy aspects of any   person . And story telling is a great tool because it makes people believe the necessary   aspects and relate to themselves in a profound manner thus creating a significant impact . 

 And the result was evident as people were more cheerful in my team . We also had a virtual   dinner session with the team late in the evening which invigorated a sense of togetherness ,   key to the healthy functioning of any firm . 

"
"Challenge 

 We have a team of engineers in our IT company that work on projects for mainly government   customers . The government agencies that we provide services to are mainly responsible for ensuring   that they can provide high quality services to the impoverished communities that they operate in . 

 Our main challenge is that we often face challenges motivating the team to ensure that when they spec   their project they do not miss requirement or look at the problem from multiple angles since most of   them are usually distanced from the end users of our products . 

 As such our main challenge is the inability of our engineering team to empathise with our end user and   as such sometimes creates solutions that do not talk to our customer and as such lowers our customer   satisfaction ratings . 

 Selection 

 The tool that I have decided to use to remedy the challenge that we had was <NAME> . It is a   technique that I had seen producing greqt results before when used in similar situations to try and get   the team to connect with the value that they are providing and to attach meaning to the work that we   do . Many of the people that our agencies service usually do nt have the resources to fill in online surveys   or go into service centres to lay formal complaints and give feedback on improvements to the services   that they need and as such their point of view is seldom heard . Allowing these people a chance to tell   their stories through either recorded interviews or face to face engagements allowed us some insights   into thier daily lives and situations . 

 Insights & Approach 

 An amazing example of were we saw storytelling providing us with immerse value was in 1 example   were we had a single mother come explain / tell us about her experience around what it takes her to   bring her child in for a regular visit at a clinic . She explained how on days when she has to visit the clinic   she would have to wake her and her 2 children up at 3:30am to go heat up water for bathing and food ,   how since her husband is usually away on work for weeks at sometimes there is no one to assist . That   she would then have to walk both children up to 10 km to school before walking another 4 km to gett to   the clinic . All of this effort only to find a queue at the clinic with people who had been there for hours   already . Then by the time she gets her opportunity sometimes the nurses have run out of medication   or   they end up miss treating them cause they would have been working non stop for many hours   sometimes without any lunch . 

 A new element that this approach have uncovered for us was that it was not only the end users that we   had to solution for but that in other for us to make any meaningful impact , but that we also had to find   innovative ways to solution for the entire value stream . 

 With this input we found that when given free reign to come up with innovative solutions the   engineering team was able to fully grasp the scale and importance of the solution and come up with   solutions that were both cost conscious and time sensitive . 

 They built scheduling systems that allow the clinic to set a schedule for which people should come   when , they also built the ability to base this schedule based on the inventory of medicines that were   available for various procedures . 

 The process and examples and tools that were provided in this course made gave the me the ability to   see different ways to tackling the problem , and making a positive change in our communities .

"Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge : 

 I work at a pizza station and my challenge is to improve our system to get a differ of our rivals . The   restaurant is now table - serviced and our project is based on getting the speed of self - service without the   disanadvantages of it . First , we split to two teams . Teams are consisted of workers ( cooks , waiters ,   cleaners , couriers ) and customers ( students , couples , elders ) . To truly identify the problems we went   over desing thinking tools and agreed upon using <NAME> <NAME> . 

 Selection : 

 To get true insights we believed <NAME> <NAME> is the logical and team work optional choice . Our teammates   were willing to work on it which gave rise the thought that they will be mainly active through the project .    On Mind Map tool , even the smallest idea can be linked to the grand solution . A tool we can use   elements like combining , adding or subtracting tasks . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what you did and   how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 First of all , we used giant post - it 's like a gallery in order to truly identify the problems , used visual   contents , keywords and all other elements of the restaurant(tables and chairs , menu , kitchen , wc .. ) and   assured the teams to write any idea that came to mind . Working class team focused on their own   workload , difficulties and disadvantages . Client team on the other hand focues on better care ,   innovation and their demands . I combined the two teams identified problems and to sort them in order   of importance , I took a poll . Based on the results , I put together a new mind map post - it gallery on the   walls and asked the participants to add their solutions to the problems(doing so helped us to think freely   without the requirements of technology and funding ) . The results were truly amazing . I was urged to   decide on which path we should choose to proceed on "" what wows "" section . We prepared a new mind   map process and decided to give a try on the most basic , prototypable idea . How the restaurant truly   differs from its rivals by the outcome of Design Thinking was fascinating . 

 Insight 

 Mind Map tool is very useful on improving our working system because it allows us to see keywords   and form new connections . It allows teamwork and even the smallest idea can be the core of a huge   system . Desing Thinking guides us achieving solutions we do n't usually come up with on daily life , safe   and sound . 

 Approach : 

 Mind Map tool was very successful . We obtained new insights and they became the main core of our   design . 

 But next time i 'm going to give a shot to visualization method because mind map tool focuses on a   specific scale of freedom ; while each participant is independant they obsess on keywords , same king of   insights occur . I believe visualization method can be more genuine and freethinking .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I work in the technical training department of my organization . Part of my job is to educate our field   engineers on various critical maintenance activities involved in our equipment ’s by developing   procedures in the form of videos and documents then share them to the engineers working in the field .   Since some of the activities are critical for better function of our equipment we have internal portal to   keep track and make sure all the engineers who required to perform those critical tasks are completed   these courses . But we still have been hearing from the field that our equipment are not performing   optimal and also there were incidents of damaging to our equipment ’s during the critical maintenance   activities . 

 I went to the field to investigate this issue and found out the engineer who were performing these   critical maintenance activities were skipping various steps that is recommend in my procedure . When   asked I was told field engineers thought it those steps were not deemed necessary . 

 Selection 

 My team has been already involved in educating other groups for a similar issue in the past . During our   internal team discussion , we decided to use learning launch tool since this appeared to be the well   suitable for our problem . 

 Application 

 Instead of just sending the procedures in the form of videos and documents I decided to go to the field   with all the necessary tools , 3D printed model of our equipment ’s and various exercise materials . I also   prepared questionnaire table which contained various questions regards the challenges faced by field   engineers and other useful information to make the session more interactive as well as practical . 

 On the day of our training we divided engineers 5 / training session . I had explained field engineer ’s   importance of each step in technical details . Later I let them try to perform the tasks by using the 3D   printed models which helped them to get trained hands on . I also carefully watched them practicing the   activity to made sure they are performing all the steps with an excepted precision . 

 Next day same engineers performed the same task on the real equipment , after testing found out the   equipment outperformed and local team was praised by the customer . 

 During my QA session I learned there were multiple opportunity to reduce the duration of the   maintenance activity which adds up to significant cost savings . 

 Insight 

 By applying learning launch tool , we have learned that the interpretation of our procedures might be   vary based on the engineers who is performing the task . Also learned there is better understanding   when the field engineers get a chance to practice the task hands on rather than watching videos or   reading documents . 

 Going forward we are planning to have more hands - on training for the field engineers , especially for the   newly joined engineers . 

 This exercise also helped to understand the field engineers needs and challenges they are facing while   performing various tasks . We also learned multiple design changes that will improve our equipment ’s   performance . 

 Approach 

 I already identified improvement that can be made to my last learning launch session . We are already   identified multiple locations where they are facing similar issues . Plan is to conduct similar trainings for   our field engineers in those location with planned improvements .

"Queuing System – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am a leader of a team in charge of new technologies within the engineering arm of a technology   company . We are always tasked with generating new ideas ( technical ) that could be potential products   of the company . One challenge we were asked to find a solution for is how to make procedures within   government entities more efficient for their customers ( individuals and companies ) . The challenge   seems very broad and unfocused due to the diversity of government entities , their customers and type   of services . 

 Selection 

 For the company ’s point of view , it made more sense to have a solution that is generic and applicable to   all entities , customers and services . Whatever this solution could be , we decided to use Learning Launch   as a tool to verify the effectiveness of the solution . <NAME> <NAME> is the most logical design thinking   tool that we could think of to test our concept in a cheap and rapid way . The prototype or proof of   concept that we will develop and use in learning launch campaign would provide great insight on the   future product and valuable feedback from potential users and customers . 

 Application 

 Even though we selected learning launch as a design thinking tool , we had to start from the beginning of   the design thinking process to identify the problem and find a solution for . The best way was to interact   with real customers and governmental entities . We formed teams that had to visit different   governmental customer service centers and perform interviews with real customers waiting in line for   their service . Furthermore , we went the extra mile and made some of our team members to apply for   some services on those centers and write down notes and collect feedbacks . Such trips and feedbacks   were very useful in providing the necessary data that helped us to identify core and common challenges   within those entities . We found out that there was one common complaint and challenge between all   centers and that was the waiting time that customer needed to endure in order to be served . And those   issues are all related to the queuing system in place . 

 We started with a hypothesis that what if customers could retrieve their tickets in the queue ( waiting   line ) through the internet ( a mobile application for instance ) and receive real time updates on the status   of the queue . Therefore , customers can utilize their waiting times in more valuable way than just waiting   on the service centers . We developed a small prototype that was a mobile friendly web page with   simple interface that communicates with a local server ( hence , users during the test phase do not have   to download and install an application ) . We arranged a test scenario on a nearby university campus   where we set our mock service center . Our service was free donuts and our customers were students   and faculty members . Customers had to interact with our team and answer some questions about the   prototyped queuing system we developed . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 The test bed we had set was very useful and informative . We got a lot of improvement suggestions from   the students on how they expect the system to work and how they wish to interact with the system . Too 

 many insights on the user interface itself ( although it was a beta version ) were collected that helped   produce a better user friendly interface for the product phase . Furthermore , we were surprised by the   number of stories that our customers started telling us about their experiences within government   entities and how the prototyped concept could made their experience better . Hence , the learning   launch experiment provided more data that enriched the data we collected during the study and   observation phase . 

 The approach we followed in implementing learning launch tool was very useful and it reduced the cost   and development time . Furthermore , it provided great insights on how the product could be developed   and how users would interact with the system in the future . In addition , it reduced the risks of entering   an unknown territory in respect to our company ’s current portfolio . However , I think there are ways we   could do better and shorten the learning launch phase and as well as reduce the cost of prototype   development . I think we could follow another approach that does not require the development of a beta   version in order to test . We could invite our customers to our mock service center and let them interact   with a mock system that is manually controlled . Perhaps , we could give our customers the freedom to   manipulate the user interface system as they think more convenient instead making them interact with   a baseline design . That way , the design would have been improved greatly due to the fact that it would   be open to a more diverse designing team .

"Visualization 

 Challenges : 

 An organization that has an application online , the application acts as a middle man in delivering food   from the restaurant to the consumer . They approached me as their rating was getting low . I was tasked   to find a root cause as well as a possible solution to improve the rating of the application , For this   reason , I took the help of the Visualization tool . The week 1 video that was based on the Visualization   tool helped me in choosing this tool to find a possible solution to the problem . This tool works on the   principle of drawing and visual representation and I knew that to convey my message it ’s much better if   I take the help of drawings and videos as through that I be able to better convey my solution and the   organization be able to better understand what I want to convey to them . 

 Application : 

 The first thing I did was that I put up a survey form in which I asked multiple questions from random   customers such as , what issues they face while using the application ? If they have any possible solution   or what feature they suggest should be added to make it better ? Is the application user - friendly if not   please suggest any suitable changes ? The reviews that I got from the customers I wrote them down .   Moreover , I also had video reviews from random people who have or had used the application and   asked them what they think about it . After that I got hold of a bunch of people who never used the   application and made them use the application for a period of 1 week and whatever issues they faced   while using the application , I jotted them down separately . The main problem was the lack of   experienced customer care agents as users complained that the agents were not good enough . After   this I checked the training of the new agents checked for how many days they are being trained for   before they go the life and I found out that they were only trained for 1 week . Also , I interviewed   multiple agents asked them the issue that they been facing . After getting the valuable information , I   talked with the person who trains the new agents and told them to train one batch for a period of 2   weeks , and then I studied that batch when they went live and noted down their performances . 

 After I got the necessary data I made a PowerPoint presentation in which I graphically wrote all the   reviews as well as the video reviews that I gathered and then presented it to the managers of the   organization . Circling the reviews on the PowerPoint presentation that were being repeated and   focusing it on that . Secondly , I made a side by side comparison of the batch that was trained for 2 weeks   with the ones who were only trained for 1 week . I compared their performances ; I compared the   reviews that a 2 week trained agent received with the one who only got trained for 1 week . Then   keeping the 2 week trained agents score , I simulated the rating of the application if the training period is   changed to 2 weeks for the rest of the agents . 

 The visualization tool was quite effective as it helped me convince the managers that a more proper   training time period should be given to the agents for them to work more professionally and to fulfill the   needs of the users easily and effectively . 

 Insight & Approach : 

 The insight that I learned from using this tool was immense . It not only helped me find a suitable   solution to the problem but for me to explain the issue and the solution , the visual effects proved to be   quite vital . The video reviews that I used and the graphics , in general , helped me a lot in proving a point   to the managers . What I learned from visualization is that the audience tends to focus on it even more   as compared to none visual tools being used as the pictures , graphics , symbols are more appealing to   the eye and a person and convey his or her message quite easily and effectively .   The video reviews   helped me a lot . As when I saw them I was able to more broadly see the reviews better understand the   reviews and those reviews felt quite genuine . Furthermore , when I was working on my challenge I   realized that design thinking is quite helpful as it felt like a puzzle and I just had to put the right pieces at   the right place and design thinking proved to be the guide to do that . 

 In the future , if I was given a task I will definitely use a visualization tool as I realized that for the   audience to better understand visualization helps a lot . Also , visualization helped me in finding a   solution too as when I saw the video reviews as well as when I saw the training routine and talked with   the agents , I was able to determine a pattern and then one thing led to another .

"Challenge 

 Re - vitalize through new product introductions the neglected core business segment . 

    Over a period of years , the development resources of the core business segment ( call it   Segment A ) were stripped away in order to support an emerging , faster growing   business segment ( call it Segment B ) that had already exceeded the revenue of Segment   A 

    Segment A was comprised of many varied products and families of products that were   used to make similar types of components but which were different in design . The   applications and end markets were numerous . However , revenue from new products   was flat over several years reflecting the lack of investment , technically and marketing- wise . Still opportunities seem to exist . 

    Segment B grew rapidly , as its end market exploded driven by technology advancement .   Competition in Segment B ’s market was fierce . Product performance advantage drove   adoptions and technology advanced relatively quickly . When competition overcame   performance advantage , price was used to mitigate share erosion until performance   advantage could be regained . Hence , the felt need to increase Segment B resource level . 

    The overall business was becoming quickly synonymous with Segment B , which made it   vulnerable to Segment B ’s single application , single market and limited customer base . 

    Even two years after restoring Segment A ’s resources , performance fell significantly   short of promises both in terms of new product introductions and revenue generated . 

    The Business Unit Vice President expressed strong disappointment in the Segment A   Manager and the Business Manager ( Segment A Manager ’s boss ) and sought   reassurance than the past failures would not be repeated . 

    Better tracking and prioritization process were launched to improve execution .   However , the approach to new business development and new product introduction   remained basically unchanged . Except for a recent hire of a new Research Director , the   management and support across functions remained unchanged . 

 Selection 

 Visualization – charts , diagrams , cartoons , maps , photos , videos , performances and anything which one   sees as a means to surface and resolve discord with that presented or missing ; so that , the final edited   depictions are   ones on which all agree are accurate and appropriate for the problem . While being used   here for problem definition , visualization could be used to create discussions and alignment throughout   the entire Design Thinking process . ( Ref :   <NAME> <NAME> video on Visualization in the Week 1 material ) 

    Visualization is a means which could lead to a consensus understanding of the   challenge , and all relevant conditions , considerations and gaps that should be addressed   for a successful outcome . 

    It enables a holistic , strategic assessment of the “ environmental ” factors that influence   success . 

    It is a means to capture / consider the inputs from all stakeholders and subject matter   experts . 

    Visualization builds ownership and teamwork by assuring the voices of key   people / functions are heard at the beginning . 

    It is a means to assimilate all relevant information that enables people to more readily   identify levers that might enable success and weaknesses that could lead to failure . 

    It is a process that takes more time and cost than you want to spend but less time and   cost than fixing issues resulting from a poor understanding and redress of the current   state 

 I think visualization would have aligned all stakeholders on the factors that influenced segment   management decisions and execution . Visualization requires one to communicate through images which   helps clarify “ what , when , how and with whom ”   for review and discussion . 

 Although most of us had worked together for several years , my stakeholders still were a diverse group - functionally , by organizational level , by nationality , by language and by training / education . We did n’t   hear or process information the same way . We had n’t the same understanding or experiences .    Pictures / diagrams / process maps and the opportunity to edit them would have helped us create and   ensure a common understanding of the current state . 

 Application 

 First , I would describe the current state as well as possible through graphs , diagrams , and process maps .   This would include expectations , performance and a review of a representative sample of projects . I   would annotate the diagrams and process maps with sketches , cartoon and photos . I would incorporate   input from the two managers that were key stakeholders . Second , I would seek corrections ,   amendments and comments from the people in Research , Technical Service , Marketing , Sales and   Business Management that were performing or supporting the activities . In particular , I would seek to   learn about their execution problems and the barriers and challenges they faced . Finally , after having   gathered the inputs I would try to synthesize 2 - 3 definitions of the current state based upon these   inputs and the starting materials .   These definitions then would be used in the “ What If ” stage to   develop families of possible re - vitalization through new product solutions . 

 Insight 

 As I thought about using visualization for defining “ What Is ” , I struggled with scope and what to include   and what not ; what has been missed . I try to imagine the activity itself and the people who would   participate . What information would they feel was needed ; what information or resulting discussions 

 would enhance their engagement . I wonder how best to present information and perspectives . I am   sketching on paper the activities , defining them and considering how they relate . I am creating a mental   image of the interactions .   Basically , I am visualizing the construct of the visualization that I would use to   enable definition of the “ What Is ” state . 

 <NAME> 

 Rather than first developing the exercise material alone , I could engage the two other stakeholders from   the start . Doing so , the work load would be shared and the preparation time reduced but more   importantly , they would have ownership from the start and the materials would reflect consensus . 

 Another alternate approach was tried . The projected number of new product commercializations and   the resulting revenue was challenged based upon history but the challenge proved insufficient to   meaningfully alter the management approach and the results . This alternate approach failed because   the issues of the current state were not sufficiently understood and hence , interest in an alternate   management approach was not developed .

 Design Thinking Technique adopted : SCAMPER 

 POVs obtained from the user : 

 •   The user wants the water level monitoring system to be accessed in either LAN or WAN . 

 •   The user wish to incorporate non - contact sensors in the operation . 

 •   The user wants the system to be any of the one be it electrical , pneumatic , hydraulics etc . 

 •   The user needs to monitor the water level in real - time . 

 Limitations in designing the prototype : 

 •   Unavailability of sensors , breadboards , Wi - Fi module and Arduino UNO . 

 •   The project should be executed without involving the above listed components also it should not   compromise the basic functionalities . 

 In order to obtain the solution for the problem , the SCAMPER technique is used for the ideation purpose . 

 SCAMPER : 

 Creative thinking and problem - solving are essential parts of the design process to turn ideas into innovation and   break the barriers against creativity . One of the successful methods used in creative thinking is the SCAMPER   technique . The SCAMPER technique is based very simply on the idea that what is new is actually a modification of   existing old things around us . 

 Substitute : 

 The substitute technique focuses on the parts in the product , service or solution that can be replaced with another . 

 Ideations : 

 1 . Instead of using separate dedicated sensors , it can be replaced with other sensors already fitted in different 

 devices such as Infrared in remotes , Sensors in <ADDRESS> , sensors in other such electrical devices . 

 2 . For the purpose of sensor data acquisition we can think of other methods such as usage of apps in mobile .   3 . Replacing electrical wires and circuits , we can use wireless components . 

 Combine : 

 The combine technique tends to analyse the possibility of merging two ideas , stages of the process or product in one   single more efficient output . 

 Ideations : 

 1 . We can combine the functionalities of both data acquisition and data transmission by using a single device .   2 . Instead of having a separate cloud service we can make use of commercial packages which has inbuilt cloud 

 service to store its data and coding scripts . 

 Adapt : 

 Adapt refers to a brainstorming discussion that aims to adjust or tweak product or service for a better output . This   adjustment can range between minor changes to radical changes in the whole project . 

 <NAME> ( Design Thinking and Innovation ) 

 Ideations : 

 1 . We can make use of coding in commercial software so that we can make the process flexible .   2 . Adapting techniques such as UDP ( User Datagram Protocol ) may improve the process . 

 Modify / Magnify : 

 The modify technique refers to changing the process in a way that unleashes more innovative capabilities or solves   problems . This change is more than just adjustment as it focuses on the overall process . 

 Ideations : 

 1 . By using smartphones and apps we can modify the conventional method sensor data acquisition i.e. ) by 

 using sensors and Arduino . 

 2 . Accordingly the float have to be redesigned in order to aid the process . 

 Eliminate : 

 As the name implies , this technique aims to identify the parts of the process that can be eliminated to improve the   process product or service . It also helps to explore the unnecessary parts of the project . 

 Ideations : 

 1 . If we follow the above mentioned ideas we can eliminate the use of dedicated sensors , Arduino , circuit 

 boards and Wi - Fi modules . 

 2 . By using comprehensive commercial packages we can discard the use of intermediate cloud services .   3 . Usage of wireless components eliminates wired connections . 

 Prototype design : 

 By making use of the ideations through SCAMPER technique the prototype is designed based on that . From the   available sensors in a Smartphone we could make use of the magnetometer which reads the intensity magnetic   field around the mobile . Using a magnet we could read the magnetic field intensity from the magnetometer . The   float was designed in such a way that the top of the surface is attached with a magnet . When it floats it is captured   by the smartphone ’s magnetometer . Hence the magnetic field intensity was directly proportional to the water level   in the tank . Data communication between the smartphone and the pc is done through UDP ( User Datagram   Protocol ) . UDP app sends the magnetometer data from mobile to the PC through a LAN network ( Wi - Fi ) . For   visualizing the upcoming data <NAME> platform is used . Coding is developed to receive the transmitted UDP packets   of data and is visualized through <NAME> .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge      3 Years back , I had been requested from my company ’s ( a leading group for building and operating   shopping malls across MENA ) technical director to look at the security surveillance systems and how   technology can help them to modernize and innovate the surveillance experience . To achieve the   mission I used to meet with all the relevant stakeholders , who are the control room operators , the   security managers , the mall operations manager , the asset directors and the police department in order   to understand all their requirement and classify them .    This gave me the opportunity to better understand the needs of each group as well as define the   solution criteria .     Selection     Me and my team selected to use the learning Launch , actually at that time I was n’t aware of that name   but I was following the “ seeing is believing ” rule , building a small example in order to document what ’s   good and what ’s not , collect stakeholders feedback and any improvement they would like to see or get   their approvals to move to bigger or scale installation of the solution .      Application      Initially , the process started by contacting all the potential surveillance system integrators and discuss   their solutions , mapping it to the solution criteria developed after understanding the stakeholder ’s   requirements and organise them from the most matching the criteria to the least matching and provide   a reason for each design elements whether it is matching or not .      I always use KPI matrix template contains 3 columns and multiple rows showing the design criteria ,   system integrator rating for each KPI and the detailed reason for the rating . This is clearly visualise to the   stakeholders the potential solutions .      Eventually , we asked all the potential system integrators to install a demo of their solutions in order to   gather information related to how easy to install , how long it will take to operate , does the solution   provide the promised quality ? . We convert one of our meeting rooms into a selection room , where we   installed multiple screens connected to each of the installed solutions . We also provide number for each   screen and of course we hidden all the system integrators or manufacture information . We then provide   a selection sheet to each of the stakeholders and requested them to rate each of the systems shown in   each screen based on the stakeholder ’s needs collected during the initial stage . Surprisingly , the   stakeholder ’s selection or voting for the system was in line with our technical recommendation which   was not shown to them prior to the selection stage .     Management approves to launch the solution at one of the smallest shopping malls we own as a   Learning Launch in order to confirm or not the suitable of the solution in a real life situation not only on   a technical lab . The learning launch had demonstrate to the business team and the stakeholders the   powerful of the solution and how easy is the installation , operation and maintenance 

 In the first few days , the security team had reported an increase of capturing security incidents inside   the shopping malls by 60 % compared with the old system which was still running on parallel with the   learning launch system . That was enough to the business to approve the solution to be rolled out at all   of our shopping malls . We now have completed the installation for 15 shopping malls with more than   6000 cameras centrally managed from our head offices .      Insights      What I learnt from conducting the learning launch that it is very important to do the small experiment of   the idea in a real live situation outside the lab , along with engaging the relevant customers and   continuous gathering their feedback to confirm or enhance the idea .   The learning launch gave the stakeholders a starting point to discuss their point of view and agree on a   way forward , it also gave them the opportunity to interact with the project team .      Approach      According to the feedback we received and the successful of the learning launch tool at the above   mission , we are now using the learning launch at most if not all of our projects .   Learning launch helped us to interact with the business team in their language not using the technical   language and that overcome the main problem when interacting with technical teams .      We are now using learning launch in other innovation solutions like the malls indoor navigation , the   malls Wi - Fi solution and the SMART parking solution which prove every time that it is a powerful tool   not just to prove the ideas but to start a strong relation with the customers and drive a massive   feedback channel .     I will continue using it as the best visualization tool for any of the innovation ideas we propose to the   business users .

"A , <NAME> <NAME> is a diagram used to visually organize information . A mind   map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the   whole . It is often created around a single concept , drawn as an image in   the center of a blank page , to which associated representations of ideas   such as images , words and parts of words are added . Major ideas are   connected directly to the central concept , and other ideas branch   out from those major ideas . Mind maps can also be drawn by hand ,   either as "" notes "" during a lecture , meeting or planning session , for   example , or as higher quality pictures when more time is available . Mind   maps are considered to be a type of spider diagram . A similar concept in   the 1970s was "" idea sun bursting "" . 

 A mind map is a graphical way to represent ideas and concepts . It is a   visual thinking tool that helps structuring information , helping you to   better analyze , comprehend , synthesize , recall and generate new ideas .   Just as in every great idea , its power lies in its simplicity .   In a mind map , as opposed to traditional note taking or a linear text ,   information is structured in a way that resembles much more closely how   your brain actually works . Since it is an activity that is both analytical and   artistic , it engages your brain in a much , much richer way , helping in all   its cognitive functions . And , best of all , it is fun !

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am an engineering student and due to covid 19 pandemic I was completing my graduation from   home . My father is a shop owner and I occasionally help him in running it whenever I get the time   from my studies . Covid 19 pandemic impacted on our shop business to due to lockdown restrictions   all over the country our sales fell down by huge numbers . Since the shop was allowed to open for   few hours during the day and had to be remain closed on weekends the sales were minimal , But the   real challenge came after the lockdown was over . After lockdown sales increased a little but hey   were not same as before . To overcome this problematic situation , I made various case reports on   how I can help in increasing the sales by finding out the reasons behind why customers were not   coming to shop and what approaches to use to get back on track after hard times . 

 Selection 

 I along with my father discussed the repercussions of covid and how it has impacted on consumers ,   then I gone through various thinking process to find optimal approach to talk to customers and   gather data to get results on how the sales were impacted and reasons behind so much customers   not buying from our shop . Mind mapping is the greatest tool of design thinking which can be used to   collect data and gather insights which might be missed in normal thinking processes . 

 Application 

 I started with a single idea which was finding insights on local customers by mapping their daily   needs and activities to gather insight in their lives about how they spent money on general   household items . I asked customers who coming to our shop to put a sticky note on the chart which   was <ADDRESS> of shop telling what they like about our shop and what they except from us in terms of   quality , quantity of products , our customer relationships . I also floated online forms asking   customers two things about our shop what makes us different from other shops and how would   they rate us in terms of our marketing experience . We used different colour notes for different level   of ratings and user experience . We collected data at the end of each day and start making clusters   with help of customers like how we can improve section , what we do best , ratings of our services . 

 Insight 

 The first insight we found that people were concerned for their safety in the pandemic times so they   were more likely to order online things if necessary or buy things in less quantity because of financial   problems everyone was facing due to lockdowns and economic slowdown . The second insight was   those timings of shop opening were not very compatible with customers as there were restrictions   on allowed movement people had to do all their works in that time on because of that they were   getting late and not able to reach shop on time . 

 Approach 

 The Approach we used was simple we first asked customers to text their grocery list to us and tell us   about the timing when they will come to get their products . We packed their orders in advanced   which saved time and customers have n’t had to wait to get their groceries which resolved the issue   of time management in restrictions of movement after lockdown . We increased our marketing by   giving customers free printed masks with our shops logo to encourage people to wear masks and   also it acted as advertisement or our shop . We also allowed customers a two days relief period in   which customers were given their orders on time and the needy ones were given offer to pay the   bills in two time period . Customers were given option of the orders were greater than a certain   amount then they were given offer to pay in two instalments within the time period through online   transaction . For our safety and customers protections we installed plastic sheets to protection   against the virus and customers were instructed to wear masks and sanitize them at the entry of   shop . This mind mapping tool allowed us to find analysis of our customer needs and offer a strategic   solution to a problem using design thinking innovation .

"Challenge & Selection 

 I work in the Budget Office of a local government agency where I meet frequently with the Health and   Human Services department ’s budget . One of their program ’s budgets is the Adult Drug Court .   The   Adult Drug Court allows people who have been arrested for non - violent drug offenses to avoid jail time   by enrolling in addiction treatment services , meeting with private counselors , attending group therapy   sessions , obtaining employment and stable housing , and most importantly meeting with the Drug Court   Judge on a weekly basis to discuss their progress in the program . Once the person graduates from the   program , has a stable job and housing , and passes all drug tests , then the criminal drug charges are   deleted from the court record . 

 In evaluating budgets , the Budget Office uses performance metrics , such as the average length of stay in   the program , relapse rate , and how long after graduating the participants relapse , and average cost per   participant to evaluate how effective the program is . Almost all the data I report does not show the   individual ’s journey . As a result , I found it difficult to defend the high program cost and its impact on the   community . 

 I realized this was a great opportunity to engage in storytelling . I would gain the logic , emotion , and   connection to the Adult Drug Court ’s purpose . I could hear their stories about how the Drug Court   positively impacted their lives . That way , I could share their experiences of getting a job , finding housing ,   and finding recovery in my program summary with the Budget Director to maintain program funding . 

 Application 

 I decided to spend the day with a couple of the program counselors to better understand their clients ’   challenges and attend a session of the Adult Drug Court where I could hear from the participants   themselves about the program impact . I noticed one participant who looked proud and confident as the   Judge reviewed his weekly progress . She commented on his breakthrough in therapy and that his new   job seemed to be working well for him . He responded that he had faced some challenges in battling his   addiction , but the tools the counselors gave him were very effective . He also noted that working made   him feel proud that he was contributing to society again and could support himself financially .   I shared   his story during our budget meetings to support the department ’s increased funding request for the   Drug Court . Based on this experience , combined with the performance metrics data , the Budget Director   approved the request . 

 Insight 

 The understanding I received from this site visit combined with a design thinking method of problem   solving has motivated me to increase the number of “ site visits ” that I attend during the year .    Experiencing the programs ’ operations will allow me to respond to questions and concerns that service   providers , the Department and the Budget Office have . I will also see the programs ’ community impact   and determine if some programs do not work well . During our annual budget discussion , I can   incorporate storytelling by drawing on specific examples from my site visits to clearly illustrate the   program ’s function and efficacy . 

 Approach 

 To improve the storytelling approach , I would increase my interaction with the program participants .    Speaking with their counselors and hearing their testimony was extremely effective in gathering   program information , but I did not have the opportunity to speak with the participants themselves . If I   spoke directly with them , I could ask questions about what they thought worked well , could be   improved , or hindered their progress in completing the program . I could then combine their personal   accounts with the other perspectives , such as the counselors and Health and Human Services staff , and   the performance metric data to make more robust funding recommendations . 

 I could also alter my approach by selecting multiple site visit dates for the same program and see how   program participation varies by the season . This would enable me to ensure that the program staff   did n’t pick the most successful participants on the day I attended and that the program is consistent   throughout the year .

"Story telling – Solving customer problems 

 Challenge 

 I am working as Project Manager in <ADDRESS> ( <NAME> ) . We develop   software based product for various report generation for batch   industries . We are facing the major challenge of product not user friendly   and thus not getting new customers or getting the existing customers to   migrate to our latest releases . Multiple attempts were done in the past   to improve user experience but we ended up in getting resistance from   the customers . Customers were not even ready to give their feedback or   listen to our initiatives which we wanted to take to improve user   experience and thus we were finding very difficult to generate the   revenue . 

 Selection 

 So , we decided to use <NAME> telling tool to help us with this challenge as   it helps build emotional connection . We just did not want to solve the   problem but we also wanted to create a cause . So , we thought that   <NAME> is the best tool which can help us with this challenge . It is   really a great tool that allows a business to convey a message by allowing   your audience to emotionally connect to your subject . 

 Application 

 The first and foremost thing we did was to understand our customers as   a good story is designed for the audience and it is something which your   audience understands and your audience knows . Before even going to   the customer we did lot of homework to understand them , where do 

 they come from , and what do they need and then we put down clear   sequence of events in such a way it is well understood . We created a very   compelling story , something that is of interest , something that is   powerful and something that we were sure that customer is going to   listen .   We presented hard facts and recommendations . We located the   most powerful part of our message and leaned on it which helped in   creating moments of reflection and customers started showing lot of   interest in us . 

 Insight 

 Thus , we realized that it was the perfect decision to use story telling tool   to solve our problem and it was the best way to get our audience to pay   attention to us . The concept of Design Thinking helped to understand our   customers better and build trust with the customers by building strong   connection with them . Finally , we started getting good number of orders   for our latest releases and we also started getting good number of orders   from new customers after we improved our product based on the   feedback received in various story telling sessions . It was really a great   achievement for us as with 2 years our revenue got doubled . 

 Approach 

 Storytelling tool helped us a lot in overcoming the challenged that we   faced but at the same time another tool that we will use in future along   with story - telling tool is ‘ Visualization ’ . This tool will further enhance our   story by making it even more tangible for customers to understand our   concepts . We will also use more pictures and videos when telling the   story which will create even better impact .

"Finding if main assumption is right – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 A group of friends and I have come together to create a website that provides customers SEO   services for their personal websites and business accounts on different social media . Within the   team we have Full Stack Developers , Marketing Analyst Experts , Finance and Salespeople . We   already have developed the core functionalities of the platform , SEO leads procedures and a   business plan and we are almost ready to launch the company with the website . But we still have   not defined WHO will be our target audience , and which will be our minimum viable audience to   proceed our business activities . We have some assumptions about our clients are going to be   middle size companies so we think it will be a B2B company . Still we have to find out if this is the   case . 

 Selection 

 The website has already been launched as a beta , so our team already has some data about   clients visits and interaction with our website . Since we do not know yet who will be our main target ,   we have decided to use the Learning Launch Tool to try different customer segments and see   which of them fits best with our value proposition . 

 Application 

 For the process of finding out WHO is this target we are aiming , the company has developed the   beta version of the platform , also known as the MVP ( minimum viable product ) , this one does not   contain all the features we have come up with , just the ones that contains the core functionalities to   test if our assumptions are right . 

 Since we have Marketing Analysts experts , we have divided the visitor in many groups dividing   them between the time they spend online , the device they are using , the interactions they have with   us . And finally , when do they leave the site . 

 After finding out that the traffic online was big enough to validate the MVP , we proceeded to add   progressively the other features by the A / B Testing method . After that we have come up that the   customers that were more satisfied with all the features , after adjusting some that were not desired ,   we have come to the conclusion that our customer target where mid - size companies that wanted to   know how did they score at SEO qualifications compared with their competition . 

 During all this process we have been using the Lean approach to validate the assumptions and   create new ones , to validate knowledge fast and cheap . 

 Insight 

 By applying the Learning Launch Tool in combination with A / B Testing and the Lean Methodology ,   we have come up with the team that there where many features that we considered as valuable , but   the customers did n’t want at all . In this case we had to do a pivot on our strategy to adjust the   desired features and functionalities but at the same time aligning all the already existing validated   knowledge with the website . We where also very grateful we have applied this tool and method   because we could have gone to the public with many errors on our assumptions having big loses in 

 profit and killing the business in an early stage . Therefore this iterative process worked for us in   every stage of the creation of the platform . 

 Approach : 

 Due that this process ( Learning Launch Tool ) has been very well adopted by my team we will   certainly use it again in future project , nevertheless one aspect where we have failed on the   execution of the tool was that we did not have well defined the timing and the stages of this creation   of knowledge . For the next time we will come up with an elaborated schedule and standardize the   knowledge registration procedures to simplify the data analysis .

"Changing the Customer Culture at an insurance company 

 Challenge : 

 I work in a large insurance company and recently took over the Customer Experience department . Customer   satisfaction scores were dropping , our phone lines were clogged with unhappy customers and front line staff   ( call centre ) were really disengaged because they felt like they were bearing the brunt of all the operational   failures with customers . Back office staff refused to talk to customers , and would often not return calls or   emails from the call centre staff on customer issues .   I had to find a way to make all the back office teams   realise how some of their actions were really hurting customers and our brand , and start to build a little   empathy in the organisation . 

 Selection & Application 

 I chose story telling as my tool .   The company had previously hosted some customer service training , where   the trainer was not in the insurance industry , and our staff had trouble relating to her case studies of poor   customer service . To make the customers woes come alive , I knew I had to use stories and examples that our   staff could relate to – framed around our products , systems and processes .   I spent time with the Complaints   department , and selected several real complaints . I turned them into anonymous case studies , and divided up   the personas involved .   I organised to get a group of 30 back office staff across all functions – finance ,   operations , claims , underwriting etc – into a large room . I then broke them into teams of four people each .   Each team received one case study , and each case study was written from 3 different perspectives , that of the   customer , that of the front line staff handling the customer and that of the back office staff where ultimately the   problem had arisen . The fourth person ( “ the observer ” ) in the team got to view all perspectives .   The story was   told layer by layer , and usually ending up with the customer perspective . The observer had to piece it all   together . By using the story telling technique , we were able to include emotions and build up the problem ( and   resolution ) , focusing on the effort each side had gone to , to be understood . Each case study focused on how the   person felt while handing the issue – the customer was frustrated and lost , the call centre agent felt powerless   and stressed , and the back office staff felt hounded etc . At the end of the exercise , I revealed that these were   not embellished stories , but actual customer experiences within the last few months . Back office staff were   immediately connected to the customers and their role in triggering satisfaction or dissatisfaction . 

 <NAME> 

 This story telling tool worked better than I hoped .   Everyone agreed that the customers had actually behaved   really admirably during each service malfunction , and that is when we started to break down the myth that   customers are scary , angry and unreasonable ! It also helped me to understand that back office staff simply   did n’t connect the customer to their daily roles . By delving deeper , I could see that our own internal processes   were choking up the back office teams , and we were able to come up with some interesting innovative ideas on   how to change small processes with big impact . 

 Approach 

 I really loved this tool and it had a powerful impact . We realised that the way to change the customer culture   was not only to put everyone in the customers ’ shoes , but to show us our own individual role in customer   service . The only problem was it was related to only the story they worked on .   I decided to extend it further at   a later session .   I used Visualisation techniques to show each team how they were connected to the customer .   Once we had mapped out how each team was involved in the customer experience at all key moments of truth   ( like when customers make a claim ) , we began to experiment with simple questions around what the impact   would be if one team made a mistake that was n’t rectified , or if one team made a change without assessing the 

 impact to other teams further down the chain . Our staff could immediately see the impact , because the flow   was clearly shown in front of them , and everyone realised that if they were n’t serving the customer , they were   serving someone who was .

"Learning Launch for <NAME> <NAME> 

 1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 As part of my training , I worked with one of my clients , a small kitchen retail store , to   experiment with design thinking . The kitchen store has relocated to a new location within the   shopping mall and expanded their demonstration kitchen , with the anticipation that they would   be having lots of kitchen classes . They offered the same classes they had in their old location ,   but the previous demonstration kitchen was smaller , therefore they classes were not offered   on a regular basis . To better understand their target market , I walked them through a few   exercises : 

 I purchased the book that went with this course and followed all the steps in the process . I   started with an audit of the current marketing plan and sales forecast for the store . I then   created a project brief and design criteria document to ensure we were focusing on the right   elements for the project . I then followed the following steps : 

 •   Persona Mapping : By looking at the universe of their customers , and dissecting them   into 4 categories , we learned that the needs for each group was unique , however we did   identify some common needs . 

 •   Storytelling : we created a short story for each of the four personas to better identify   with their needs . 

 •   Brainstorming : We then held a brainstorm of various ways the store could better reach   the target audience and identified a healthy list of possible programs , promotions that   could be relevant to the target audience . 

 •   Learning Launch : From the ideas collected , we decided to test two in the form of a   Learning Launch . We wanted to test our assumptions on the topics to cover in the   classes while also validating our new understanding of social media desires / needs . We   conducted the learning launch for two ideas : 

 o   Preferences on cooking class topics 

 o   Preferences on social media content 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and why 

 you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture references ) . 

 We selected the Learning Launch framework to test our hypothesis . As mentioned in the video   by Ed <NAME> , we wanted to run an efficient test vs. spending lots of time developing a business   plan , only to find our hypothesis incorrect . The goal was to quickly identify if our assumptions   about our audience were correct . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what you 

 did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 As you can see above , we had a plan for the two learning launches . There were already weekly   cooking classes scheduled for the month , so we decided to use these weekly groups for our   learning launch . We had two oversized bulletin boards . One board listed possible cooking   class topics and the other listed social media posts . We then handed out a stack of small   round red , yellow and green stickers . We asked each participant to put a sticker next to the   topic they liked ( green ) , disliked ( red ) or were neutral on ( yellow ) .   At the end of each class we   drew two names for a $ 50 gift for participating . 

 The learning launch was conducted for 4 weeks and we learned a lot about preferences for   class topics and social media preferences . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your challenge 

 ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about design thinking   more broadly ) . 

 We found the following from doing our learning launch : 

 •   Healthy Cooking : There was a universal interest in ways to cook good tasting food that   was also healthy . Many people felt that cooking in a healthy way meant giving up   quality or satisfaction . By combining “ healthy ” with “ delicious ” in the title of classes , the   appeal of the classes increased . 

 •   Value Cooking : While not everyone is a budding <NAME> <NAME> , there are a lot of cooks   who are intimidated by cooking classes . Classes that highlighted saving money or time   were very popular . Also , classes that taught how best to plan for the week scored well . 

 •   Cooking classes as social interaction : We found that by proposing multiple classes in a   package , while highlighting the social interaction of meeting new people , scored high . 

 •   Social media preferences : Everyone was overloaded with social media posts . There was   not a “ need ” for additional media , but rather “ smart ” social media . They wanted to   know what was going on in the store from a cooking class perspective , what sales   might be going on and tips and tricks on using certain tools sold in the store . They did   not desire more visuals of food , but rather practical advice . We also found that   featuring the owners more in social media posts made for a unique connection   between the customers and the owners . People are craving for authentic experiences   and when they saw short videos and images of the owners using specific kitchen tools   in their own kitchen at home , the interest of the social media increased significantly . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you 

 selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 The Learning Launch was very helpful and validated some assumptions , while also discrediting   some other assumptions . I think the only limitation of this learning launch was the fact that we   were only targeting current kitchen cooking class participants and not new or potential   participants . The owners intend to take the findings from the learning launch and incorporate   them into a survey that will be sent to their loyal customers while also changing their social   media posts to see if there is an increase in likes or shares . A range of new cooking classes are   currently in development .

"Project Reflection - Design Thinking – Story Telling Tool     Challenge    I was a Finance Process lead on several global ERP implementation and transformation projects . One of   the clients is a distributor of Information technology products and services , having business locations   globally .    As we know story telling is a powerful communication tool that enables us as a human being to   understand more about our emotional experiences . This makes it an effective method to use during the   design process .   We used story telling as a part of in our entire design phases while following the agile methodology .   Majority of the business processes agree with the design thinking and well aligned with storytelling .    The Challenge we have on the country specific localizations due to the local laws and regulations . One of   the recent examples is BREXIT ( British exit from EU countries )   Selection    We have already gone through several design thinking activities / tools part of the agile methodology . We   have selected and followed unique approach . We have on boarded local subject matter expert from UK   and developed a country specific template and talk through using story telling tool .     Application    During the design phase , we on boarded new subject matter expert who has been specialized in UK and   EU localizations . Consultant is knowledgeable in technology as well as local governance processes .    The questions and challenges we gathered from the business users are well documented . Those questions   are specific to how we handle <NAME> and what are the implications both from system technology as well   as the business process perspective .   We used the story telling tool for this specific country localization challenge , structured in such a way that   will be applied and discussed during our daily scrum calls .    Then we also developed a country specific template to address any such kind of issues not limited to UK   itself .   We ultimately applied the template changes into the configuration followed by system testing . There by   the business users from impacted localizations can test the system and satisfied with the approach .     Insight      We , as team learnt several insights from the business stakeholders , while implementing the country   specific loculation template . We have identified several gaps and design issues that were made as   assumptions during the initial phase of design thinking . The final out of the designed country version   template was slightly different . The business stakeholder ’s concerns were logged in “ issue log sheet ” and   considered as enhancement to the localization template . This is the way issues that were logged   translated into the add on requirements and developed the solution supported through the story telling   tool .     Approach    Since our team has already gone through several design thinking activities , the adopted approach is based   on the agile methodology . We have logged the concerns , updated them in the issue log tool , developed a   dashboard clearly visible for the business stakeholders and project management for the next course of   actions .

"Challenge & Selection 

 Upon beginning my previous job as a warehouse manager in a freight sorting facility , the entire previous   management team had left the organization . As a result , the expertise that they had left as well , leading   us to have to develop the process from the mixed freight coming in and determining the most efficient   way to sort it and ship it out in a timely manner . I immediately began visualize the process on the   whiteboard to ensure we had the process understood and mapped out . I chose visualization because in   a process flow environment with a new team , we wanted to ensure we all had the understanding of   what data was available and to be able to add to it as required . 

 Application 

 I began the process by listing out step by step the process in a process flow , from the trucks arriving to   the sorting machine , all the way to the outbound trucks . Under each step in the process , I listed out the   available details that we had at each stage in the process . We then brought in associates to interview   and understand any additional details that we could add to the process flow . 

 Once I had the process flow in place , I worked with my management team to determine the possible   ways to organize the process . Using the process flow , we ensured we used as much of the data available   before the freight arrived to group the shipments in priority groups 1 - 10 in order of fastest turnaround   available and process the freight quickly . Using this process of prioritization , we were able to take the   facility from a 55 % on time delivery rate to a 100 % on time delivery rate . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I learned from using the visualization approach and process map is that it is an extremely effective   way to implement process changes in a warehouse ( process oriented ) setting . When diagramming out a   process and all steps / information available , it allows for educated decisions to be made in a way that all   warehouse team members can feel included in . It allows for feedback to be received from both   management as well as associate levels and for all to be a part of the improvement processes . It also   allows for clear opportunity areas to be identified . 

 Since using the visualization tool , I have used it many times to implement process changes within my   sites . I truly enjoy working with teams to map out processes and work to optimize them and ensure   they ’re running in a more efficient manner .

"Challenge and selection 

 <NAME> is a useful tool that I have acquired on a daily basis because I work with many   people of different ages , adults and youth under construction , most of whom have had   economic , social , family or migration problems . Construction is hard work and is generally the   last option for many , and to forget these problems , they need support or an economic   incentive to get back on track and get ahead . That is why I have given my time this tool has   helped me to give a focus to the client . 

 Application 

 After a while there was a bit of conflict between colleagues and each time they were repeated   constantly and sometimes for insignificant things , there were even cultural clashes and all with   different design ideas , so when talking to my boss I explained how good the use can be from   storytelling the benefits it would bring for the environment and the workflow and how it   would change all the staff and how effective it would be if the group leader adopted this tool ,   then by applying people they acquired more empathy , respect for their ideas and grew   companionship . 

 <NAME> and focus 

 Well after this experience , the knowledge that I obtained by applying this tool was how   powerful storytelling can be , it can completely change people 's thinking , you gain experience   and you receive advice that will be of great help in the future and all that is something   important for someone who is interested in the course 

"
"Challenge 

 The main challenge approached by this method is to solve a problem of communication   between departments : our company ’s customer satisfaction is going under the 80 %   ( minimum acceptable ) , generally because information does n’t flow the way it should   and people from different areas ( like sales , production and quality ) do n’t know for sure   the correct schedule and dates of delivery . 

 Selection 

 The tool selected here was the learning launch , which consists of taking small   experiments testing new ideas directly in the market ( or the situation itself ) , looking for   iterative feedback to improve and learn faster from mistakes . 

 Application 

 The main solution purposed here was a digital shared platform to exchange information   between areas , with no need of e - mailing or using another mean . In the beginning , it   sounded too much places to write down the same information , so the job was kind of   repetitive . With this feedback , a sketch of another digital solution that was sharing one   e - mail address with the main subjects of information for the customers ( like delivery   dates , adjustment of quantity of requests ) was shared between all the stakeholders ,   providing quick response to customers ’ demands and providing improving satisfaction   rates . 

 Insight 

 People from different sectors ( or areas ) tend to blame others for not delivering the ideal   service and product to the customers . By starting a sharing platform , even not   completely developed with all functionalities , even the most skeptical found that   information flowed faster and we were able to act faster in response to a change of   demand or a problem found in the midway . 

 Further , the customer satisfaction with the service provided raised to levels of 90 % ,   demonstrating that with better information flow , the better the service is provided to the   customer and guaranteeing its satisfaction . 

 Approach 

 In the next approach involving different areas , a mind mapping and drawing the future   state ( visualization ) before taking those learning launch tests are going to be more   appropriate , not just because of the skepticism by the older people , that tends to stick   with their way of working and solving the problems , but also to provide a better   visualization of the future state , that might help understanding and also new ideas that   may shape even better the already going tests .

"Design Thinking 

 Feb 7 , 2016 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Design Thinking Tools used for Aspira Diagnostics Ltd 

 Background : I run a small biotech company in <ADDRESS> – ICT Center It is predominantly   focused on making diagnostic reagents . The company has a young and knowledgeable product   development team . Within a decade of its initiation , the company has established itself in the global   market as an assured source of quality material . The top diagnostic companies in the world are our   customers . However , the segment we have chosen is small and niche and there is limited scope of   expanding the business . 

 With this background , we set up an internal team to review possible options for diversification . The   obvious choice was to forward integrate and make diagnostic kits . However , this was a risky option .   One , because it meant directly competing with our existing customers and secondly the business   needed complete change of the model we had followed . The top team was not willing to jeopardize its   relations with the customers . 

 I was therefore given the responsibility of looking out for options for expanding the business . One of the   possible business option was to go a step down the value chain – to set up a Pathology Lab so that we   would not compete with our customers and in fact become their customers . Logically , this seemed the   best strategy but we knew nothing of the Pathology Lab business and there were established players in   the market . In order to develop an innovative business model and identify value preposition from the   point of the stakeholders , I used a combination of following tools – <NAME> <NAME> , Visualization and   <NAME> <NAME> . A brief of the insights obtained , points of differentiations identified and the development of   business model is provided in this note . 

 <NAME> <NAME> and Visualization : 

 I identified various stakeholders in the Pathology Lab business and mapped their journey . The diagram   overleaf provides a snapshot of that journey . I actually visited local labs and mapped this journey . From   the journey the following things were evident : 

    The patient had to spend substantial time in moving from the <ADDRESS> to the Lab several times . 

    The patient was incurring out of pocket expenses like travelling , loss of mandays etc even for   now value adding activities like collecting the samples , sharing results with Clinicians etc . 

    The results were delayed because of sample logistics and this resulted in delayed treatment . 

    I found that the cost of things like loss of mandays for self and the person accompanying the   patient , travelling costs and other out of pocket expenses were as high as the cost of testing and   treatment for routine diseases . 

    The cost of a re - test and the second iteration of this process was at least repeated once for   every patient . 

 Design Thinking 

 Feb 2 , 2017 

 I interviewed the Patients and realized that there were many different sub - groups of patients –   Pediatric , Neonatal , Elderly Patients , Working men and women , people suffering from infectious   diseases and chronic diseases etc . Each of these patient had different requirements . For example , I   made the following observations for the elderly diabetic people who need regular blood sugar testing to   be done . 

 a ) They prefer a phlebotomist to come and collect the sample from their home .   b ) Because of their age and disease they are anxious whether the phlebotomist would come on 

 time or not .

 c ) They are anxious whether the results would show a substantial increase in their blood sugar 

 level . 

 d ) If there is a little delay in the collection or in the reporting then they get irritated . 

 These insights would be extremely important in designing the logistics of sample collection as well as   dealing with such patients . 

 Insights from the use of design thinking tools : 

 The tools have provided many insights to develop a business model that meets the unmet and unstated   needs of various stakeholders . Some of these are : 

 a ) A solution needs to be developed so that the multiple trips of the patient to the clinic and labs 

 can be minimized . This will reduce cost as well as expedite the treatment available to the   patient . 

 b ) We need to clearly develop specific programs for the various patient categories . Each of them 

 have a different and unique requirement and this fact is being ignored by the existing players in   the market . 

 c ) The automation and IT systems used in the lab are disconnected . Therefore , a patient needs to 

 be registering every time in different centers of the same lab . Also , the report generated by LIS   is printed and physically delivered to the patient instead of using tools like emails , whatsapp ,   text messages etc . The clinics , the labs and the patient are not connected together through any   IT system . It is therefore necessary in the what - if and what - wow stage of this project to identify   solutions that could make this possible . 

 d ) Most of the lab focus on collecting the samples and forget to acknowledge the emotional 

 requirements of the patient in trauma . Thus , the ambience of the labs is not made comfortable   and relaxing . No lab offers counseling service to the patient . We need to identify possible   solutions and conduct a launch test in the next phase . 

 End note : The design thinking training was indeed useful to me for the assignment undertaken in my   organization . It helped me to look beyond the obvious . It made me shift my focus from me - too solutions   to a holistic solution that addressed the need of all the stakeholders . The insights obtained from the   what - is stage of this project would be useful in the subsequent phases of the project .

"Reflection .   <NAME> <NAME>   By : <NAME> <NAME> . MSc .     As we ’ve seen , the Design Thinking has a wide range of resources depending of the   type of need we have , problem we would like to solve or simply , to share an idea . So , I   have selected one of the Ideas techniques : <NAME> <NAME> .     As a professor I have used this technique in my classes , to summarize the topic .   Sometimes individually and sometimes in groups , that way , I can see how much they   can learn as it lets me evaluate the relationship of the contents of the lecture and the   readings the students had available before class .    This way , at the end of the lecture , I give my students 10 - 15 minutes to prepare their   <NAME> <NAME> letting flow all the ideas they may have and to connect them with the   readings and the other material available , when they team work , it is amazing how they   discover new ways of understanding a specific topic when they draw in the map and   the other classmates complete the ideas , sometimes we need more time as they have   discussions .    After that , the groups make a presentation of the map to the class and we try to   identify all the points in common , in this phase new discussions arise and more ideas   flow .      It is important to teach the students the difference of a Mind Map with a Concept Map :   In the Mind Map has a radial structure is less complex ( for me ) as here the student can   even formulate questions or connecting with a previous topic , while the Concept Map   has a formal structure ( as a tree ) and it ’s used mainly for organizing knowledge .      What is the response of the students ? They learned that <NAME> <NAME> help them to   study before exams and obtaining better grades as they use all the ideas expressed in   the map . This tool helps with the development   of thoughts and the flux of ideas since   they ’re using their hands to write , their minds to recover what they ’ve learned , the eyes   to see how the map is rapidly growing , and the mouth to express their own opinion .

"Design Thinking for Innovation 

 Final assignment prepared by <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> : Significantly increase sales of Healthcare IT product line in <ADDRESS> at   minimum cost and fast . 

  My goal is to increase sales of Healthcare IT product line sales in <ADDRESS> .    I need fast result and do not have budgets for marketing ... 

 Selection : of the tool to test idea 

 To overcome challenge I have idea I wanted to test . 

  I have information that up to 30 % of demo shows of Healthcare IT are finalized with 

 sales . 

  My idea is if we want to have quickly more sales at limited marketing budget – we 

 need significantly increase amount of demos and minimize cost of per 1 demo . 

 Selected tool 

  I used learning launch tool ( presented by <NAME> <NAME> at lesson 4 ) .    I selected this tool as I need fast , cheap experiment to test my Idea . 

 1 . Application of the tool : 

 First of all we created small diverse team to do experiments and discuss main ideas . Everyone   have permission to speak freely . We want minimize cost of failure . Also we agreed to mitigate   confirmation biases . 

 Here is what comes out of the discussion . 

  To minimize cost of demo we make application / show to the customer through 

 internet by Application specialist who are based in the office ( NO T&L cost ) 

  To minimize hardware cost we make Healthcare IT application demo available from 

 cloud ( No need to install , just open from customer PC at nay location in <ADDRESS> ) 

  To increase amount of demos ( grow demo funnel ) we make incentive to sales force 

 where we will pay them % new sales ( no upfront cost and payment from future   margins ) 

  Work with IT companies across <ADDRESS> who has big sales force to motivate them do 

 demos ( grow demo funnel ) 

 Then we do cost effective and fast test .The logic was to use at maximum resources and   assets already available in the company . 

  We used one workstation available in HCIT Department .    We connect workstation to service server hosted in the office .    We talked to application specialist from other departments and they agree to 

 support customer applications demo at no additional cost . 

  We collect leads from sales and partners and installed make calls to customers with 

 proposal to run demo . 

  We scheduled 10 demos during 2 weeks of time .     We have 2 sales out of 12 demos . 

 Insight 

 Applying the tool allowed to make real experiment and test idea vs real customer needs . It   helped to save huge amount of time compare to B - pan model . We have feedback from   customers and real understanding what works in this model and what could be optimized .   Cost to do this test was 20 K USD – outcome after was 63 K USD in contribution margin . 

 Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time 

 For the next time I think we will be using similar approach as cost of failure is sometimes less   then cost of time spend on creating theoretical models . In the team we have some challenges   to have all people excited to execute test – so for next time we will focus more on engagement   part – so that we have better team dynamics .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch    Challenge    I am <NAME> <NAME> , Egyptian , Teaching Assistant at Teaching Assistant at   Macmillan and Innovation Ambassador at   Ho branch according to   Communication Ministry . Our problem in <ADDRESS> is the big gap between   scientific research and practical application in the labor market . Our team   is working to try to find a solution to this serious problem .      Selection    Our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools ,   so we are ready to try the learning launch tool . Broadly speaking , the   learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea and   prototype .      Application    For our first learning launch , we focused on trying to find a way to link the   university parties and companies by obtaining a website to communicate .   For our second learning launch , we focused on the meeting between the   two parties where contact was made with the <NAME> and the   J Gs Cupcake store company in <ADDRESS> , as well as the Zurak Cancer   Foundation , and   thus our hypotheses were validated .     Insight    By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified our assumptions   and designed launches to test these assumptions . By practical experience ,   we found the companies ’ need for university research to develop their   products , but the company can not fully finance the research or purchase   the basic equipment needed for development . Through this result , the   project was modified through the introduction of an intermediary   company to finance equipment from <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> and the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> . The ongoing incorporation of insight is particularly important at   this stage , as launches come before a full rollout in the design thinking   timeline .     Approach    Our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools ,   the learning launch is the appropriate tool .

"Application of Mind Mapping tool in   Automotive domain 

 Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 I work in an Automotive R&D company . Here I mainly work on creating engine control strategies   or in other words I design how electronics integrate into our mechanical engine to make the   engine more efficient . Recently I faced an issue , the ECU ( electronic control unit , it basically tells   the engine how to operate ) was getting damaged each time I tried to start the vehicle . None of us   in my team was able to figure out the reason why , since the entire system was very complicated   and had a total of some 200 - 300 different variables involved . 

 Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and   why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture   references ) . 

 Since it was a very complex system and there were a lot of inter - dependencies between the   influencing variables I decided to use the mind mapping tool to get the complete picture of the   issue and finding it ’s root cause . Mind mapping is a highly effective and logical visual thinking   tool which can be used to showcase very complicated data in a structured manner . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what   you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 Out of the total 200 - 300 variables involved I selected 25 most influencing variables and prepared   a complete mind map capturing their inter - dependencies . I also made sure that no vital   functionality of our engine was affected . 

 The mind mapping tool was very effective for me as I was able to figure the exact route cause of   the issue ( the fuel injector was drawing in too much current ) which was responsible for the   damage to the ECU . 

 Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your   challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about   design thinking more broadly ) . 

 Initially I thought the fault was from the electrical side . But after the completion of the mind map   and the inferences that I derived from it , I found out that there was a mechanical issue with the   fuel injector due to which it was drawing in too much current . 

 Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you   selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 This was a very successful project and I was able to finish it very much before the deadline . So I   found out that mind mapping gave me a very systematic & structured thinking approach . I was 

 able to map and link together multiple variables to get an overview of my system which   uncovered some important traits about my system which I did n’t even think of before . 

"
"Challenge 

 I am a member in a volunteer work in my college , we teach classes to needy students that want to   go to college in a city in <ADDRESS> . Every year we face the same problem , studentes drop out and stop   going to class . We had tried several approaches to solve the problem but they were all useless , now   we are trying some design thinking tools to understand better the problem and fix it . We already   sent questionnaires with general questions and the main problem reported was for financial reasons . 

 Selection 

 Our team decided to apply two design thinking tools , the journey mapping and the storytelling tool ,   like in the video from the third week named by “ The MeYouHealth Story Part I : What Is ? ” , she   remember us about the Good Kitchen and how important is to explore interviewees ’ perspectives   deeper , cause like we learn on the third week : “ even one interview , if it 's a really good one , can   accomplish that inspiration ” . 

 Application 

 I have used storytelling to encourage students to be motivated in the course despite all the problems   they had at home and external problems to maintain . I told them some stories of people who   reached the limit of giving up and today are owners of large companies and influencers , in a   persuasive and captivating way the story reached a point that it was understandable to give up , but   then with courage he continued just one more time and it was enough for success .   One example I can use is about <NAME> <NAME> , he was fired from the newspaper because he did n’t   have enough creativity and good ideias , after that he bought an animation studio that went bankrupt , so he had everything to give up the dream , but he kept trying and today we see who he became .    Insight 

 By applying the storytelling tool , our team identified that is so much better to weaving together a   story rather than just making a series of points . It is a close relative of visualization another way to   make new ideas feel real and compelling . When you assume that a student is not going to class   because he is lazy or something , you are unmotivating him , s this new approach were great and   bring us a lot of new ideias to always let them motivated in class . 

 Approach 

 Using the same tool , but now with a continuous approach , every week , we take a day and in 10   minutes we set aside to listen to the students ' anxieties and then someone experienced in storytelling tells a motivating story that is somehow relative with the problem .

"Visualization 

 Background about me : 

 Completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and joined IT /IT services industry from start of my   career , I am used to deliver different roles related to technology sales , pre - sales and consulting . During   my maternity break from full time work , I did some freelancing assignments . 

 Challenge about the new role : 

 In my last freelancing assignment , I was working with brain training and development organization , as   Marketing and Sales manager . This role was very different and challenging as it required to sell and   promote a concept which in <ADDRESS> ( my region of sales ) , where lot of myths acted as road blocks . These   myths varied from perception to interpretation . For e.g. : Brain does not need any development , it is an   inborn talent people born with , <NAME> is same as meditation , few hours of training will make   permanent changes , why spend money on something which can not be quantified in terms of monetary   gain or short - term benefit , etc . 

 Other than these road blocks , my biggest challenge was to sell this concept to IT heads and CIOs of the   company , since my network comprised only technology folks . They would be my entry point to refer me   to their HR head , if they like the concept and would want their team to be trained . 

 Application : 

 Being in technology sales for long , one thing I realized during my orientation of concept itself , this concept   can not be explained with presentations and verbal communication . Technology folks only believe in   demo ’s and visual shown things only register in their brain . The importance of Visualization tool as explain   in Video of Visualization tool Week 1 , reconfirms the need for same . 

 Firstly , I had to think of something which will grab their attention at very first instance , secondly it must   be engaging more than mere watching , thirdly they need to have firsthand experience or proof of concept   with case studies . Most of all the new method must be truly innovative for them to believe the brain   training is truly working for me and I am able to think out of the box . 

 After , doing multiple rounds of iteration , I designed a brain puzzle . This puzzle is given to the CIO ’s to solve   and put the pieces together . On completion of puzzle it will form a human brain and explain what part of   brain develops and how it benefits to the Humans . There is a second set of puzzles which I put together   to explain the method in which brain training works . 

 Attached is the image of Adult brain and its benefits after training . ( The Prefrontal cortex of the brain   increases physically after the training which helps enhance the primary and secondary skills sets which in   turn helps to develop complex skill sets like leadership and out - of - the - box thinking ) 

 Attached is the image of 4 - R strategy which is used to train the brain . ( Realize what you are in be in present   moment , create Anchors be in present moment on demand , rewire your new pathways ( thought patterns )   and redesign your new automations to succeed ) 

 Learning & Benefits : 

 This helped me to grab the attention and easily get the next level of meeting to their HR managers . Also ,   it helped them to take a break from their routine automation of looking at presentations and videos , by   physically engaging in the presentation and giving inputs . It is very much necessary for us to ensure the 

 listener gets the message which we want to deliver and at same time do validation whether our offering   will help them . 

 While making many people solve the simple puzzle more than 50 % of people took more than 10mins , and   35 % could finish only by giving some assistance . Only 5 % of people could solve the puzzle with in 5mins   by themselves . 

 This clearly shows even with 20 + years of experience , brain does need some training to think out - of - the- box and routine to solve new problems . 

 Alternate method : 

 After , going through the course of Design thinking innovation , it has helped me to open up new ways of   methodologically thinking new and different methods for being more effective in my work . With   visualization tool , <NAME> telling tool also needs to be very effective and need to concentrate on both well .   <NAME> <NAME> method can help me to start small pilots for sample groups , create success stories and then   expand to overall organizations .

 DESIGN THINKING TOOL 

 VISUALISATION 

 1 | P a g e 

 DESIGN THINKING TOOL : VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGES AND SELECTION 

 Visualization is a technique for creating images , diagrams , or animations to communicate a 

 message . Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate 

 both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man . It is the first design thinking tool 

 used in this course . 

 It is a core component of the way that we communicate , whether we are aware of it or not . 

 When we are dealing with very complex problems , we are actually enacting a different kind 

 of problem . Visualization is really important in all fields and especially for the process of 

 design as it is a way of unlocking a different part of brain . It allows us to think in a nonverbal 

 way .   Visualization allows us to access parts of our brain , parts of our creativity , that we 

 might not normally be using in our conversation . Most people will tell you , especially those 

 who are in the field of management i.e from business world , that they are not artistic and 

 they can not draw . Visualization is n't really about drawing   , though . It 's actually about visual 

 thinking . 

 When we move on into pattern finding , that 's where we start to think visually . When we get 

 to concept development or designing something visualization becomes incredibly key . 

 Because concepts are literally coming out of our imagination . And our brain is creating 

 pictures of something that does n't yet exist . 

 APPLICATION 

 Visualization and expressing data is very mandatory thing to do while you represent your 

 idea . It is very important for the user to know what exactly you want to express . Visualization 

 today has ever - expanding applications in science , education , engineering ( e.g. , product 

 visualization ) , interactive multimedia , medicine , etc . Typical of a visualization application is 

 the field of computer graphics . The invention of computer graphics may be the most 

 important development in visualization since the invention of central perspective in 

 the Renaissance period . The development of animation also helped advance visualization . 

 2 | P a g e 

 The use of visual representations to transfer knowledge between at least two persons aims 

 to improve the transfer of knowledge by using computer and non - computer - based 

 visualization   methods   complementarily .   Examples   of   such   visual   formats 

 are sketches , diagrams , images , objects , interactive visualizations , information visualization 

 applications , and imaginary visualizations as in stories . While information visualization 

 concentrates on the use of computer - supported tools to derive new insights , knowledge 

 visualization focuses on transferring insights and creating new knowledge in groups . Beyond 

 the mere transfer of facts , knowledge visualization aims to further transfer insights , 

 experiences , attitudes , values , expectations , perspectives , opinions , and predictions by using 

 various complementary visualizations . 

 The use of visualization to present information is not a new phenomenon . It has been used 

 in maps , scientific drawings , and data plots for over a thousand years . Being in the field of 

 architecture we have to think a lot about our designs like how its façade will look ? , will the 

 plan work ? , if the design fulfill client need ? And lot more . First of all we imagine how our 

 building design is going to be if that design is not possible we still   think of making it working . 

 This is known as Creative visualization . 

 Creative visualization , which is a mental technique that uses the imagination to make dreams 

 and goals come true . Used in the right way , creative visualization can improve your life and 

 attract to you success and prosperity . It is a power that can alter your environment and 

 circumstances , cause events to happen , and attract money , possessions , work , people and 

 love into your life . Creative visualization uses the power of the mind , and is the power behind 

 every success . By visualizing a certain event , situation , or an object , you attract it into our 

 life . It is a process that is similar to daydreaming . For some people , this might look like magic , 

 but there is no magic involved , only the natural process of the power of thoughts and natural 

 mental laws . Visualization helped to visualize abstract forms of data such as directory or file 

 structures on a computer , the information content of books , hyper - text documents on the 

 web or other forms of abstract data i.e while thinking about some concept a blurred image is 

 formed in our minds which gives us an idea and helps to develop our concept . 

 We might utilize photographs at that point to make sure that we understand what the 

 concept is like . As we move forward into prototyping , we get much more detailed in the way 

 3 | P a g e 

 that we start to visualize . Then we create very complex diagrams , or maps of how we think 

 the customer experience ideally is going to work . As we have to design for client we have to 

 think like our client and before designing anything we have to know about client ’s 

 requirements . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 What I have learned from this is that <NAME> and images enable us to not only 

 help people understand what it is we 're trying to do , but to help really persuade them in the 

 worthiness of , that particular idea , or , the strength of , of that concept . So on the off chance 

 that I was presenting another administration and I was really depending on various 

 individuals in the field to , to have the capacity to convey this , this support of an arrangement 

 of clients . They have to see precisely how I expect this to function and I may utilize story 

 sheets , I may attempt to make visual situations . However , they have to comprehend what it 

 is we 're attempting to do as such that they can really make a powerful testing environment 

 for that thought . The exhortation I would provide for agents who were keen on enhancing 

 their perception abilities would be instantly , just to rehearse . It 's the sort of thing where once 

 you start to utilize the ability . What 's more , it can be a bit of scaring at first . In any case , I feel 

 that individuals will find that once they begin getting in the propensity for doing that , you 

 rapidly perceive how whatever remains of the room reacts to you when you get up and you 

 begin drawing . 

 I observed that the most valuable aspect is the shared insight and learning , in future also I 

 would prefer using this design thinking tool . As it makes easier to understand design 

 problems .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a designer to create an innovative product , I often use mind mapping tools . Mind mapping allows   me to know what innovation products I will research and detailed information about the products I   design and know what the real needs of users are . As long as I use mind mapping , I am always helped to   find what is best for me too design . 

 Application 

 In every innovation design , mind mapping is always my mainstay . Before making a mind map , I had to   do a face - to - face interview or an interview via google form . I interview at least 10 people and usually   always more for more accurate results . The goal is to find out firsthand what users think , as well as   complaints and needs . 

 On google forms 

 The mind mapping that I usually use is a bit different from the explanation video . But there are also   similarities . The mind mapping that I use consists of 5 parts of questions , namely : who , what , why ,   when , why , and how . each answer will be on the respective chart based on the question chart . 

 Who is determining what kind of users need product innovation . What is describing what kind of   product and innovation is required in every detail . Why is to describe the problem and why this product   design is needed , why this innovation is designed like this and all possible reasons for the design . When   is information about when this product is used . where is a description of where this product will work   and all the possibilities . How is an explanation of how this product works . 

 Insights & Approach 

 What I learned from the application of mind mapping is that I get clearer and grouped results . Mind   mapping helps me have a clear picture that is easy to communicate . So that mind mapping becomes my   main reference in making the product to be designed . For future designs I will still use this and add   methods to videos , videos open my mind about involving more users in the project .

"Challenge 

 Storytelling is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of situations in our daily lives ; as a result , it is   a technique that I use frequently . As a shampoo marketer , I was constantly faced with the problem of   attracting more people to test and fall in love with our newly launched goods . In addition , I was   confronted with the problem of how to combat the phenomenon of declining brand loyalty to our   products . As a result of the numerous options available to clients in today ’s markets , this has occurred . 

 I use storytelling because it allows me to gain insight into users , build empathy , and emotionally connect   with them . I frequently create personas to represent target users , and I use conflict in stories to reflect   their user journeys and problems . One reason is that telling stories allows us to better understand what   users expect from a solution . Audiences are always captivated by good stories . If designers employ   narrative throughout the design process in user experience ( UX ) design , they may ensure that all work is   focused on the users ’ needs and the value that the organisation wants to provide those customers . You   use your insights to tell a storey about your users ’ needs and desires after performing design study to   understand their requirements and goals . 

 Emotional branding is a side effect of storytelling . Emotional branding is the art of creating brands that   appeal directly to the self , emotional state , wants , and goals of consumers . The goal of emotional   branding is to create a bond between customers and products by appealing to their emotions . Love ,   power , emotional stability , and self - satisfaction are all subconscious requirements that allow marketers   to generate self - fulfilling prophecies in customer demand . People expect their needs to be met , and   advertising must supply these demands on a continuous basis . Our firm has created a new anti - dandruff   treatment shampoo product line that allows real women to share their product experiences in the   “ Beauty Me Anti Dandruff Diary , ” which includes videos and a blog where real women discuss their hair   dandruff stories and how new products might help . Real women from fashion bloggers , travel bloggers ,   beauty artists , and other backgrounds are drawn to a YouTube - designed diary channel to share their   anti - dandruff stories with us . There is also a link to purchase things online . The channel also spawned a   Facebook app that was supposed to function as a diary once more . The Secret Diary app , in addition to   similar YouTube channels , provides extra information about hair and productsThere is also a link to   purchase things online . The channel also spawned a Facebook app that was supposed to function as a   diary once more . The Secret Diary app , in addition to similar YouTube channels , provides extra   information about hair and products . The two foundations of the sport are supported by creating a   hidden diary , disclosing items as a remedy , and allowing actual women to share their anti - dandruff   secrets . As a result of the actual and high credibility of the review , new consumers are more willing to   embark on their adventure with our products 

 Insight 

 We designed and tested our solutions using the learning tool . We were able to improve the function and   design of our product as a result of the learning process in order to satisfy user expectations . We   discovered that customers were more drawn to the Facebook review because it was shared by ordinary   people rather than celebrities or influencers . The outcomes of this procedure were utilised by our   marketing staff to re - strategize our marketing campaign . To improve our product and services , our   company will focus on human - centered design in the future .

"1 . Visualization 

 Elements : 

 1 . Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I am using is Visualization . Part of our Human factors course is a game wherein a team   consisting of 5 members each will try to replicate a model aircraft . This activity will demonstrate   process of defining scope of work , teamwork and relationships . 

 2 . Application : There will be 3 groups . Each team will replicate a model aircraft using legos   provided . However , there will be no instructions on how they will make their aircraft . The aircraft   model will be displayed to the 3 teams for a full 1 minute . The team will start to build the model   aircraft . Another chance will be given to each team member to peek at the model aircraft for 10   seconds . They can not take picture or can not touch the aircraft model . How they will replicate to   build the aircraft will be based on their memory on what they saw on that 10 seconds . 

 3 . Insight & Approach : As the team tries to replicate the model aircraft , I have learned from   conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the they try to build the models , each   one will have a different idea as per the memory of the visualization he has , incorporates their   own feedback , shared insights and shared learning that occurs . While they ended up creating   models far different from the actual piece that they were trying to create , teamwork and   camaraderie was present and gave a focal point for discussion about working relationships .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am a university student and co - founder of a startup that works as a platform   that intermediates negotiations between customers and service providers in a   fast , practical and safe way , and our challenge is to grow in the Brazilian service   contracting market while we innovate in the business model to differentiate   ourselves from the existing services . Our project is focused on innovating in the   three main pillars of this market segment , the fee charged by the existing   platforms , the way in which negotiations are carried out between the customer   and the service provider and the ease of contracting services . Our team   consists of four people divided into three sectors : marketing , customer relations   and development . Due to the Coronavirus crisis , we are also facing the   challenge of attracting investors via online pitch presentations . 

 Selection 

 Our project went through all the stages of design thinking and we are now   working with the learning launch tool , which consists of small , well - crafted   prototypes to achieve a quick and cheap validation of the potential market on   the prototype made and thus obtaining accurate feedbacks on the updates that   we launched . 

 Application 

 Making a platform and a website takes a lot of money , that 's why we created an   Instagram account to be our MVP ( minimum viable product ) that is being used   as a means of validating our idea , to do the marketing and promotion of our   project and also as a temporary business platform while our official platform is   not ready . We post content related to our project twice a week and get feedback   from the comments made on the posts and forms that we post on Stories to   know exactly what pleases our target audience . In addition to posts about our   project we also post extra content and tips for people to be able to do simple   things on their own instead of having to hire a professional , we also post   content on home decor and professional training tips for our service providers   so that they stand out in the market . 

 Insight 

 After applying the learning launch tool , we had insights that we were not   imagining . We did our project thinking about a younger audience , between 18- 30 years old , who lives with their parents , friends or alone , but after the   feedbacks we received we realized that our majority audience consists of   people between 35 - 60 years old and for that reason we had to readapt our way   of communicating with an audience since the approach to the younger audience   is very different from the approach to the older audience . We also realized that   one of the most important functions of our business , communication between   the customer and the service provider , was not pleasing the public and our 

 entire development team focused on this area before continuing with the rest of   the project . 

 Approach 

 Considering the results obtained through design thinking and especially the   learning launch tool , it is very likely that we will use this methodology more often   since it is excellent for feedbacks and new insights that are only possible to   have listening to our customers .

 While we are not aware , we have been seeing how “ storytelling ” affects corporate ’s valuation in 

 stock markets . I work for an investment bank as a private banker in wealth management department . 

 I deal with all securities like shares , bonds and funds with both individuals and corporates . As <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> says in our video lecture ; “ storytelling is a fundamental part of every great brand making 

 that product live everyday ” , in same way , it is directly affected in corporation ’s valuation . Because 

 unlike bond , markets stock markets are more looking forward to the future , it could be important 

 to understand the power of storytelling in stock markets . Thus , I checked out case study of mine 

 and discussed with my colleagues about this topic . 

 Application & Insight 

 Last year , I invested in Grace Hill Health Centers into my stock product I am managing . At that time , it took times to 

 decide to put the stock into my portfolio , because the company was overvalued for almost 8 times 

 in terms of PSR(market cap / total revenue ) , compared to other auto makers . But I decided to believe 

 in their potential plans and growth rate . Now that I think about it , the most important factor to 

 make me invest was not only their growth , plans nor technologies but also their promising fancy 

 stories . The reason I came to this conclusion is that I sold it all last month and the reason why I 

 sold it all was The CEO of the company is breaking trust of stakeholder who are both customers 

 and investors . While he is , In these days , talking alt - coins in front and back perspective , he is losing 

 trust and the price of stock is going down . I have discussed about this topic with 10 colleagues 

 who have or had invested in Grace Hill Health Centers . Of course , there are many other variables like macro wave and 

 industrial money movement . However , all of my colleagues I discussed agree with this hypothesis , 

 “ the lower trust of storytelling , the lower valuation of corporate in financial markets . ”   So , even if 

 it could be small impact , promising storytelling is likely change on corporate valuation . Although , 

 the consensus of fiscal fundamental is not changed . 

 Approach 

 Then , how evaluate the valuation of storytelling ? Unfortunately , there would be no way to solve this 

 question clearly . However , we can set up some criteria to use this wonderful tools . Because there is 

 a big possibility that the power of storytelling is been affecting behave of people and corporate 

 growth in a good way , we allow some part if the criteria we have created is not undermined . The 

 criteria are new creative view of fundamental valuation like PSG(PSR / sales growth ) and trust of the 

 storytelling . No matter how storytelling is good , it could be better not to invest in too overestimated 

 stocks . If it overs our very generous criteria , there would be more dangerous than good . Also , we 

 do not forget good storytelling is pumping up corporate valuation . Therefore , if it is damaged , we 

 should act in accordance with it . 

 This section allows me think my industry again . It makes me abandon narrow and comfortable mind , 

 build broad repertoire and start looking for new experiences . From tomorrow I will looking forward 

 to find new opportunity .

"Reflection 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> , Analysis and Selection 

 The challenge I have chosen to create this reflection is a personal problem , which   consists of the following : Due to the sanitary and economic crisis generated by the   covid-19 , me and my family have had to move to a municipality called <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> de <ADDRESS> , located in the department of <ADDRESS> in <ADDRESS> ; This year   I have been admitted to the National Ankara University , in Manizales campus ,   and in turn to the Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering , in Honda campus 

 This caused me to study two careers at the same time , and due to the action of the   government to return to normality , it has generated a problem to move to one of   the two cities to continue my studies in person , or as a second option to move to   the city of <ADDRESS> to continue my educational process in that city . 

 The factors that are strongly connected to the problem are : The distance between   both universities , Low amount of economic resources for the support in any of the   two cities , The short time to return to receive face - to - face classes . 

 The problem has several aspects to observe , both positive and negative of each   option mentioned above . 

 Advantages and disadvantages 

 Advantages of the Manizales option : 

 - It would not require a major relocation . 

 - It is a more economical city 

 - It has great housing offers for students 

 - Manizales is a safe and quiet city 

 Disadvantages of the Manizales option : 

 - Need to travel every weekend to receive classes in Honda ( approximately 4 hours   of travel time ) 

 - It is a new city where everything is unknown 

 - It does not have good job opportunities for students 

 Advantages of the <NAME> option : 

 - It does not require travel to another city to attend classes at both universities . 

 - It is a city that I know , and I know how it works 

 - It has good job opportunities for students 

 - I have family currently living in that city , who can support me . 

 Disadvantages of the <NAME> option : 

 - Despite having ample opportunities for student housing , they can be expensive . 

 -It is a busy and unsafe city . 

 - Requires a large relocation 

 Selection 

 Thanks to the knowledge acquired throughout the Design Thinking course , I have   found the possibility of a solution through the Learning launch tool , since it allows   me to see the different perspectives of both options firsthand , without influencing   the educational process in a significant way . 

 The Learning launch tool allows me to see every aspect of each option   respectively , creating an action plan , thus facilitating the decision - making process   on my part . The Learning Launch tool allows the entrepreneur , entrepreneur or   manager to act on situations through experimentation and is the best way to decide   which option is best for me . 

 Insight 

 By raising this idea in the challenge in question , the points from which the problem   can be seen were applied , not only from the educational point of view , but from   economic , family , work and other perspectives related to the human being , the   application of this idea opened the panorama to show all the opportunities and the   different factors that surround and influence the problem . 

 The idea of learning through experimentation is applied to this problem generates   an action plan based on 3 main factors to decide following an action plan which is : 

 1 ) Attend Manizales for the first half of the second semester of the year 2021 . 

 2 ) Travel to <ADDRESS> in the vacation time of the semester mentioned above to see   the possibilities of housing and support . 

 3 ) To make a comparison of what was the best experience and the option with   which I feel more secure . 

 The 3 factors to generate a decision are : 

 1 ) Employability 

 2 ) Affordable or moderate housing 

 3 ) Low food and transportation costs 

 Approach 

 Following the same path of the Learning launch , the possibilities of change are   almost infinite , since it is based on experimentation and each situation is presented   in a different and unique way , so it is a versatile tool that allows you to generate   different action plans , this quickly and effectively , however it is a double - edged   sword , since being a tool that allows you to experiment generates a high possibility   of failure , due to the same risk that the tool generates , the next time I would use a   tool such as visualization or mind mapping , since it allows to see in a more graphic   way the possible results .

"Challenge : 

 I am a final year undergraduate student spearheading the Innovation Cell in our University . As a   part of it , we focus on pro bono innovation consultancy in the quest for Grassroot and Frugal   innovations across the state . Our challenge is to streamline our innovation space towards potent   and prolific projects by adapting existing useful technologies to find and develop new needed   technologies . We will try to focus on improving our workflow by circumscribing our scope while   reducing uncertainties in the process . 

 Selection : 

 We are selecting the Learning launch tool in this approach as it is best suited for our purpose to   quickly experiment with ideas , validate assumptions and assess deterministic failures .   Quantitative parameters and optimum target markets can not be studied or forecasted with much   certitude at the start of the Innovation process . 

 Application : 

 In our first onus , we focused on the edifice of identifying problems . We tried to achieve a holy   grail of specificity in defining our problem statements . It tested our assumption of workflow , that   we were spending superfluous time and effort on a vast problem .   We used an ultimate Root   Cause Analysis Tool – “ Five Why s ” which is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore   the cause - and - effect relationships . Each answer forms the basis of the next question . We   expected to come up with well - defined meticulous problem statements that clearly indicates   User type , emotional quotient , quantifiable impact and shortcomings . 

 In our second onus , we focused on our processes of <ADDRESS> brainstorming and <ADDRESS> appraisal .   This tested our assumption of workflow that we were creating redundant projects and following   imprudent viability scrutiny . We used the M - I - T model of experimental learning which explains   the ever - iterative innovation process and Market , Implementation , Technology ( M - I - T ) as its   three pillars . Deviating from linear - funnel models and false dichotomies helped us validate   assumption and reduce variables . 

 Insight : 

 The learning launch tool supplemented our process of abstraction , enhanced the initial feasibility   assessments and helped in prioritization of tasks . It also helped us with the epiphany of   intellectual honesty by the ability to face the Physical realm and Human realm instead of   suspending the reality . We gained insight through direct transactional experiences . It helped us   solicit genuine feedback for our projects instead of speculation and resolve uncertainty with   minimum commitment of resources . 

 Approach : 

 The learning launch is a pertinent tool as it not only augmented our workflow but also curtailed   losses . There were often setbacks such as irrelevant ideas and incorrect market research ,   however this approach helped us with sequential failure with lessening severity . Visual aids and   graphics can also be incorporated in this process for developing key insights and sharing   perspectives .

"<NAME> <NAME> <NAME> – Learning launch 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I was appointed to assist the Management to get an IT project back to the track . The project aims to   deliver an IT tool to support financing activity for several business lines in many regions involving 43   countries . The project has been started 3 years ago , and by now , is entering a crisis mode as the team is   struggling to deliver and finalise the project . The costs are steadily growing , and the end date is   uncertain . The project partially delivered some functionalities . The end - users are not satisfied and are   reluctant to adopt the new tool , they keep using manual processes or existing tools that are supposed to   be decommissioned . My role is to identify and implement a solution to get out of this situation . 

 Based on the preliminary discussions with various stakeholders , it was obvious that the project suffers   from "" tunnel effects "" and end - users un - satisfaction , I decide to use the learning launch as it will bring   visibility to the users . They can see quickly what the tool looks like and they interact with IT team . 

 Application 

 The starting point was to identify the roots of the crisis , what is behind the "" tunnel effect "" and the un- satisfaction of users . Based on "" what is "" technics : first , I gathered all data available on the project   documentation . Second , I prepared 3 types of interviews forms , one for the project team , one for the   end - users ( clients ) and one for the management . 

 The "" what is "" phase allowed to find out the following root causes : 

 1- The requirements have been amended several times , the project team adjusted the roadmap 

 involving costs increase and planning extensions 

 2- The end users ( clients ) are not appropriately represented in the project governance , some 

 business lines are absent , so their needs are not captured 

 3- The tool reached a degree of complexity that any change requires significant time and money 

 Then , we organised an offsite ( 1 day ) involving project team managers and end - user 's representatives .   It was the first time in 3 years that all stakeholders are gathered . We discussed the main findings of the   previous phase and asked each stakeholder to envisage what will be the ideal tool for him . The main   outcomes : 

 ( a ) the end - users want visibility ( no tunnel effect ) and simplicity ( break complexity )   ( b ) the project team wants stable requirements committed by all business lines 

 The decision was made to build a learning launch initiative in 2 months ' time . The initiative was   conducted by a core representative team including IT , end users and operations . A set of common   requirements was established and committed . The objective was to implement a tool for financing files   validated at local level . To break complexity factors , the tool will serve 2 main functionalities :   documents storage and files status management . 

 The IT platform was replaced by an "" on the shelf IT tool "" to minimise customisation . The working mode   was also changed to involve Agile interactions and strong governance . 

 A business line present in 2 countries was chosen to use the new tool for their financing activity . They   were satisfied by the new tool . The users find the tool user friendly , they divide their file processing   time by 2 and they are able to know the financing file status with one click . 

 Insight & approach 

 Two elements are key in this approach , ( 1 ) gathering all stakeholders and making them discuss and share   the problems and the solutions , ( 2 ) adopting the learning launch showing concrete results reinsuring the   end - users and bringing confidence to IT team . 

 All these elements were used to build a case for change and propose the abandon of the old project and   start a new project with a roadmap of 12 months and a reasonable budget . The roadmap was based on   the scale up of the 2 main functionalities built in the learning launch , split in 2 waves and 2 deliveries   each 6 months . A pragmatic approach was introduced to manage perimeter changes : any add on should   be coupled with a take off a lower priority feature . So , the waves weight will remain stable to keep the   budget and planning on the track . 

 The case for change was validated by the high - level management and the new project was started by   scaling up the learning launch tool .

"Storytelling    Challenge   In my position as sales representative of one logistics company I worked with customers   which were sceptical about whether a logistics company could ever meet their speciﬁc   needs in setting up a reliable supply chain for their products . My customers were   Biotechnology and <NAME> companies , which created unique treatments from cellular   material from one patient at a time . This medicine could be given to this patient only after   long manufacturing period . The treatments were high price , highly sensitive to any kind of   transport damages and mishandling and not easily replaceable . If such medication would   be damaged during the transport , the consequences for the patient would be crucial ,   starting from permanent health damages to death . In such situation also the reputation of   the <ADDRESS> companies would suﬀer .   Usually scientists were my contact persons and decision makers within such companies ,   who were not familiar in depth with logistics processes . To go even deeper , there was a   low level of trust between the service provider and the customer . So my challenge was to   ﬁnd a common emotional base and create trust with the main decision makers instead of   confusing the scientists with complicated logistics terms and communicating standard   sales pitches . The goal of the meetings was to ﬁnd a common ground for cooperation   with the customer , which would result in the development of a customer centric logistics   solution . 

 Selection   In order to create an emotional connection and have a trust base with my customers I   often used the technique of storytelling . This technique enables the narrator to transfer   emotions and draw pictures in the mind of the listener . Images and emotions used in this   approach last long beyond the meeting boundaries and lead to an emotional connection   between listener , narrator and also to the company . An additional advantage for this tool   is that no assets are necessary despite a common language with the customer . Especially   when visiting the customer for the ﬁrst time , you do n’t want to bring unrest into the   meeting by asking for a whiteboard that is not in the meeting room as this might be   necessary for the visualisation tool . 

 Application The emotion I wanted to establish during each meeting was that I ’m „ one of them “ . Being   a scientist from training myself , I often used to tell a story of how I had to transport of   analytical samples between the lab I was working and analytical laboratory , which was   our corporation partner .   The samples looked , for those who do n’t know , like small volumes of water , stored in 96   tiny vials . For those who knew , they contained several weeks of hard laboratory work and   many emotional ups and downs . I knew , that while the shipment was valuable for me , a   standard courier would not waste additional attention on it . After spending several weeks   on creating the samples , I could not imagine to hand over my “ babies ” to anyone who   would not handle them the way I would do it . So after spending a lot of energy on ﬁnding   an appropriate transport solution and company , I decided to transport the samples as a   hand carry myself .   At this point the customers already understood that we spoke in a common language and   was thrilled to hear the end of the conclusion . Also for them , the medication they worked   on for several weeks in the lab felt like own children . My last sentences of the story were that after such an experience I decided to switch the   sites and to help scientist to gain trust in the logistics wold , especially by representing the 

 customers interests in the company I was working . Not every scientist would be able to   leave their working environment for one or several days to transfer the medicine to the   patient , but still wants to have a feeling of control and trust , like he or she would have   done it himself . So this would be my job , to make their needs being transferred into   transport solutions . 

 Insights and approach From my experience the technique of storytelling provides a possibility to create a long   lasting connection between sceptical customer and the sales representative without the   need of long presentations or usage of empty sales phrases . By staying authentical , I was   able to   establish stable relationships to the decision makers and gain their trust to go the   next steps with me and the company I was representing .   I will use storytelling in my future projects of design thinking and possibly combine it with   the the tool of visualisation , dependent on the project . My main focus in the near future   will be to sharpen my abilities in usage of the tool beyond the information provided by this   course and to gain more theoretical knowledge of how to structure and compose the   story .

"THE LAWYER STUDENT COMPLICATIONS 

 I am <NAME> <NAME> , a <NAME> <NAME> in the Kenyon College and I have to use the online marketing department and 

 my / our challenge is to improve the workflow , within the group of my class in order to 

 increase sales in the online channel and to spend marketing budgets on the right 

 campaigns . The project scope includes the online marketing department composed of ten 

 employees , as well as the larger marketing department and IT department , with whom we 

 work closely . The project is limited to internal resources ( i.e. , budget and employee time ) . 

 The project should not excees business days and the solution should include an even 

 distribution of working hours amongst the team members . We will focus on trying to 

 uncover what our team members , as well as key stakeholders within the larger marketing 

 department and IT department , consider to be ineffective or problematic with regard to 

 the workflow . 

 When we Selection Our team has already gone through several design thinking 

 activities / tools , so we are ready to try the learning launch tool . Broadly speaking , the 

 learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea and prototype . Application 

 For our first learning launch , we focused on the structure / execution of our online 

 marketing tasks . In particular , we wanted to see if we could structure our tasks , projects , 

 and processes to adapt the methods of Scrum project management for our work ( e.g. , time 

 boxed , daily , specific meetings , reviews , etc . ) in an effort to become more agile . This 

 tested our assumption that the structure and execution were the main causes of our 

 workflow challenge . Our team went through a two - day training with a Scrum project 

 management coach . Next , we went through five workshops to structure our tasks and 

 processes in a more agile way . These two sessions occurred within in a three - week 

 timeframe . We expected to produce a document with a clear description of our new , more 

 agile processes / workflow . For our second learning launch , we focused on gaining clarity 

 about our tasks and priorities . 

 This tested our assumption that our prioritization of tasks was the main cause of 

 our workflow challenge and the principal carateristics of the law in <ADDRESS> . Our team 

 completed an anonymous survey . Additionally , five key stakeholders from the larger 

 marketing department and IT department also completed an anonymous survey . The 

 surveys included questions about our new , proposed process , understanding the process 

 and the prioritization of tasks , and feelings about the change , and were conducted within 

 a one - week timeframe . Insight By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified 

 our assumptions and designed launches to test these assumptions . Additionally , we 

 thought through anticipated results , expecting to find that a more agile approach would 

 improve our workflow , and that both our team and the key stakeholders would be fairly 

 open to the new prioritization of tasks and process . Our actual results were slightly 

 different from what we anticipated : while our team was open to the prioritization of tasks 

 and process , the key stakeholders in the larger marketing department and IT department 

 expressed some concerns . Moving forward , our team will review this insight and 

 incorporate it into future launch designs . 

 The ongoing incorporation of insight and law , is particularly important at this 

 stage , as launches come before a full rollout in the design thinking timeline . Approach 

 Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools and 

 are at this stage in the timeline , the learning launch is the appropriate tool . As previously 

 mentioned , our team needs to review the insight gained from our first two launches and 

 incorporate this insight into future launch designs . Future launch designs should reflect 

 insight gained , progress made , and come closer to a compelling solution ready for full 

 rollout .

"Challenge :    Working to champion a number of innovative ICT based solutions to tackle gender based violence , I was   tasked to achieve the unison among a myriad of stakeholders to select some of distinctly themed ideas for   learn launching .     Selection :   The first tool that I used was mind mapping . The tool inevitability links up with visual thinking . It is always   better than using words when brainstorming , asking questions and connecting ideas . Mind mapping makes   visual thinking come alive , that is why I chose it . The tool also allows a smooth fusion of other great design   thinking tools ; I was able to fuse in ethnography via storytelling , and journey mapping .     It starts with a single idea that is represented with text , colour or image . Each idea presented with one single   word or any visual elements to categorize it . More subsidiary ideas are added around the main idea and   interconnected by lines . Unified hierarchy styles are then able to be easily implemented through the mind   map .      Application :    During the brainstorming meetings we had held with developers about the general problem of GBV , many   outputs were shared and presented in fractals . These ideas were prepared into a portfolio of napkin pitches .   The intent was to allow for co creation by joining a two dozen team representing diverse demographics and   introduce them to this portfolio in order to champion the best ideas for prototyping and eventually learn   launching .   The stakeholder team was given some homework that involved them reflecting about some of   their GBV experiences to prepare them for a story telling session later on .     We organised a simple exhibition for the stakeholders . This was without much attention to how the   exhibition ’s physical set up would influence the human engagement . We did brief the exhibitors on how to   interact with the stakeholders without imposing their ideas . We allowed our stakeholders to wander   through the exhibition at their own pace and pick out the ideas that mostly appeal to them and note them   on separate sticky notes . We also asked them to pick out what they felt would not work at all ; the outliers .   After an hour , we moved into a workshop space for sharing . Each team member was asked to speak about   their experience with any form of GBV and how they think that one of the ideas exhibited here today would   have helped them in one way or another . Each participant would then centre their story in a pin wheel   putting the idea that works in the upper half and one that would not in the lower half . They then scored out   of ten the capability of the exhibited idea if it was present during their experience . By clustering people ’s   stories by similar themes , we found that the same kinds of stories had a tendency to choose a similar class of   solutions . The outliers turned out to be ideas that integrated a number of themes . We were able to choose   the best five ideas , and even suggest some changes whilst designing their low fidelity prototype . I look   forward to the launch learning process .     Insight and future approaches :    I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would use the   visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised graphic that   incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the remainder of their work .   In the future , it is very important to avail more time and resources to plan out the entire process especially   the story telling session with the developers and the setup of the exhibition will be geared to increase   stakeholder engagement and learning by creating more comfort , applying planned spontaneity and strategic   guest host relationships .

"Solutions against coronavirus using Mind 

 Mapping 

 1 . Challenge & Selection 

 During the last few weeks , I participated in the local coronavirus taskforce witch has a preventive and a curative 

 mission as the virus is spreading very fast word wide . 

 A lot of stakeholders are concerned by this mission , doctors , government , volunteers , media and more ; and the 

 first priority was to develop a better understanding of the current reality . That is the reason why I suggested the 

 mind mapping tool as we need to maximize the communication quality of all kinds of data and insights and make 

 them as easier as possible to communicate between all the stakeholders 

 And as we know , the mind mapping tool is the best alternative to develop a common mind regarding the current   reality of the situation we are dealing with . 

 2 . Application 

 Given the current context and to guarantee the safety of participants , we used online tools to collect ideas , gather   data and feedbacks and event to discuss and collaborate . 

 To do that , we used : 

 ● Google Drive for document and forms 

 ● MindMeister to create collaborative <NAME> <NAME> 

 ● <NAME> for videoconference 

 As a start , we created a Google form document with a full description of the problem , we asked few questions to   know the person who is answering our questions : name , phone number , gender , age , email address , questions to   measure the level of understanding of the actual problem and finally their suggestions or ideas to solve the   problem . 

 After 24 hours , we used to answers we collected to : 

 1 . Define the directions we should take by defining the branches of the mindmap that represent the most   important areas about our central topic . 

 Branches of the​ Solutions gainst Coronavirus​ mind map 

 2 . Define the workgroups of more or less 20 participants based on the contributor ’s profiles . For that , we   made sure to represent all types of profiles in groups based on the area of interest , age , gender , etc . 

 An example of a Zoom call for a groupwork 

 We assigned a facilitator for every workgroup witch the mission was basically to fluid the communication between   the team . 

 We assigned a branch for each team with a mission to expand it to subbranches and then to elaborate and grow   the sub - branches during 5 meetings , 40 minutes each . 

 We set some small rules : 

 ● Use single keywords rather than long text to help focus on one single idea per branch or sub - branch and   simplify the topic as much as possible . 

 ● Use legible and clear words in order to make it easier for the other participants or the teams to read it . 

 ● Use visual elements such as colors , shapes and icons to represent ideas 

 Elaborating a sub - branch 

 3 . Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that mind mapping is one of the most 

 efficient methods that help to ​organize ideas for ​more understanding of the situations through breaking things 

 down into smaller parts ; ​divide and conquer , as they say​. 

 The mind map graphic gives the different teams a better understanding of the central topic witch help them to 

 share their perspectives and develop common solution or suggestion built on the base of the sum of the 

 intelligence of the workgroup . 

 Conducting this exercise helped me develop my understand of the use of the mind map tool . It also gave me the 

 idea that it can be used in collaboration with other design thinking tools and methods .

"Business Expansion- Launching Launch 

 Challenge & Selection 

 This summer I am working for a firm as a summer intern in their strategy department and my challenge   is to create a strategy for the firm to expand its business in a new line of services . The company is   working in mechanical design domain for more than 13 years and now trying to create its name in   mechanical design training & certifications area by using in house experts .   The project scope includes   the launch of their training institute & it ’s marketing & branding . Company does n’t want to spend   much of its new resources in this project and does n’t want to take affiliations from any other   established institutes . So , our main challenges are to come up with an effective solution which   requires very fewer resources & also help the company become a brand in the field of mechanical   design training sector . The timeframe for project completion is two months . So , our main focus in this   project will be to focus on utilizing existing company resources , in house experts and marketing   department . 

 After going through several tools & processes we have decided to try the learning launch tool . This   tool is good because it will be easier to quickly test some new ideas and then implement them . As in   current scenario engagement with customers on all is necessary for any initiative to be successful . 

 Application 

 Initially , we decided to conduct market research and also conducted some market surveys to come up   with some information on the type of platforms and learning ways people prefer in the mechanical   design domain . In the initial two weeks , we collected as much information we can from customers and   then with the help of in - house experts we created a course structure as per the industry standards .   After that , we started testing our assumptions related to course structure , course material with the   students . We took regular feedback from students and incorporated more changes in our training   plan . Then we started working on the effective utilization of existing resources so that expense on the   purchase of new resources will be low . We took different assumptions and then tried to minimize the   use of resources . We recommended using old systems in working condition , in house mentors and   company infrastructure for providing training . 

 After this , we proposed a marketing plan based on current preferences of the customers . We took   feedback from customers on what type of information they want to see for this type of courses . We   conducted all these activities within 1 month of time frame . 

 Insight 

 Learning launch tool helped us identify our assumptions , customer requirements and then helped us   to design & test our assumptions . In addition to that , we took feedback from customers on each step   to make it more relevant to customers . Our results were in line with our expectations and now the   company is planning to implement the same on a broader level . 

 Approach 

 While preparing the framework for our initiative we explored many design thinking frameworks but   the learning launch tool helped us a lot . Since we wanted to continuously test our ideas and test them .   This tool proved to be very helpful . I am looking forward to using other tools & frameworks in future   projects & problems .

"Challenge & Selection 

 We conducted a design research initiative to collect community perspectives around 

 parenting goals , strengths and needs . The insights and recommendations informed how 

 the community   could better serve early childhood development outcomes . The first tool I 

 used was <NAME> <NAME> and Virtualization which l used to generate , visualize , structure 

 and classify ideas to look for patterns and insights . We do this by displaying the data and 

 asking people to cluster them in ways that allow themes and patterns to emerge . 

 Application 

 We created posters that capture key themes and trends in the collected data , then invited a 

 group of thoughtful people to tour the visual data and note any learnings that they believe 

 should inform new ideas , then we clustered the learnings into themes​. ​Through our 

 interviews , we met parents that were determined , resilient and striving to provide a stable 

 foundation for their children ’s development . They   expressed a fundamental struggle with 

 poverty — not parenting . Workshop discussions illustrated how parents set goals for 

 themselves as well as for their children . 

 They aspire to model the lives they want their children to lead , and they work to prepare 

 their children for each step of their development . The community coalitions set goals as 

 well . They ’re committed to building “ pathways of success from cradle through college and 

 career . ” Parents are enthusiastic about extending their strengths and developing new ones . 

 Coordinated services can clear the path of institutionalized barriers that impede the 

 developmental bond between parent and child . For example , access to high - quality , 

 affordable , reliable childcare unlocks multiple paths to achieving parents ’ goals . Parents 

 need confidence that the children in their lives are safe and secure in order to provide the 

 best support for a child ’s developmental growth . 

 Insights and <NAME> 

 lncluding parents as participants in the strategy , made it possible for their voices to directly 

 inform the focus of investments in their communities . This ensures successful outcomes in 

 early childhood development , as well as a positive impact on the lives and communities 

 they serve .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling 

 Storytelling helps in explaining the interconnections among people of various   backgrounds in different situations and settings , teaching broad lessons that   engage human beings as listening engages people . Stories generate plethora of   questions and questions expand the breadth and depth of stories , leading to a   lot of innovative thoughts and ideas . Storytelling becomes an important tool for   feedback , which is the basis of the iterative process of prototyping that lead to   solutions . Stories and prototypes are intertwined , explaining and repositioning   experiences through a multitude of potential interpretations , which allow   researchers to test new solutions before committing exclusively to a particular   policy , program , or service . 

 This is a story of a 19 - year old boy who was in his first year of bachelor ’s degree .   Unlike his classmate he was handicapped , shy , low self - steamed and always   molested , teased by his peers . Although he has a good academic background   but he seems like a hopeless guy who was introvert and bullied by a lot of people   around him . Meeting with this person I was not able to understand what is going   on in his mind . Just a leg injury has taken his happiness away or there is anything   else hidden in his heart . 

 I speak to him , made him as my friend , tries to make him speak , make him lighter   and around three months it took him to be comfortable and he started sharing   his thoughts with me . I was also sharing my life stories in order to help him to   visualize a state of independence , I use his feedback against the context of my   story to ascertain his goals , and sometimes we use stories to better understand   our interests and thought processes . I use this information to develop different   strategies to try and find a way that works for him and for many other people to   gain more independence in the areas they find lacking in their lives . 

 Slowly and slowly I tried to inspire him with a lot of inspiring thoughts , stories   and given a lot of biographies and autobiographies of successful personalities   most of them were physically challenged . Just giving him a ray of hope and   telling that life is so big , so many things are around to do for you as an individual   and for others made him to see life in broader prospective . Today he is working   in a multinational company . 

 So , I used a lot of stories for motivating him , sometimes a little story can do   wonders and bring success and smile in many faces . This man story can also be   inspiring too , especially , for few of the less privileged . 

 I am an engineering student ; I learn here a lot ! 

"
"Challenge   I am an analytical research scientist at a biotechnology company that collects large amounts of   data . At present only a fraction of this data is used to derive biological insights , while the   remainder is stored but not analyzed . In an internal research & development ( R&D ) project , a   member of the Data Science team and I were challenged to create a new software workflow that   would mine this unused data and report key features . Within our collaboration , I understand the   data , how it is generated and how to interpret it , while my collaborator is an expert in algorithms   and software . The challenge was that , because the new software is intended as an internal R&D   tool rather than a customer - facing product , we were given only a broad mandate for what it   should do , without specific details such as feature requirements for the software , criteria for   success , or tools to use in accomplishing those aims .      Selection   We were able to construct a prototype for the new software by working from first principles and   without taking much time to reflect on the overall structure of the project . However , once we   began to process real data and iteratively improve the software , it became clear that we needed   a more structured approach to plan and prioritize the work remaining to be done . This task fell to   me because I have a fuller understanding of the project ’s scientific context and overall goals ,   while my collaborator is focused on execution . To this end , I chose the Visualization tool   because , as mentioned in module 1 , it would help to make our ideas concrete and show us   options for further development of the software .      Application   In my implementation of the Visualization tool , I created a flowchart - like process map for our   software because it was a natural way to represent the path that data would take from input   ( raw data ) to output ( key features ) . Each software process or algorithm was represented as a   node in the flowchart , color - coded by status , such as complete , in - progress , or new .   Conceptually similar processes were grouped together . Altogether , the tool was effective   because it provided a useful way to visualize the project ’s structure and the status of various   work items , not only for my collaborator and me , but also for our managers , who previously had   only a general understanding of the software ’s features and had trouble keeping track of the   specific details .      Insight   One of the immediate insights I drew from the visualization exercise was to determine which of   the existing software components were “ good enough for now ” while others needed further   refinement and/or testing . I also generated at least one new idea simply by mapping out the   software ’s raw data inputs and realizing that one of them was completely unutilized . But   perhaps the most surprising insight came from mapping out the software ’s outputs . Although I   thought I already knew what those outputs would be , being forced to spell out this information in   the process map led to another , critical realization – specifically , that implementing a novel type   of intelligent database search was the key next step for getting to the desired outputs . We then   focused on developing that search for the ensuing 4 - 6 weeks , and it led to a quantum leap in   our ability to process new features , which in turn attracted attention from our company ’s   leadership team and won us additional resources for experimental testing .      Approach   Having experienced firsthand the power of the Visualization tool not only in organizing existing   ideas , but also in generating new ones , I strongly feel that it would be helpful to apply   Visualization at an earlier stage of project planning . I believe that , if we had done so in this   particular project , we may have saved time and allocated effort more efficiently : for example , we 

 could have identified and focused on critical components earlier on in the software development   process , and we could have avoided rewriting parts of the code to accommodate new features if   we had anticipated the need for those features from the start .

"Challenge & Selection 

 I start thinking what the best way is to brainstorm . While there are basic rules that make the process meaningful   and effective , there are dozens of ways to inspire creative ideas . Many facilitators use more than one technique in a   single brainstorming session to keep the creative juices flowing while supporting different styles of thought and   expression . Depending upon our situation , I diced to start with one of the brainstorming approaches “ Analytic   Brainstorming   ” using the <NAME> <NAME> to ensure we generate a good quantity of really useful , creative ideas to   improve our media offering and reach . 

 Application 

 Mind mapping is a visual tool for enhancing the brainstorming process . In essence , you ’re drawing a picture of the   relationships among and between ideas . Start by writing down your goal or challenge and ask participants to think   of related issues . Layer by layer , add content to your map so that you can visually see how , for example , a problem   with your company social media reach which shows limited followers or performance . So , the use of mind maps are   ways to look at information differently . This different view allows the user to get different perspectives that gives   them better insight , more clarity , peace of mind , understanding . Basically , you go from a lot of information , to a   clear view . You allow yourself to have a bigger picture overview . Mind mapping structures were used by many   people throughout history . Many smart people used it ( and probably also many people who are not that famous ) . 

 Insight & Approach 

 I discover that the most valuable aspect is shared ideas and learning , by visualization tool , which make it very easy   for everybody and let them engage and give more out of the box ideas and create a clear starting point for a series   of Design Thinking activities . Then , a revised drawing that includes their collected notes can serve as a reference   tool for the rest of their work .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> - graded assignment for ‘ Design Thinking for Business Innovation ’ , <NAME> <NAME> , 22 January   2017 

 Challenge 

 I work as engineer in a global consultancy and we have recently started to employ design thinking   tools to address challenges our clients face which were previously addressed with analytical problem- solving techniques . The most recent challenge was a request for proposal ( RFP ) to design the new   building for the school of music for a re - known university . The challenge was that this was an open   request and many engineering consultants would be competing and submitting bids . We knew we had   to do something different to differentiate ourselves and impress the client . 

 Selection 

 We selected the mind - mapping tool . This tool has the advantage that it is placed early in the process   of design thinking ( DT ) . It can be deployed with a small number of chosen participants and in a short   time frame without the need to analyse large amounts of data or secondary research . It is also not   depending on pre - requisites as it is placed in the What - Is stage . Used correctly it can subsequently be   utilised in What - If , What - Wows , and What - Works stages once the project is awarded to the firm . 

 Figure 1 – typical <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ( DT for Business Innovation , Week 3 ) 

 Application 

 We took the design criteria defined by the university in the RFP and mapped them out in a room . We   then invited a diverse group of participants to come to our ‘ yard sale ’ . Key members were music   teachers from all backgrounds ; primary school to university , with long years of experience all the way   to freshly graduated ones . They were asked to reflect on key questions such as : 

 -   What is the typical day for a student studying music ? 

 -   What are pressure points for you as a teacher teaching music ? 

 -   What facilities / spaces / tools are you missing most now / in the past ? 

 -   What good experiences / success do you / did you have in teaching music ? Which facilities /   spaces / tools enable(d ) you to enjoy / achieve these ? 

 The results from this session were recorded and included in the RFP submission to the client . The   client was very impressed with our submission and praised the unique approach which had taken   them by surprise . It created a positive vibe and encouraged the client organisation themselves to think   critically about what their drivers are for the new facility . 

 Insight 

 In taking a DT tool and deploying it with minimal effort at an early stage we were able to showcase   our ability to think creatively for the client . We were also able to open up a discussion about their real   objectives , which in the past might have been overlooked or come to light much later in the design   process causing costly changes or unhappy building owners / users . The approach provided a   differentiation against other firms competing for the design commission by simply applying a tool we   already use in a slightly different setting . The limited resource requirement and short timeframes to   deploy the tool made it suitable for this early stage where no revenue is generated for the firm . 

 Approach 

 It is likely that we would use Mind - Mapping again in a similar situation . The following key advantages   speak for Mind - Mapping : 

 -   It is placed early in the DT process and can be deployed with minimal pre - requisites 

 -   It requires a short amount of time to produce tangible results and material which can be   communicated clearly to a party outside of the process . 

 -   It requires little resources and almost no investment – crucial at this early stage when the firm   is still competing for the design commission .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I work as a Project and Business Analyst in the Construction and Engineering Industry . Our   team goal is to be able to understand each project situation and built a big picture of the   bussiness , by realting it to the current macroeconomic situation in each country where we   have operation .   Information comes weekly covering 20 to 30 project from different countries .   Without effective tools , it is very difficult to handle all these information . I was using tables to   gather ideas and concepts , but this approach proved wrong and boring . It did not allowed to   come to creative solutions nor relating concepts . Also presentations were hard to manage . 

 Selection 

 The problem has no definition , much data is involed ( but relevant ? ) and varying relationships .   For that reason , linear thinking approach ( driven by tables ) did not bring any creative value   and was hard to follow . 

 I use the Visualization Tool ( sketches , mind maps ) to fully understand the context of each   project and extrapolate ideas with pattern finding . This Tool helps me to work in creative ways   by realting projects , stakeholders and economics . I use whiteboards and sketching to show my   ideas to the team members . Members get a good understanding of my thinking process and   can contribute with their perspectives . 

 Application 

 I use the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ( pattern finding , whiteboard , mind map ) to fully understand each   project and to make relationships with stakeholders . Visual Thinking helps me to relate   concepts and communicate ideas effectively . I use whiteboards and sketches to present my   ideas and the thinking process . Every team member is involved and can contribute in creative   ways to the problem . 

 Insight 

 I thought about design thinking as a way to cultivate creativity and novelty within my work .   Little did I know , that such an easy to apply tool would bring so much difference . It help me   organize and to become more creative . The Visualization Tools were useful for fully   understanding each projects situations and the relationships between projects and economics .   It allowed the natural flow of ideas . It was great for keeping information gathered in simple   pictures and it became easy to recall when needed . 

 Presentations are much more effective than they were used to . Simple sketches bring ideas   together and allow effective team work . Prezi works very well and can easily be adapted . 

 <NAME> <NAME> of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> to learn better ? , gives insights into mind mapping for learning   and memory retention . 

 Approach 

 I am thinking about , involving other teams in the presentations to gather new insights . Our   team is already biased by our own thinking and new incorporations into the thinking process   would bring new perspectives and creative solutions .

 In future , I want to again apply story boarding because 

 it will helps every one to improve their own deeper   discrimination which easily helps us to come up with the   best ever solution . 

 Mind Mapping Connecting Ideas 

"
"Reflection 

 Visualization 

 Challenge 

 Being a budding Branding / Communication designer in the industry , I find the ability to work well and   fruitfully on a client project of great importance . To possess an open and empathetic approach towards   the client ’s requirements is a major start to lead a successful project . Since the client is not well   equipped to know what their projects really need in terms of design thinking and process , it ’s up to a   designer to facilitate that service to the client at each step forward by keeping them in the know and   making them feel like a part of the process . So challenge here is to make the client aware that why their   existing design strategy is not working well . It ’s important to make the problem clear that what exactly   needs a solution , which most client do not know and thus will be unwilling to invest in the project   further . 

 Selection 

 So for the above mentioned challenge I chose ‘ Visualization ’ as the tool of preference . The reason why I   found that visualization works best for the challenge is because it helps in starting out on a project with   an unclear brief or with seemingly limited outcomes , which is how most client based projects start out .   The design process of visualization aids in keeping a track of the project flow and not losing direction in   between . The structure provided here will ensure in coming up with most productive and functional   solutions and to take them up to prototyping and testing among consumers . This process is an umbrella   solution to most of the steps involved in coming up with a brand identity for a client , from confusion to a   cost effective and revenue generating solution . 

 Application 

 So starting out it ’s important to have it out in the clear the aspiration of your client . After listening , I   write out the questions that need to be addressed in order to further proceed . Then I like to go through   their recent old projects , to try to understand their outlook on those and how they performed in   market . This gives me a chance to understand the client mindset better and include them in the process .   I read them out all the points I noted down and draw it out for them if possible , in order for them to   understand what works and what does n’t and to make sure we ’re on the same page . Afterwards I get to   do my own research on the given information and ongoing trends for the next pitch to the client . During   this interaction I briefly brush through the previously discussed points regarding the brief of the project .   After presenting my new ideas for the new project , I like to discuss with the client on why it works in   terms of design . Any changes from the client are done , and further worked on . I make sure to keep   building client ’s confidence by providing evidence from consumer testing on a qualitative basis . This   helps in persuading the client to open up their mindset for the growth of the company by investing in a   seemingly risky but beneficial project . 

 Insight 

 Whenever I have conducted this approach with clients , it has always resulted in positive feedback from   them and even for myself . I have been told by few of them that how being involved in the design   process made them feel better about themselves as a creative , since working in black and white strips   them off the freedom to visualize . I even noticed how some people who were pretty adamant on   sticking to how they do things , eventually agree with the presented result from consumer testing   results . There is also much higher chances of satisfaction and appreciation among the clients at the   completion of project . 

 Approach 

 Ever since I learned visualization as a designer it has helped me better in aiding a client ’s requirement   for a project especially to meet deadlines on time . Each step is clear and entire process is systematic   much to my way of working , which is why I will follow the same process of visualization further in design   development and while working for a client .

"Adopting a New CRM Platform 

 Challenge 

 Two years ago , the largest division within a major financial institution migrated CRM platforms from   <NAME> to Salesforce . The migration was conducted as a “ lift and shift ” . It did not adequately account for   the divergent needs of all user communities – approximately 1,000 users , 8 distinct areas , 25   stakeholder groups . The result was a lack of user adoption , thus , a stagnant customer experience . The   division ’s leadership strongly believed opportunities existed to improve the use and utility of Salesforce . 

 Selection 

 Storytelling was selected as the tool of choice . The group responsible for the Oracle to Salesforce   migration appeared to have neglected their customer – the employees ( impacted users ) . The “ what ’s in   it for me ” was not established . We needed to know the users , and how they experience the CRM , to   develop a story / value proposition designed for them . 

 Furthermore , we needed to shift users ’ mindset to that of a “ prepared mind ” . We hypothesized that   users ’ mindsets were narrowly focused on operational / business as usual activities that had been   engrained due to the firm ’s risk adverse culture . Users ’ repertoires were largely limited to their specific   function and they did not have a strong grasp on where they fit in the customer journey or how and to   whom information and insights should flow . Customer empathy was not an organization priority and   therefore not a priority of the employees . 

 Application 

 Establishing the “ what ’s in it for me ” is personal . For smaller scale efforts , conversations with each   impacted individual can be valuable . In this situation however , the scale ( and timeline and budget ) did   not allow for that approach . Instead , we focused on user groups the business determined to have the   greatest impact on CX . We met with leadership from those groups to understand the “ what is ” , the   desired mindset and behaviors of their employees , and the value to be delivered to customers . We   conducted workshops with users to understand their perspective from big picture ( why move to   Salesforce , as a firm , what CX are we trying to provide ? ) through to individual impact ( what is expected   of me as a result of moving to <NAME> , how do I bridge my ability gaps ? ) . In the workshops , we   identified individual influencers within the user groups – employees that colleagues emulate or go to for   help ( not a HiPPO ) . We conducted interviews with each influencer , getting a “ behind the curtain ” view   of the environment and testing some of our initial storytelling points . 

 With the information in hand , we designed a layered communications campaign comprised of multiple   stories . We began with the strategic purpose and objectives of the CRM migration which was   communicated by business leaders to the user population . The story was then carried on by the user   group leaders who covered the tactical aspects / changes specific to the user group . The user group   leaders met one - on - one with their team members to deliver a personalized value proposition and to   solicit feedback on how to improve CRM adoption and CX . Additionally , the influencers championed   change within their respective groups and formed a coalition to exchange practices . 

 Results of the communications campaign were measured by surveying the user population ’s   understanding of the CRM change from both a business and personal perspective . The scores were   overwhelmingly positive on both fronts . However , the true measure of overall effectiveness will be   improved NPS and CX scores which , as of now , have not been collected . 

 <NAME> 

 There can be a multitude of underlying factors to be aware of when storytelling in the context of having   employees embrace and adopt a change . In this situation , I found organizational culture and alignment   as factors that needed to be carefully navigated . An organization known for strict risk management now   wanting employees to share data and insights across functions and create new ways of delivering value   to the customer was met with skepticism . Alignment manifested itself in two ways . First , leadership   must be aligned , communicating consistent messaging . Second , enabling factors and performance   management must be aligned to how the business wants employees to change . With regards to   enabling factors its addressing skill gaps , tailoring processes , and empowering front - line employees to   make decisions . In terms of performance management , its a program that clearly articulates   expectations and incentivizes desired employee performance and behavior ( or disincentivizes the   contrary ) . 

 <NAME> 

 You get one shot to tell a compelling story . The audience either buys in or does n’t , and they usually   do n’t offer a second chance . In this situation , I would ’ve spent more time developing the story for why   storytelling is so important ! Facing a tight timeframe , a lengthy discovery stage and communicating   what some in the organization already thought was clearly articulated and universally known ( which   obviously was n’t given the challenge they sought to remedy ) was not viewed as a top priority ( “ show me   results already ! ” ) . 

"
"Challenge 

 The challenge that <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , the organization I work for , had to face was that of a new   strategic cycle . Tata Group is a public organization where processes are very important . We   had to challenge the organization to move beyond what the procedures say . It was   necessary to work in new formats , to get out of the way we had been working in order   to take on the new challenges of the strategic period .     Selection   For this we chose a work methodology based on visualization techniques . The selection   of this tool was because I had seen its capacity in action . I was struck by the tool 's   ability to build a common vision . And that was the central part of the challenge , to be   able to share a strategy for the following years .     Aplication     The first thing we did was to visit the mission of the organization , the mission is what   we are , what we should always do . Then we refined the vision , the vision describes   what we want to be , what we would like to change , improve , strengthen in the following   years . And finally we did a great job in the discovery of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> 's values , values on which   to leverage our strategy , to have clear what are the capabilities and culture of our   organization to be able to respond to the remains of the new strategic plan . 

 Insight   & approach 

 For the definition of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> 's values , the participants chose <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> 's stories , telling them   and identifying the values that were behind these experiences and stories of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> .   Through these stories , we identified a series of values that made up the three   fundamental polarities of an organization : that which has to do with what is internal to   the entity , that which is related to its service ( in this case the clients ) and that which is   related to the environment , to society . From there , we decided that <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> is defined by 

 10 fundamental values : 

 "" Teamwork "" , "" Sustainability "" , "" Identity "" , "" Innovation "" , "" Trust and security,""Proximity   and commitment to the client "" , "" Providing the best solution "" , "" Transparency "" , "" Doing it   in collaboration with"",""Gender equality "" 

 Next time , in addition to using these tools again , I would like to have people in 

 our organization trained in these techniques so that we can use them with our customers   and explain them to them . 

"
"Challenge & selection : 

 I used to work a lot in different projects to be able to reach a good   project , I selected to talk about it as story to practice storytelling and to   see if you would want to have some of our projects . Our challenge most   of the time is money . We are a team of engineers hoping to make a   deference in the people who needs us life . 

 <NAME> is a great tool , now , I just understand how powerful it is .          This submission is about our story so read carefully you may be inspired . 

 Hope you enjoy it . We spent a lot of time learning and we still fail to   learn more . learning about design also about engineering projects and   how it can be developed . 

 Application : 

 Let me tell you a story about disable 25 years old man , his leg has been   cut in unknown situation , he prefers to not talk about the reason .   actually you can see a lot of people walking around just disabled as he is ,   some with no legs some with one and some have none either hand or   leg ! where are we ? we are in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . so where is our man   now ? today he got a hand to help him , he is moving in a wheel chair .   was n’t he ?    No , he used to crawl ! a gentle people bought it for him , now   he can use his hands to move it , he can do better in his life but he will   not be able to stand up or have a good job ! yes it is what you are   thinking about artificial limb ! What if we can offer him one ? NO , Why ?   Too expensive ! 

 Young engineering student team decided to take this problem and solve   it . So they need to design the product from zero also its needed to be   manufactured in their country to make it as cheap as possible to reach   as much as possible disabled so they can use it . 

 Let 's go back to our man now in the street ! What 's going on ? He is just   walking ! Yes , he is , it 's that product made specially for him . 

 So it 's your turn to do an action to help so that project can be done and   reach as much as possible of that people in need . 

 Insight : 

 We now know how to tell our story and how powerful and effective it is   in selling our product , our team have been working in the design of   artificial limbs , taking in account that most of our target to serve have   disabled legs we started our first design to establish there needs . 

 This is a picture for our team first design : 

 We keep adding to the design   to make it as much comfortable   and suitable for the user . 

 :    pproach A 

 Our team do not target the user for marketing but we target the people   who might help , as global disable people organizations , gentle humans   and government . Our team now in a process of learning and   understanding , we were trying to ably agile Scrum in our working plans   and we still , like daily 15 minutes meetings and monthly sprint planning   meeting and sprint review . Its every day learning management   methodology . We still learn and do mistakes . But now we can move   more steps forward applying visualization , storytelling , mindset and   mind mapping and learning lunch in our next steps in this project and   other projects we are planning to do .

"Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I was challenged by delivering Design Thinking Process to our company ’s employees in <ADDRESS> . 

 And I thought using the tool of Visualization is the best way to understand the power of <ADDRESS> . 

 Our company runs manufacturing business mainly and most of participants for the program were 

 from Plant engineering department and business planning department . They had n’t got many 

 chances to deal with design materials like drawing pens and <NAME> blocks . I thought they would 

 have fun time with those materials while they think power of design real things . 

 Application 

 First I delivered Importance of Design to quote <NAME> <NAME> “ <NAME> is not just what it looks like 

 and feels like . Design is how it works . ” and <NAME> <NAME> , CEO of IDEO . 

 And we found out together many success stories based on satisfaction for customer needs like 

 Embrace <NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> <NAME> , Business <NAME> <NAME> from internet . Also we found out our 

 stories we focused on customers ’ needs . 

 Then , I gave a task for practicing a design process that finding out customers ’ pain points during 

 travel abroad and do rapid prototyping with some materials like color pencils , <NAME> blocks , clay , 

 straws . It is recommended to use the Visualization technique to make ideas and different options 

 feel more tangible and real to participants . 

 Insight & Approach 

 They made awesome outputs with fun time , and they were surprised to realize how creative they 

 could be . And lots of participants told me when they started to make real things with design 

 materials , they found out what they were missing from their initial ideas and they could fix it . 

 It seemed they felt the importance of Prototyping and Test , learning agility at same time . I think I 

 will use this kind of tools continuously for delivering the power of design . 

 Here are some photos they made .

"Reflection – ​Visualization 

 <ADDRESS> and selection   I am a project leader in a software company . We work with clients that bring us some 

 needs , and we create a solution for them . We created what our clients tell us to do 

 without questioning whether the solution will really fit their needs . This approach 

 impacts the clients ’ satisfaction at the end of the project . We had several dissatisfied 

 customers , even if we deliver the software as they asked . So , I realized that the 

 problem is not in the production , but it is in the idea conception .      We received a new project to design a website to help mothers buy baby and kids 

 clothes . In the first meeting , we proposed our client apply an ethnographic to help 

 understand the real problem . We aim to create a visualization of the process of the 

 clothes purchase of the mothers . The client is a little skeptical , but after we explained 

 the possible benefits , he accepted . So , we started our project by doing a Journey 

 Mapping with mothers . The main idea was to discover which are the primary needs 

 of these mothers in this process . Besides just analyze the process , we tried to 

 understand their fears and the emotions in the process .     Application   We selected 20 mothers from 22 years old up to 33 years old with newborn children 

 up to 3 years old . We follow these mothers in the entire process of searching and 

 buying clothes . We go along with each mother individually , from the shopping mall 

 entrance , choosing the right store , looking at the entire cloth catalog , finding the 

 clothes that fit in their kids , and , finally , finalizing the buy . We also accompanied how 

 they organized the clothes and what they did with the clothes that no longer fit . 

 Finally , we also asked these mothers to maintain a photo diary with each clothes the 

 kids used . They take pictures and created an album of them .      With these data , we created flows of each mother ’s process to describe how they did 

 her process . We also used the album to see if the kids used the clothes recently 

 bought .      Insight   We discover a whole new world ! The first thing is that the mothers have two types of 

 purchases that we classified as an emotional purchase and a daily purchase . The 

 emotional purchase is that clothes that generate a good feeling in it . The mothers 

 loved to search for a lovely piece of cloth for their kids and feel the material . This is a 

 moment of the mother with her kid . We do not think to change that . But the daily 

 purchase is fastly , and there is not an emotion in it . We found out that the daily 

 purchase is the purchase which fills the bigger part of the clothes necessity . Also , 

 this daily purchase is very stressful for the mothers . 

 We also discover that the process of deal with clothes that do not fit anymore is 

 complicated . Some mothers passed these clothes to other mothers , but most do not 

 have someone to transfer them . Therefore , the mothers maintain these clothes , 

 creating messy and difficult management . Another insight was that the clothes of 

 daily purchase are the clothes with more utilizations ! We saw that in the pictures 

 from the album .      Approach   I think that the first experiment was excellent and deliver to our client a lot of 

 important insights . The next time , we need to found how to do this in a less invasive 

 way . We take a lot of time for these mothers , and this was stressful for both sides . 

 The album is a good idea for maintaining a diary easily . The mothers prefer that then 

 write which clothes are used .      Our client saw the visualizations created in this process and changed the entire 

 application to meet these needs better .

"Learning Launch 

 1 . Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 My challenge takes part in the Digitalization field . My company is indeed looking to digitalizing their interactions with the customers . The idea was to funnel all the requests of the customer in one single place from which the company 's teams can respond . The idea was to create a simple form that the customer would fill to send a request to the company 's teams . The form had to include some drop down fields to be filled by the customer defining the type of request being sent . The type of request defines the appropriate persons who can respond to the request . The so - called "" ticket "" is directly sent to the right contact . The customer is also able to track all the requests and their status on the platform . The first step of course is to test the idea with some customers . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture references ) . 

 The tool selected to tackle the challenge is the Learning Launch Tool . This tool is often used to quickly test an idea using a prototype that is exactly what is needed in this situation . The outputs of the test will help deciding whether to continue or stop the project . The learnings from the test will also provide good opportunities and ideas to improve the project . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 After creating the prototype of the form , I selected some customers and their associated teams . The customers who accepted to take part into the test phase had to use the online platform to interact with the teams instead of using e - mails . As explained in the course , the initial assumption was confronted to the needs of the customers to understand if the project could be valuable . The test phase lasted about two months in order to collect enough data and returns of experience . At the end of phase , the customers and teams shared their insights on the value raised and potential improvements . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about design thinking more broadly ) . 

 The Learning Launch Tool gave me a frame to follow in order to run the test . I think that the course outlined the fact that the Learning Launch Tool has to be used on a short period of time . I indeed tried to make it a short as I could and it was very beneficial to be able to understand as much the benefits / drawbacks of the an idea . It was helpful as it quickly proved that the idea is valuable and that there is even more potential for improvement . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 I think I will continue to use the Learning Launch Tool as I have many ideas to test . I will however try to make the time frame even shorter and make sure to choose the right people to on - board on the test . 

 Thanks for reading :)

"Reflection – Visualization   Date : 270220     Challenge   The story started when I stepped into a new job last year as a research and development engineer   leader . This company has run for almost 20 years . Like many firms , there are many toxic people with   fixed mindset and old skill set . Moreover , the culture of this company was silo . The situation was when   you got the new brilliant idea which was better for every stakeholder including those toxic people but   they had been against you because they just do not want to change anything . My challenge was how   can I convince and make everyone have the same picture as mine . I had to empathize them to know   how they think and explain why my new solution would help them .      Selection   The tool I selected was visualization . Many times , an image had more power than hundreds of words .   I used this tool to project my idea to let others understand the boarder picture , where would we go ,   which parts they were responsible for . Since the diversity of people ’s ages and types , they had got the   different terminologies , various backgrounds . So , I used visualization to embed pictures , graphs to   their minds to make them look at the same goal .       Application   I started with visualizing the entire picture of the system in my company via a diagram . Many of them   had worked for years , but they only did jobs from their point of view . With aspect from outside , I was   able to spot their strengths and weaknesses . A lot of works were unnecessary , they however did them   because they were used to . My diagram comparatively showed that they could reduce the procedure   and also the cost . There were two departments which did almost tasks for the same purposes . They   never talked or exchanged information to each other . Visualization helped them see their part in the   business and accept a new method . I did not show only the diagram , but also the long - term effects of   the novel method . If it is good for you , you will do it . That is the fundamental of how people think .   Therefore , the visualization came to the show again . I showed what they would get when you   complete this new project . One of the key benefits of visualization is inclusion , I can say .     Along with the progress of the new project , the process of visualization had to be continuously done .   When anyone completed any part of anything , everyone should have the same understanding of what   was done in the big picture . I and my colleagues revised our diagram of the project every week .     Insight   After using visualization , I can convince other people easier than earlier . When they look at the same   picture , the communication is much more effective .     By the way , only visualization is hard to make people adopt your idea . Someone still can not get your   point . I have to admit that some concept is difficult to visualize . The process of visualization took more   efforts and time than I had thought . There are so many visualization tools out there . To choose the   right tool for the right concept is very challenging .      Approach   As I got a lesson that only visualization might be not enough , I think if I can combine another tool , it   will be helpful . Story telling is the one I need . After you visualize it , you have to explain it attractively .   This way , I can lead the team as one .

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 Challenges & Selection     I define myself as a continuous storyteller ; I use this method in every moment in my life and I 

 did n’t even know it . This course helped me to find out that . I work a lot with kids as an 

 environmental teacher for kids of places of scarce resources ; where my main mission is to 

 teach them about how to have an ecological life respecting the nature at the same time they 

 get involved with their communities using what they have learned during the classes .   I spend a lot of time trying to reach to these kids minds , trying to found out ways to make 

 them feel appreciated and to make them feel like their opinions and their actions really have 

 a meaning for their communities and the world .   The main tool that I ’ve seen that works is the storytelling ; this tool is wonderful to reach kids 

 minds ; they love to listen about a goods story and also to tell some stories . In this process 

 we include their parents ; because they are an essential in the process of continuing this 

 stories on their houses so the kids could really have a feeling about them .     Application      I was working with a small group of 12 kids and 3 more volunteers that were helping me with 

 the main objective of the classes . That weekly task was to talk about the four elements in 

 nature and how they can be used to preserve life and the balance in nature or how they can 

 be used in the destruction of everything ; elements like : fire , earth , wind and water .   So we as volunteers were talking about how to make this theme reachable to this kids in 

 other they could understand the idea and also they could feel related and involved with it .   We reach to the conclusion to use the ​storytelling ​tool ; we told them a story about ancient 

 guardians ; that they used to take care of the four element ( Water , earth , wind and fire -kind 

 of the avatar story ) this guardians were getting weak every day and they need new recruits 

 to continue with their task , and it was their mission to be them . We implement a system 

 where they were classified by ages in order they could n’t get injured : The older kids ( kids 

 around 16 - 17 years old ) get the task of being the guardians of the fire , the rest of the kids 

 were mixed with the rest in order to being the guardians of the earth , wind and water .   This was one of our best dynamics with that group ; we really reached this kids and their 

 parents told us the next week that their kids were really focused in their task and they 

 wanted to learn more about the theme .     Insight & Approach     As I 've already tell ; this was one of the best dynamics we implement with the kids ; the 

 parents start asking us about they dynamics and how they can get involved in the process 

 with their sons . One of the parents asked me about the process of how to make his son 

 focused in something and how to make him interested on one theme ; I explain him that he 

 needed to create an idea where the kid could feel part of it and that he could feel that his 

 effort really is appreciated and it works for something bigger ( in the case ; the protection of 

 nature and his paper as a guardian ) . 

 I ’d no idea that was a design thinking process , and this course helped me to understand the 

 power of this topic and the way that it could be used to help the perception of the people 

 about one theme in specific .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge : 

 I ’m a final year undergraduate student in an Indian College . The college administration 

 invited final years for discussions to develop measures to make our campus more friendly for 

 women . On discussing about this issue with our female friends in college , we arrived at our 

 problem statement : “ Promoting Gender Equity in Campus ” . Our campus is very 

 conservative . While men are given enough freedom to do as they wish throughout the day , 

 women are confined within their hostels post a 9 PM curfew . The issue of Promoting Gender 

 Equity in Campus could be considered a “ wicked problem ” . 

 Tool Selection : 

 To tackle this wicked problem , we made use of the tool : Storytelling . Storytelling engages 

 people and allows us to understand their unarticulated needs as they share their experiences 

 and values ( Ref . Week 2 Lecture4 <URL> 

 thinking - innovation / lecture / PAXCd / storytelling - tool ) . It explains the interconnections among 

 people in situations and settings , and teaches broad lessons that engage real human beings . 

 Stories generate questions , questions expand the breadth and depth of stories and this leads to 

 lots of innovative thoughts and ideas . 

 Tool Application : 

 We invited both male and female friends to talk about their routines . As they shared their 

 routines , the female friends observed the striking differences between their routines and the 

 routines of our male friends . We made use of journals maintained by our friends to 

 understand their needs better . We also asked our friends to imagine a situation where they 

 would be free to do as they wish and then asked them to narrate what they imagined . 

 Insight : 

 The female friends unanimously agreed that the 9 PM curfew was the main problem which 

 inhibited them from doing something that one of our male friends could do at night ( Like 

 going to a shop within campus to eat noodles or access our computer centre ) . However , they 

 also agreed that the curfew was an assurance to their parents that they were safe . So we 

 finally suggested the administration to introduce curfew free zones for women within campus 

 ( other than hostel ) where they could spend time even post curfew , and make the curfew time 

 10 PM instead of 9 PM . The administration tried this for one month ( before we had to come 

 back home due to lockdown ) . So far , the results have been promising . The women in our 

 campus could enjoy more freedom without any compromise on their safety . 

 Approach : 

 An alternative approach that could be used is <NAME> <NAME> . <NAME> <NAME> will help in 

 looking for patterns and themes in the data concerning the routines of female students ( Ref . 

 Week 3 Lecture 4 <URL> 

 innovation / lecture / lsFRa / mind - mapping - tool ) . This can kick start the idea generation process 

 which can help in developing ideas to look at our problem statement with a different 

 perspective . We have n’t tried this alternate approach , but I ’m sure this approach would give 

 some amazing ideas to tackle the problem of Promoting Gender Equity in <ADDRESS> .

"Challenge   My company was in the process of constructing a new office building to hold ~2,400 employees .   I was part of the project team from the ICT department assigned to determine which new   technologies would be fitted into the building . These technologies had to be useful ,   cost - effective and would be the future standard in other new buildings . We had several   proposals prepared , each with a napkin pitch and behind those , a small pack of information we   had collected while preparing the initial pitches .   In the current office buildings there was already an issue with meeting rooms being fully booked   and unavailable when people needed them . Through interviews and Q&A sessions we   discovered people were concerned that in the new open plan offices this situation would get   worse . People were particularly concerned that in the open plan environment , if they wanted to   take a discussion to a room to avoid disturbing others , they would have difficulty finding one to   use in that moment . For these reasons we decided to push forward with one of our pitches to fit   touch panels outside of meeting rooms . These panels had lights on , that were visible at a   distance to show if a room was available and if a group did n’t arrive to claim a room in a set   period of time it would free the room up for others to use . We presented this idea to local   management but they were not convinced . In particular the local head of finance did not think   we could prove the panels brought enough value to make them worthwhile .     Selection   We were still convinced we had a good proposal . We elected to do a learning launch ,   essentially a fast experiment , to enable us to gather the data needed or prove or disprove our   assumptions quickly without much more investment . A learning launch follows a specific   process ; define a hypothesis , identify key assumptions , prioritise those assumptions , design   tests for the key assumptions and then do those tests . If you prove the assumptions correct   scale up your experiment , if you prove your assumptions were wrong either tweak the idea and   try again or shelve the idea for a later date . ( You can see this process in the module 4 video   from Ed <NAME> around the 15 minute mark . )     Application   For our first learning launch we set out with the hypothesis that people were n’t able to   collaborate efficiently as they were n’t able to find an appropriate space to do so and tested the 3   top priority assumptions ; that the rooms were booked most of the time , that they were often not   in use and that people did n’t have somewhere else to collaborate . We proved our assumptions   by interviewing people and manually monitoring 3 rooms near to the team . It was found that   these rooms were booked almost all of the time but only in use around half of the time .   As we proved our assumptions in the first learning launch we decided to do a longer and more   detailed study . With the hypothesis that the touch panels would improve the situation we worked   to disprove some “ disconcerting facts ” : That people would not use them , that they would not be   user friendly , that even if people checked in and out they would n’t encourage reuse and that   cancelling booked meetings when people did n’t show up on time would cause major issues . We   managed to secure several touch panels on a trial basis and used the contacts from our   multifunctional team to have them installed at 4 rooms at next to no cost . We ran the trial for 1 

 month . At the end we had data for the ~400 meetings that had been held . We disproved all of   our facts . Showing the touch panels freed up the rooms when not in use and we could show that   people then re - booked this freed up time . The panels were intuitive to use and were really   appreciated by the people using these rooms . We also proved the panels integrated well with   our other IT systems .   We presented our findings including testimonials and facts to the local management team and   got unanimous agreement to fit the panels in the companies new office building . This began our   final learning launch to prove our idea still worked at scale . <NAME> touch panels were fitted in the   new building . We gathered data over 3 months and found ~15,000 hours of meetings were   booked each month , approximately 2/3 of this was then freed up by the panels when meetings   finished early or nobody arrived . ~40 % of this freed up time was then rebooked and used .   Interviews and surveys showed the panels had a very positive reception from the people in the   building . After a final presentation to local and transnational management the touch panels are   now included in the standard equipment for new buildings .     Insight   Applying the learning launch tool gave my team a powerful and structured method of   experimenting . Having assumptions and disconcerting facts that we were aiming to prove or   disprove meant the experiments had a lot of drive and purpose and a clear definition of done   which I hope to apply in other work as well . We did n’t always identify every assumption we   needed to test at the start but we were adaptable enough to pick up extra data as we went and I   believe that is important . While we were expecting a positive outcome the results were even   better than expected . Although the initial challenge is now completed the team will continue with   the learning launch approach to ensure we are achieving value with further transnational   rollouts .     Approach   I firmly believe using the learning launch tool was the right choice in this scenario , although in   the future I would be sure to keep an open mind while selecting assumptions to try to avoid   missing any . Storytelling could have also been beneficial when trying to sell the idea to local   management . Everyone present would have had the experience of not being able to find a room   to book in the system or hunting down a room for an impromptu meeting . Storytelling could have   helped them relate to the issue , form that emotional connection and solidify in their minds the   issue we were trying to solve . It could also have really helped them imagine how the solution   would work and boosted the energy and passion in the room to drive everyone toward a   solution .

"My reflection on Visualization 

 Challenge 

 Often , I face challenges in gathering the idea and document it effectively and efficiently , without having a   pictorial representation or visualization it was difficult to me to address them effectively an in timely   manner . As I manage a global team in delivering solution to customers my team is often need to re - think ,   re - imagine certain tasks , process , principles this is a herculean task to get the feedback from all   stakeholders , I usually run my team meetings to report the problem directly to me as I must provide   direction / decision to complete the project or tasks at on time , when there is a problem then it requires   brainstorming from various stakeholders , to bring them all into one page this pushes think beyond what   we do from a regular operations management 

 Selection 

 I use Fishbone method to capture the large problem statement and drive the root cause analysis , I   typically used fishbone diagram for root cause analysis , a fishbone diagram combines the practice of   brainstorming with various stakeholders with a type of mind map template . It is efficient to drive   collaboration and gives space for others to voice out effectively . This also helps to run process   simplification and helps to avoid wastages . 

 Example for a fishbone diagram from my work while office was remain open , 

 Application 

 As I capture the problem statement through various sources , such as voice of customer , survey , E - mail ,   Risk reporting and meeting with individual and teams , once I have identified potential problem and to   solve , Now a days , I use <URL> Since its digital era and we continue to work from home for   more than year an online collaboration and visualization tool is much better idea to collaborate with team ,   the online tool helps me to brainstorm new ideas together in real time , make connections between ideas   and solutions , and much more . This is a great tool for the ideation and strategic planning process . We   also like the visual nature of creating maps and diagrams to bring our ideas to life in a digital space and   an interactive space to collaborate , update and re - navigate . Once i have setup a space for the team and   an identified problem statement , i create a blank fishbone template with a problem statement pointing on   the right and the possible root cause growing from right to left , then in an scheduled meeting we   collaborate with team to come together with ideas and capture them in right space and prioritize to solve 

 with an agreed timeline . This is the same method that has been followed in manufacturing practices to   drive <ADDRESS> for years and its effective to drive simplification in IT as well . 

 For brainstorming and driving effective results , I run <NAME> an approach that pushes forward the   continuous improvement in delivering key outcome , 

 Insight 

 The fishbone diagram gives a visual representation over the problem statement and provides quick   insights on the root causes and potential problem solving techniques and while we go through a <NAME>   approach it improves teamwork as I engage all the involved members , discipline on alignment and   engagement without any chaos or disagreement , improved team morale as we listen to all the involved   persons and gives space to every individual , they feel that they are empowered to voice out and feel   included , and suggestions for improvement as ideas created at all level , The more likely I am able to   achieve a sense of agreement and consensus with people 

 In real time organization need people who can see the bigger picture - those who listen , who find   patterns , and make connections . The environment around us is complex and needs us to strengthen our   ability capture and organize ideas . We always need more in - depth knowledge . We need more shared   understanding . We need more simplification and problem - solving approach . the more we are likely to   draw out conversation . In an environment where our ability to get things done and to solve problems is   dependent on other people being able to understand us and align their ideas with us in more meaningful   way . 

 Approach 

 In future , I am thinking to have regular sessions with team to drive proactive approach to any potential   problem or any unforeseen circumstance which may come as surprise . Instead of problem - based   approach will shift to proactive approach and use my team free time to grow , evolve and address   potential problems , I will keep a open fishbone dashboards which can grow in offline as well where team   can go ahead add or amend the data whenever they feel to be reported . I am also thinking to include a   scrum master to drive the initiative in a full - time space who can keep reporting on the changes and   improves continuous delivery in order to improve better user experience .

"Reflection – learning launch 

 <ADDRESS> and selection 

 In my daily work I focus on helping my clients to increase the satisfaction of IT end - users   around the globe . Data - driven insights is our main driver to uncover potential improvement   points within organizations . Providing stakeholders in various industries with the right   insights is challenging , due to that fact people in different positions and organizations will be   using these insights differently . Using our business intelligence tools we thrive to present   valuable insights in different kind of visuals and user sentiment around it . Nonetheless ,   sometimes we miss the insights that make the difference for our clients . We then decided to   use the learning launch approach in in which we conduct cheap and fast experiments and   gather clients input as quick as possible . We combined it also with the agile way of working   and defining small sprints in which we have defined outcomes and deliverables . 

 Application 

 In our learning launch designed small workshops with our main stakeholders to co - create   the business intelligence reports . In these workshops we produced prototypes of potential   reports and shared it with them to review it and provide feedback .   Within these sessions   we iterate the process few times until we reach a prototype that can help the stakeholders   to get the most value of report in very short time and incorporate their feedback early in the   process . Traditionally we will have a requirement gathering session in which we ask them   how they wanted the report to be then we start designing the report without these   sessions . This way , indeed , led to lots of recreating the product , doubling the work and a bit   of client dissatisfaction . Hosting these sessions resulted in shorter time to pushing product   to production and gave the client a feeling of being part of the product creation journey . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Using this method , we gained better customer relationships as well as less working hours   wasted on developing the product . We then start to expand our products and services in   collaboration with our clients . This approach gave us more flexibility to adapt to our   stakeholder needs . They can now co - create the product with us and put their priorities by   themselves . This approach gave more information on the difference between what the   developer thinks is important and what the client thinks about it ! 

 In future , I will combine with learning launch with storytelling and mind mapping tools . I   expect his will give the client more room to express their needs in story fashion or with   some drawings which can assist us in better understanding their needs .

"AG 1 

 Storytelling 

 Challenge     As a project manager at a non - profit organization that provides psychological services to children and teens , my   organization was recently faced with what our course has referred to as a “ wicked problem . ” My organization was   confronted by a sharp rise ( almost double compared to the previous year ) in referrals from school counselors and   school - based juvenile probation officers for children and teens who had violated school policies to the extent that   expulsion was warranted . The spike in referrals was due to schools ’ increasing adoption of “ zero tolerance ” policies   related to drugs , alcohol , and violence on school grounds — rather than discipline students individually , schools were   opting to expel students in large numbers after their first offense .     The challenge , then , was to develop a systematic and evidence - based approach to meet the psychological and social   needs of students who had recently been expelled , in order to decrease school expulsions overall throughout the   community school corporation . This challenge was “ wicked , ” however , because the students ’ needs and backgrounds   were vastly different . A “ one - size - fits - all ” program was simply not going to resolve the challenge faced by the students ,   schools , and our community as hundreds of students were expelled from area middle & high schools each semester . My   team and I were tasked with rolling out an outpatient psychological treatment program that would decrease the level of   school expulsions in the community by addressing the needs of the students who had been expelled for a variety of   offenses — drugs , alcohol , and violence .     Selection     I ’d like to jump ahead a bit to the point in the process when preliminary plans had been made to roll out our program   for the first time . After two months of preparation , my team and I had obtained school , community , parent , and student   perspectives to inform the development of an evidence - based therapeutic program to decrease school expulsion rates .   The next step was identifying particular schools in the area to take a leap , and partner with our organization to   implement the new program . In order to obtain buy - in from school administrators , we selected the storytelling tool to   incorporate into our on - site presentations while we visited schools to advertise our program . As our course has outlined ,   storytelling provides program managers like myself with the opportunity to synthesize a complex array of variables to   communicate a clear , compelling message to stakeholders . As <NAME> <NAME> explains in <NAME> 2 : 

 “ What I think storytelling does , is it brings a different element . Storytelling says it 's not about the list of things   we have to do , it 's about the connection that we give to people about a piece of information that we 're trying to   share . A good story at its essence , is simply conveying a message that has logic . It has emotional connection ,   and   it also has larger purpose . Storytelling is the difference between solving a problem and creating a cause . ” 

 In order to pull together the diverse sets of needs , perspectives , and goals of the students committing policy violations ,   the families responding to the stress of the expulsions , and the school administrators doling out expulsions at alarming   rates , my team and I opted to centralize the stories of the students themselves . In this way , we cut through the ambiguity   of stereotypes about “ trouble makers , ” and provided anonymous stories about the students whose lives were disrupted   by poverty , divorce , bullying , and grief . We shared their personal stories with school administrators to increase empathy   for the students , and generate stakeholders ’ emotional investment in not just punitive measures , but reformative   disciplinary strategies that aligned with their mission as educators — to put students first .     Application     As the program lead , I scheduled on - site presentations at dozens of area schools to meet with school administrators and   introduce our new program . I scheduled presentations with any school administrator who would make time for me . I   presented formal PowerPoints in conference rooms , took impromptu walks with principals as they monitored their halls ,   and settled for the occasional phone call if that was all they could do .    All of my presentations were anchored by specific stories of students who belied the typical “ trouble maker ” stereotypes   that are often conjured in administrative discussions about disciplinary policy . The reality was , I argued , that very few   students commit serious violations with the elaborate planning and malicious intent we impose on the “ trouble maker ”   type . Through student accounts and stories , I demonstrated that many students actually lacked coping skills to respond 

 AG 2 

 to serious triggers in their personal lives — the death of a sibling , or an abusive event that they ’d kept a secret , for   instance .     I used key quotations from students and their families , data related to expulsion rates , and success stories from my prior   patients to weave together a clear message for my audience : when students are expelled from school , everyone — the   child , their family , the school , and the broader community — suffers . For most at - risk youth , school is their source of   social connection with peers , nutrition , and mentoring with safe adults . As a result , no one benefits when students are   permanently removed from their classrooms . My program would provide individualized assessments and treatment   plans , in collaboration with students , their families , and their school administrator , to address the challenges that led to   expulsion . If the treatment plans were successfully completed and the student demonstrated progress ( measured by   creative goal - setting with the student and their parent ) , the administrators agreed to allow the student to complete online   classes during treatment , followed by readmission to school .     Insight     As I reflect about utilizing the storytelling tool to increase stakeholder participation in my psychological program , I   realize just how valuable the tool is to bridge divides between social groups with very little in common . Often , my task   was to tell the stories of underprivileged students in a way that made their pain , pressures , and goals tangible to school   administrators with immense power and privilege . Storytelling provided me with an incredible opportunity to “ create a   cause , ” rather than “ solve a problem , ” as <NAME> <NAME> suggests above . Before my meetings with school administrators ,   they viewed students and their illicit behavior as “ problems , ” which made expulsion an increasingly common tool in   their toolkits ; expelling students , to the administrators , eliminated the “ problem . ”      In the first year of implementation , however , the program cut school expulsion rates in half throughout our community .   This was , in large , part , due to the ability of storytelling to reframe the problem space for school administrators ,   students , and their families . When stakeholders stopped viewing the students as problems , but as whole people with   unmet needs , the possibilities and potential for collaboration flourished . When students succeeded in quitting drugs ,   managing anger , or working through secret traumas , everyone felt a sense of pride about their progress . Now that I ’m   pivoting from psychotherapy to the tech space , I ’m beginning to acquire language for the way that design thinking was   ( unknowingly ) an effective framework for the development of my program . I did n’t realize that , much like The Good   Kitchen case example in Module 1 , design thinking was so applicable to matters of social programming ( and not simply   tech ) . I now see that the core questions — What is ? What if ? What wows ? What works?—provide a path to successful   problem solving across disciplines and problem spaces .     Approach     The course learning about the steps in the design thinking process have made me realize that I could have used personas   to generate a more comprehensive and compelling account of why my program was relevant to stakeholders . I did n’t   know what persona building looked like at the time , but now realize that I could have generated a handful of personas to   lend an even more human - centered dimension to the roll out of the therapeutic program . This might have been   especially useful in my meetings with administrators who were skeptics , that only gave me about 10 minutes of their time   to explain my program . I could have attended those meetings equipped with visual copies of personas , and asked them   to tell me about which ones reminded them of their students to generate a quick , more emotional connection to the   students ’ stories .

 The design process is a multi - layered process in which many mental , cognitive and perceptual   mechanisms come into play . Understanding of the process and design can only be possible with the   comprehension of the act of design that progresses as a complex pattern until the design product   emerges . An evaluation that develops solely on the design object may be incomplete in terms of how   the design was made or how to make a better design . For this reason , deciphering the design   process , which is defined as a poly - pattern in terms of its complex structure and synchronous   processes , will provide positive contributions to the field of design knowledge . 

 Visualization or visualization is any technique for creating images , diagrams or animations to convey   a message . Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way of communicating both   abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity . Examples from history include cave   paintings , Egyptian hieroglyphs , Greek geometry , and <NAME> da <NAME> 's revolutionary technical   drawing methods for engineering and scientific purposes . 

 Today , visualization , science , education , engineering ( eg product visualization ) , interactive   multimedia , medicine , etc . It has applications that are constantly expanding in fields . A typical   example of visualization applications is in the field of computer graphics . The invention of computer   graphics ( and 3D computer graphics ) may be the most important development in visualization since   the invention of central perspective in the Renaissance . The development of animation has also   helped improve visualization .

 Role of animations in Teaching - Learning 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I used for better learning concepts is to encourage visual thinking . I work with   students of diversified background with different level of learning capabilities and in school   education , the medium is not English . Hence , students from rural areas and non - English   medium students find very difficult to cope up with the regular classes in higher education . I   have spent a lot of time in making them understand the concepts , simultaneously the other   group of students find simple and felt bored with the extended lectures . 

 In these circumstances , I thought of introducing concepts with animations and applications   first than theorems and hypothesis . The learning makes easier and through understanding   because of the animations . 

 Application 

 I start the new concepts with an application and its function with an animation . This   motivates the students from non - English medium to understand better and creates interest   in the topic . Also , after the lectures , I will share weblink ’s which creates interest in this topic   and make them learn English slowly . I confirmed the same by conducting some informal   interactions with the students and understanding their difficulties in learning . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Though the response is better , the surprise test conducted during the classes ensures the   improvement in learning capabilities and the presentation skills of the students . The   language barrier was slowly reducing and it encourages students to learn new concepts at   lesser time . Also , scientific visualization makes the student to ‘ think differently ’ ,   improvement in approaching and analysing the real - time engineering problem . 

 The animation is important because it makes us be able to communicate emotions and   ideas in a unique , easy - to - perceive way . Animation has helped connect student in a way   that sometimes conventional teaching is helpless . The timely feedback from students   helped me to understand the problem and subsequent discussions and survey is the starting   point for the design thinking activities . The new way of teaching concepts with the real - time   sound still makes to learn better in a short period .

"Storytelling is an important way of sharing experiences and forming connections with people . I have used storytelling   as a tool numerous times . I work as a marketing manager for an animal rescue centre , where , although the focus is   largely on the animals , it ’s the people who need convincing when it comes to adoption , donation , etc . I found the   best way to form a connection between the person and the animals is , along side letting them interact , telling the   people the stories behind each animal . 

 I remember meeting an elderly lady once who got along with all of the animals and took such joy playing with them .   She told me about the numerous cats and birds she had at home , describing them and telling their stories , about   how she ’s rescued some of them , some she ’d adopted , how she could tell them all apart from small features and   little mannerisms . 

 I , in return , told her about some of the animals she was cuddling with at the time . She realised one of the older cats   would get along very well with her pets , and adopted her immediately . 

 I had always seen storytelling as a normal part of life , a general rule of thumb for human interaction , but I never   realised it could help business - wise as well . Not only did it create connections , but it got a cat a forever home . 

 This course has taught me about the importance of using storytelling for human connection and business innovation .

"Challenge and choice    I am a student in architecture , as we design different buildings , and this major requires   design thinking with its various tools . We often use the photography tool because it   simplifies ideas and most importantly , everyone can understand them , even with   different languages , as they are illustrations or pictures .    We collect information and simplify it in the form of photographs or illustrations , then   annotate these images , analyze them , and then draw conclusions in the form of   drawings or pictures as well .    We started out as a team . We were asked to design a new school in an old school    setting , and the design had to be adequate in form and function .      The application    First , we started searching and investigating similar examples of schools to study their   form and function , and after we gathered information about different schools , we   presented them in the form of pictures , illustrations , and some information that we   had collected ,   and we arranged them in terms of form , operation and performance ,   i.e. we put a picture of a specific place in one of the schools that we studied . Then we   draw or put an illustration of how this place is operating and then another drawing or   picture to evaluate the performance of this operation ( look at picture 1 ) After that we   presented all of this and discussed it with professors who are experts in this field and a   group of students , where the drawings and pictures allow them to understand the data   in an easy and simple way And then give their observations and opinions .     Then we studied the site in which the school will be built , where we collected data on   the region ’s climate , the movement of the sun , the best roads leading to it , the traffic   congestion and the population density in that area , and we also studied the schools   near the project site in terms of their capacity for students and the type of school if it   was primary , intermediate or Secondary , whether they are girls ' , boys ' or mixed   schools , to find out where the shortage lies and what kind of school we need the most   in that region . We also studied the level of the land and the type and shape of nearby   buildings , and collected all this information in the form of pictures or simple   illustrations , for example : 

 Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Thus , we simplified the data so that everyone could understand it without effort .   Then we hung these drawings and pictures of the site analysis and discussed them   with expert professors and a group of architecture students in order to express their   opinions with the best solutions . We discussed this data 3 times and each time we   take into account the opinions of the professors   And notice them , then we   reanalyze , and then discuss again .      After that , we extracted some results in the form of drawings . For example , we drew   how the   building blocks ( the school ) would look , for example , the side that has   strong winds has small windows .    As for places close to noise , we decided to have playgrounds and patios . As for   classrooms and the library , we decided to place them in places quieter than the plot   of land , and we also took into account the direction of the seasons so that they get   enough natural light and have indirect lighting . As for some places of the project land   that were close to places where the pollution and smoke of cars , we decided to put   some trees and plants in them to purify the air entering the school , and we drew all   of this as an illustration in the summary . ( look at pictures 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ) . 

 Insight    The visualization tool is a very useful tool , as it helped us to think smoothly by   placing all the data in a simplified form in the form of pictures or drawings , then   deducing solutions and the summary in the form of pictures . It is also easy for the   non - information collector to understand this information simply and effortlessly and   even if he speaks a different language . graphics and images are a language   International , this performance helped us to arrange our ideas and come up with   good solutions .    Approach    The visualization tool is very important and useful , and we will not dispense with it   in our future projects . Nevertheless , we sometimes need other tools with it , such as   a mind mapping tool to clarify some ideas ( look at picture 6 ) . 

 We indicate the direction of the cold wind with blue arrows , and the hot wind   with red arrows . We also indicated places of noise near the site with a   loudspeaker . We explained the girls ’ schools near the project site by drawing a   small building in pink , and the nearby boys ’ schools by drawing a building in blue .

"Design Thinking for Innovation                                                                                  <NAME> <NAME> 

 1 . Challenge 

 During my Master Thesis in Marketing , one of my course mate ( let ’s call him <NAME> ) asked   me and 5 other students to develop an idea . The idea itself was quite broad and not   well defined , and since <NAME> did n’t explain this idea to all of us simultaneously , we all   have different opinions and impressions about that . Briefly , the idea was to build a   website where students like us , or just young people , could visit and check which are   the nicest spots in the city , events and so on . Of course , we wanted to make it different   from other similar websites , and this was the main challenge . No one of us had any   particular skill but we were all diverse in our personality and mindset , so we all had   different points of view , which can help in terms of creativity but can make it slow when   it comes in taking decisions . 

 2 . Selection 

 The tool we selected was <NAME> <NAME> ( of course , without knowing it ) . This tool looks   for patterns and insights in the data collected , and it ’s especially used when it comes   to establish some criteria and assumptions for the next steps . Since our team was   formed by 7 people with different “ personas ” , we thought that mapping would be   better to pull together what we had in our minds in a way that we could all add some   value ... some smaller idea into this project . 

 3 . Application 

 Basically , everything we did was meet and brainstorm , by trying to understand how to   develop this idea in something that was different , more creative ... and maybe   innovative ? ! We had meeting once per week and the week before we always had some   assignment like “ write down from 3 to 5 column you ’d like to have in the website ” with   no restrictions . Then , once we met we were looking at all the different proposals .   However , the main purpose of <NAME> <NAME> is to clarify what is not clear and to   converge all the smaller ideas into a main one . Unfortunately , we did n’t manage to do   it . What we had in our mind was somehow different from each other . We did n’t find a   starting point as well as an ending one . For instance , someone believed it was better to   make it more social - based , while someone else though it would be better to make it   more informational . As I learnt from Design Thinking course , when reflection and   disagreement are involved in the process , it becomes inefficient . 

 4 . Insight 

 What I understood from this experience and from what I studied in Design Thinking is   that an idea can not simply be developed . The process from idea generation to its   development is intricate . In that team , we all had good ideas but they just did n’t fit with   each other ’s . The reason why we just stopped meet after a while was that we were not   even sure what we were trying to develop anymore . When the idea is too broad and   vague , insights are way too harsh to find . 

 5 . Approach 

 Now I understood that our mistake was that we did n’t start in a proper way . Before   applying any tool , we also should have clear in our mind what we and our customers   were looking for . What is the opportunity ? What is the purpose of our project ? What is   our plan ? These basic questions did n’t have answers for us , so it ’s easily understandable 

 that this project did n’t go in the right way . Next time instead of rushing with   brainstorms and <NAME> <NAME> I would rather consider other ways to make the idea   more concrete . <NAME> should have shown us the idea using another Design Thinking   tool , like Visualization which comes in an earlier stage and helps in making an abstract   idea more real . 

 Maybe we were just nobodies … or perhaps we just needed a different approach .

"Challenge 

 I am a ladies beauty salon manager . We are working to solving one of the main problems face many of   our customer which is hair problems . The challenge was that hair problem are different and causes are   diverse . Customer have now idea how is the structure of hair and what hair needs and how to go for the   right solutions . Another problem is that most of hair stylist in salon have little ideas as well about how to   solve problems for hair . They use to wait the customer ask for a solution and they will provide without   giving the right advice 

 Selection 

 We choose to work on finding a solution for this problem by using mind mapping tool . We set as a group   of hair stylist and group of customers and we discuss about the hair problem that most customers face .   We start to draw a mind map of the main problem and main solutions . 

 Application 

 As we discuss the main problems and main solutions , we put also a plan for educating hair stylist more   about hair structure and what are the main problem most customer facing . We agreed also to launch a   consultation service that will help every customer to be close to hair stylist who will call her on a   schedule basis and give her instruction and take her feedback about improvement on hair . Every   customer will have specific file with all her information , health history and her routine care for hair and   hairstylist will create a plan to her based on her situation and follow up with her until she gets the   results . 

 Insight 

 Choosing mind mapping help us to see all points related to the problem and salutation in front of us . It   help us also to find out main points and discuss them and lauch new service to solve this problem . Mind   mapping tool is really a great tool as it helps you match all dots together and see all points from another   prospective 

 Approach 

 Mind mapping is a great tool and we get a great result of it but next time we are planning to use another   tool just to help us knows more about design thinking tools

"Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is considered as an essential human activity for sharing experiences , explaining   values , and deciding on solutions through realistic , authentic , verbal and visual accounts . My   work as social worker compels me to use it all the time it helps explain the interconnections   among people in situations and settings 

 I share stories of my life in order to help them visualize a state of independence , I use their   feedback , which is the basis of the iterative process of prototyping that led to solutions .   Stories and prototypes are intertwined , explaining and repositioning experiences through a   multitude of potential interpretations , which allow me to test new solutions before committing   to a particular decision . Help people imagine by describing in order to touch them emotionally   it ’s a way to bring change and inspire them to act , I open up to them and try to make them   open up in the other hand . 

 Application 

 When you are going through a difficult time , you need someone to be by your side , that ’s   what we are providing to our clients , by sharing true and lived events by myself or other ’s   stories . I tried to underline the fact that addressing the needs of one individual can impact   everyone around for the better . I told story about that one day when I met a girl in a laboratory   who was having a mental breakdown because she just got the news that she ’s adopted , I   stayed by her side took a cab with her to her place and get her safe home . 

 Insight & Approach   My turn to open up , I made her think that she was n’t alone and how scary this is when I grew   up in a orphanage knowing that either of my parents wanted me . I shared how difficult this   was and how she could recover . And the we discover how these different and yet so similar   stories tied up together . She realizes that it happens and had a conversation with her adoptive   parents and knew all about it . 

 I told this story in the agency and it had a magical impact to people there , stories are always   good . 

 This course made me realize that a good storyteller is a person that integrate the listener in the   story to touch them , from now on I can prepare my stories in order to assist presenting my   ideas .

"DESIGN TOOL : LEARNING LAUNCH 

 Challenge 

 I work in the education sector in my country and recently we had been   experiencing challenges in the online learning programs . This challenges include   access to internet by students who come from a less than average family , for   example some parents do not have smart phones to access online platforms ,   others have the smart phones but can not afford to purchase bundles every day to   facilitate the students learning , some have more than one child hence online   learning becomes difficult when the students are many and the phone is only one   in the family . Another challenge was lack of textbooks . This is because textbooks   are very expensive to purchase especially if you have more than one child and   none of them is in the same grade . There also lacked a connection between   teachers and their students making it difficult for the teachers to follow up on the   progress of their students . 

 Selection 

 I selected a learning launch which is a carefully designed experiment or prototype   designed to test the key underlying value - generating assumptions of a potential   new - growth initiative . It is a learning experiment conducted quickly and   inexpensively to gather market - driven data to determine whether a growth idea   has enough merit to warrant detailed investigation with the commitment of   further time , people and resources . I came up with a solution of an application   and I needed a quick and cheap way of testing it against my assumptions that it   would work so as to qualify or disqualify my assumptions . 

 Application 

 I first came up with the idea of an application that would be accessible to all via   USSD , SMS , smartphones , tablets or laptops . I then incorporated online textbooks   for all grades , revision materials , story books and engaging learning games that   would make learning more fun . I then sold my idea to stakeholders like Safaricom   Limited who gave me access to the USSD and SMS services . After coming up with   the education application , I chose twenty people across all the standards of life ,   that is the below average , average , and the above average . This in my opinion 

 would give me good quality feedback . It is also important to note that among   them were parents , students and teachers and they were all from the same   school . I then gave them access to the application via any means that was suitable   for them , i.e. SMS , USSD code , website and many others . The school was   supposed to pay a fee of <NAME> . 3,000 only to facilitate the learning of each student   or if the student ’s school was not enrolled into the program the student would   enroll as an individual at the same fee and would be able to learn just like the   others . This took place over a period of two weeks to allow enough time for the   students and teachers to interact . 

 Insight 

 From this learning launch we discovered that even the students who came from   below average families were able to log into the application and learn effectively   because the cost of SMS is much cheaper than internet bundles . Teachers were   also able to get good and effective feedback about the students ’ progress . Most   of the students and teachers were able to enroll into the program because it was   cheaper than the overall school fees that is paid on a normal term . It was also   noted that learning had been made more effective by the availability of online   books at a small fee that was cheaper than buying them at the book store . This   challenged me to come up with a more improved way of studying that would   facilitate learning in even bigger platforms and how I would use design thinking to   innovate a feature or platform that would aid in learning at all levels . 

 Approach 

 From the above described procedure , learning launch would still be the best tool   for further assessment and modification of the application .

"My Story Telling Experience 

 Challenge & Selection    Storytelling is a great tool that I use all the time . In my role , I act as a Business Relationship Manager and   every time I deal with my Business manager on one - side and Technology leaders on the other side . Both   this people have a different mindset to deal with . On one side the Business manager are more focused   on business objectives and they do n’t really care about Technology and on the other side Technology   leaders are very obsessed with technology who needs to be empowered and inspired from time to time . 

 I spend a lot of time mentoring people on technology side and finding ways to inspire them to improve   their circumstances . When I work with Business leaders , we share stories for different reasons . Often   they are happy to share stories of their lives with me to connect and they find meaning in sharing these   experiences . I use their feedback against the context of my story to ascertain their goals , and sometimes   we use stories to better understand their interests and thought processes . 

 I use this information to develop different strategies , which might bring both the sides on common   page . 

 Application    I have a story about using storytelling . Technology requirement from business leaders shared very   briefly and they expect it to deliver as early as possible . On the other side technology leaders needs   more clarity to provide realistic timelines . Therefore , as a BRM I always make both the sides understand   the challenges on either side by some story telling . 

 Insight & Approach    For the business user I always try to listen more and link my story to give them understanding of the   efforts that will be required by IT and on the other side , I talk about Business urgency by making some   story on Business need that can have impact on our Business to deliver solution in Agile and quick way . 

 Listening to Business leader story and linking our story to their journey helps to build the repo and make   them realise the real effort that goes in developing something and sharing putting our IT expert in the   imagination of they generating impact on business value motivates them to achieve this goal with   excitement . 

 Simple stories sometime makes a big impact and story can be used for people to realize their own worth   and value others worth as well .   It ’s a great tool that I always use in my day to day life to even mentor   people and motivate them 

"
"Challenge   The challenge that I am currently being faced with , is the challenge of delivering a complex   message to a broad audience . In collaboration with the local municipality in my city , we are   trying to host an event that aims to make as much children as possible build a climate sensor ,   all at the same time . Within this project there are many stakeholders such as the local   government , local schools , children , their parents , and other companies and organizations that   are willing to collaborate with us for this event . The message we need to spread in order to get   all these stakeholders on board with us is complex because it needs to fit everybody ’s beliefs   and attitudes towards our goal ; creating a sustainable city by implementing sensors that   measure and analyze local climate .    Parts of this challenge are ; 

 1 ) We need a very specific way of communicating with all the stakeholders mentioned 

 above to make sure they get the message and get on board with us . 

 2 ) Making sure that the message sounds somewhat urgent because we want to create 

 awareness surrounding climate change . 

 Selection   The selected tool that I selected was storytelling . The reason why storytelling , in my opinion is   the best tool for the challenge I described is because of the fact that a good story tends to stick   with people , and messages can be sent in a very specific way . In week 2 of the Design Thinking   lectures , storytelling is described as followed ; Put the human beings and their experience front   and center . Take the listener along on their journey .    Me and my team utilize the same philosophy ; we want to create a message that makes people   see that they are the center of the project ; without them it ca n’t be realized . By creating a   message that speaks to them in a very personal way ; they realize that it ’s them that forms the   biggest part in our journey to a sustainable world .      Application   What we did in order to apply the storytelling tool in a strategic way , was to create the message   we wanted to spread with citizens . In our opinion , the message could only reach citizens if they   actively participated on creating the message . We got some volunteers on board that helped us   create a message for all the other citizens . A major benefit of this way of working is the fact   that there are no boundaries within the message . What I mean is that if we would not create   the message with local citizens , we would not know their need and their way of thinking ,   regarding our project . What we could ’ve done better , was to get other corporations and   companies on board to create the message as well . We wanted to create a community of   citizens and organizations , but only citizen helped us create the message . We are now trying to   get people from organizations on board to help create a message that focuses on   companies / business as well .      Insight   The biggest insight that me , and the other project members got is the fact that if you want to   set up a broader community for a specific event , you need to get people on board from   organizations as well as local citizens . Also , when I finished the first version of the message we 

 created , I sent it to all the other project members to see if they have things they wanted to add   to the document . The biggest insight in that for me is that project members always keep   coming up with relevant extra information regarding the project you are working on , in my   case ; a clear message to initiate an event .      Approach   The next time we initiate a similar project we will focus more on getting businesspeople on   board that represent organizations / companies . The reason for this is because besides utilizing   open innovation , they could also become sponsors of events that we want to host in the future .   What I also would do different next time is to get people on board that have a lot of   experiences in the field of storytelling . I would seek people that work on similar projects that   already created compelling messages in their past . It would be good to have specialized people   on board .

"<NAME> 

 I am a part of a small yet developing project about Russian culture that is called   ‘ kesyov ’ ( ‘ our ’ — in Russian ) . To share our research and projects with the society we   use different social media : such as Instagram , Telegram ( popular web - channel    for sharing your thoughts and ideas in <ADDRESS> ) , Facebook etc .     In order to widen our audience coverage we decided to create our own website   and that was the point when the big challenge appeared : How exactly will it   look like and why ? What will be the graphics like ? What will be the tone of voice   with which the website talks to a customer ? How can we become closer to oua   audience etc ) .    After a session of brainstorming we realized that to create a ‘ Russian ’ website we   need to understand what ‘ <ADDRESS> ’ is in terms of words , tags , pictures , drawings ,   images and so on . However , our team is very small ( only 3 people work on this   project ) , which means that just our personal answers to those questions will   be not enough to create an exact common image that is required .   To achieve the best result that is possible we ’ve decided to ask our viewers   ( potential and existing ) to actually visualise ‘ What is <ADDRESS> ? ’ in their opinion . So   we will be able to analyse this data and create something that is based on the   general statistics . We did this little game - challenge at the one of our free - en- trance exhibition . We created a ‘ drawing corner ’ with the necessary materials   such as sheets of paper with the text of the task ( ‘ what is <ADDRESS> in your opinion ?   1 ) Draw 2 ) Write 3 ) Visualise however you want ) , markers and special tape to   make sure that after people have completed the task they can share it by placing   their work on the wall , so other people ( and our project team ) can look at it and   analyze it .

 ( 02 )   APPLICATION 

 As I said before , we played this game with our viewers at our exhibition   which was located in the library . There we showed our works which were rus- sian - themed posters , paintings and videos about our local regions features . People came there , looked at some masterpieces which were presented and   than listened to a presentation about “ kesyov ” , where we spoke about who we are ,   what we do and what is our main goal . This presentation included some inter- action with the audience , so after it was done viewers began to feel much more   comfortable on this event . In our presentation we also mentitioned this ‘ game ’   that we biult up , to make sure that the most of our visitors will take part in it .    During the exhibition people were constantly coming to that drawing corner   and expressing their thoughts and ideas about the topic . When ‘ kesyov ’ exhibition   was officially over , we took all paper sheets off the wall and started analysing it . 

 ( 03 )   INSIGHT 

 ( 04 )   APPROACH 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 The way people depicted their subjective images of <ADDRESS> was remarkably   diverse . However , we were managed to identify particular common tendencies .   Firstly , among other colours , red and grey were prevailing . Most frequently red   was associated with <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> in <ADDRESS> , national costumes , and war , while   grey was about dullness of Russian cities . Secondly , visitors who expressed their   feelings about <ADDRESS> in a verbal form tended to use non - official vocabulary . For   example , local jokes , personal conversations fragments or popular quotes from   Russian movies . These observations lead us to the insight : in order to become   closer to our audience , we should , metaphorically speaking , give them the floor ,    hear them and than be able to speak the same language . For instance ,   for the   basis of our website we will use red and grey colours and a friendly , informal   tone of voice . 

 As for the graphic decisions , the great diversity of visitors ’ answers did n’t let us   come to the choice of a certain visual language . This made us conclude that the   next design tool that we should use is ‘ Mind Mapping Tool ’ which will help us to   classify data better and come up with some new beneficial insights .

"Storytelling for AMC 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Selection described in general The tool I used was storytelling for the small & medium enterprise AMC to make a new   business model in tourism in <ADDRESS> understandable and actionable for all stakeholders , also   globally . Storytelling is a great tool to convey meaningful messages that inspire stakeholders to   engage . 

 Challenge description The challenge was , that the business model is novel , unique , complex and therefore hard to   understand for customers , inhabitants , partners , employees , contributors , shareholders and   suppliers . It contains a property portfolio with rentals to business and residential customers , design   holiday apartments , hotels that also offer services such as laundry , take away and delivery ,   housekeeping for business and residential customers , attractive purchase services for other hotels   and restaurants , a marketing and sales ofﬁce , different online sales channels , several restaurants   and some experiments to try out new offers . 

 As fundamental part of every successful brand , I used the storytelling tool for being able to put the   human beings and their experiences with AMC in front and center , to tell them a compelling ,   understandable and comprehensible story that ensures emotional connection to all stakeholders to   get their engagement . 

 Personal selection reason I have selected the storytelling tool because there was a misunderstanding from inhabitants ,   employees and other stakeholders of AMC and I was sure that telling a consistent story   would help people to better understand it . 

 Additional resources I also refer to the following additional video sources : Ty <NAME> , How to combine story and action to transform your business , <NAME> , 08/07/2013 <NAME> <NAME> , How great leaders inspire action , <NAME> <NAME> , ( Start with why ) September 2009 <NAME> <NAME> , The secret structure of great talks , <NAME> <NAME> , November 2011 

 Application 

 Put the human beings and their experience in front and center We started with gathering a deep understanding of our wide audience by collecting all statements   and feedbacks we heard during the last years from customers , partners , employees and   inhabitants and read comments on booking platforms , in local newspapers , correspondence such   as emails and complaints etc . We worked intensively on the characters and values of all   stakeholders who use AMC offers , services and infrastructures daily . Therefore , we used   empathy maps for every stakeholder group to connect deeply with what they hear , see , say , think   and feel and what their gains and pains are . 

 Subsequently , we looked at trends such as the sharing economy , challenges in Swiss tourism   regarding falling prices and weak utilisation of the whole infrastructure . We then looked at these 

 topics in the AMC customers perspective by using customer proﬁles and a value proposition   design mindset ( Value Proposition Design , <NAME> <NAME> , 2014 ) . 

 Deﬁning the Why , how and what We ﬁrst deﬁned the Why , the purpose of the AMC platform , which includes the challenges   AMC faces and the reason why the current stage is much too dangerous in todays   <ADDRESS> tourism state . When we had found the reason why , we started to deﬁne the How ,   which principles the company had to follow by all actions it takes and last but not least the What ,   deﬁning all the experiences ( front stage / customers ) and activities ( back stage / company ) that have   to be delivered on a long term . 

 I like to work with that structure as a framework for addressing what will be needed that customers   and all other stakeholders can connect to a sequential , understandable and meaningful storyline . 

 Brainstorming and adding ideas , testing the storyline with customers We brainstormed and added new ideas and iterated the whole story several times . Consequently ,   we tested the storyline with several stakeholders . The story is about 1.5 pages long , starts with   why , continues with how and what . The story contains the challenge and why the current state is   too dangerous than any change . The tensions from todays state to the future state are addressed .   It is written in topic clusters from the customers perspective . The CEO and also the staff can tell   the relevant parts to their stakeholders and explain it more detailed along concrete actions . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Focusing on deeper customer insights Usually , business customers like AMC want to quickly see results . This is why I started the   story with all customer insights we had already gained at that point . What I would do next time , is   to better convince the customer that with more and deeper customer insights , the story will become   even more compelling . 

 Learnings We discovered new and unknown things during the process of developing the story . We also   learned , that the focus of the story in the AMC customers eyes was a bit different than in   Ferienlenks perspective regarding the structure , priorities and also the wording . The AMC   CEO pitched the story on every occasion like employee events , local community meetings ,   shareholder meetings , partner events and also tells it with contributors and suppliers . From now   on , he was easily able to link the stakeholders to a consistent story . 

 Relevant outcomes The story was understood by all stakeholders very well . Not only the story was appreciated , but   also supported and conveyed to the public by the stakeholders itself . It did put the owner in a   comfortable situation to argue in a very clear way and put through his interests . One example was ,   that he did not sell a property located on a AMC strategic site to a local milk seller that   absolutely wanted to buy it . Instead , he convinced this partner by delivering the messages using   the story to rent the building and moreover , to become a shareholder of AMC .

"Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your   brain . Mind mapping is a creative and logical means of note - taking and note - making   that literally "" maps out "" your ideas . 

 <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> have some things in common . They have a natural organizational   structure that radiates from the center and use lines , symbols , words , color and images   according to simple , brain - friendly concepts . Mind mapping converts a long list of   monotonous information into a colorful , memorable and highly organized diagram   that works in line with your brain 's natural way of doing things . 

 One simple way to understand a Mind Map is by comparing it to a map of a city . The   city center represents the main idea ; the main roads leading from the center represent   the key thoughts in your thinking process ; the secondary roads or branches represent   your secondary thoughts , and so on . Special images or shapes can represent landmarks   of interest or particularly relevant ideas . 

 The great thing about mind mapping is that you can put your ideas down in any order ,   as soon as they pop into your head . You are not constrained by thinking in order .   <NAME> , throw out any and all ideas , then worry about reorganizing them later . 

 There are many great mind mapping software programs out there to help you organize   your thoughts and then automatically export them to an easy - to - read , ordered list . 

 While it is absolutely possible to mind map the old - fashioned way with a pen and   paper , why not take advantage of the technology age and save yourself some much   needed time ? 

 The mind map is the external mirror of your own radiant or natural thinking facilitated   by a powerful graphic process , which provides the universal key to unlock the    dynamic potential of the brain . 

 How to Make a Mind Map 

 • Think of your general main theme and write that down in the center of the 

 page . i.e. Food 

 • Figure out sub - themes of your main concept and draw branches to them 

 from the center , beginning to look like a spider web i.e. <NAME> , <NAME> ,   Breads 

 • Make sure to use very short phrases or even single words 

 • Add images to invoke thought or get the message across better 

 • Try to think of at least two main points for each sub - theme you created and 

 create branches out to those

"Coursera Assignment for Design Thinking Submission 

 1 .   Challenge   I am an educator and I teach business communication at a polytechnic in my country . Usually   at the beginning of the semester , one of the key things to be taught is that of the Purpose- Audience - Context ( PAC ) components . Understanding the Purpose of the communication   situation , who the Audience is , and the dynamics of the relationship between speaker / writer   and listener / reader will determine the tone , register and content used . My students are 16 - 17   year - olds , who are fairly good in the English Language , but not necessarily communicatively   competent . I usually tell them that being good in a language , does not make them good   communicators . <NAME> lies the pedagogical challenge – how to get young students to   appreciate the PAC of communication so that they are sensitized to the requirements of a   communication context , and be more effective communicators . 

 2 .   Selection   I teach across many schools in my institutions – Engineering , Design Arts , Engineering ,   Business . My teaching approach is never a one - size - fits - all thing . I am given leeway to vary my   approach and in one semester , I decided to adopt a learning launch by experimenting a new   and creative method to teach PAC , and fine - tuning it if need be . Rather than leaving this PAC   at the theoretical level ( just explaining the abstract concepts ) , I felt it was necessary to get an   experience of a simulated communication encounter . I would then get feedback from   students through their post - activity reflections on what they learnt while doing the activity . 

 3 .   Application   For each class , I divided 20 students into 5 groups and assigned each group one of the   following communication challenges :   ( i )   Explain the difference between RAM and hard - disk storage to a non - techy elderly   person 

 ( ii )   Explain the offside rule in soccer to a person who is watching a game for the first   time 

 ( iii )   Convince an anti - vaccination parent why his / her child should get vaccinated 

 ( iv )   Convince a meat lover why his diet may be harming the environment 

 ( v )   Explain “ birth control ” to a class of 10 - year olds 

 Each group was given 30 minutes to research and think how best to carry out the task . A   group representative had to role - play and enact the actual encounter to the class acting as its   audience .     Subsequently , in later classes , I varied the scenarios a little to suit the disciplines of the   students ’ diplomas . Not every group was able to adapt their communicative strategy correctly   to the right audience . For example , when a student had to role - play explaining techy concepts   to a non - techy senior citizen , he continued to use computer jargon – basically communicating   from his own perspective , rather than the audience ’s perspective . My point in this approach   was not to have the students come up with the best communication strategy for each   situation , but for them to appreciate the intricacies of each situation , and the empathy   needed to understand the challenges on part of the audience to understand the intended   message . 

 The feedback from the post - activity reflection showed that many of them finally understood   that linguistic competence alone did not always lead to communication success . From the   reactions of the class , I also sensed a higher level of engagement and involvement in what   would otherwise have been a dry abstract lesson if this activity was omitted . 

 4 .   Insight   By applying the learning launch in this pedagogical experiment , I had actually deviated from   the lesson objective of that <NAME> 1 of the module which was to just introduce the objectives   and overview of the module . Through the first experiment , and checking on their students ’   reactions and reflections from the activity , I felt I had moved from teaching them ABOUT   communication to showing them the communication process .   I also told my students after   the activity that I honestly did not think all of them was going to get it right ( although a few   did brilliantly ) . Doing a learning launch requires a Growth <ADDRESS> , daring to try , and fail , and   re - trying again . 

 5 .   Approach   An alternative approach could be to use the Visualisation Tool to develop a pedagogical   approach .   By getting educators to think in terms of the various possible communication   encounters ( parent - child , seller - buyer , friend - friend , young - elderly ) and come up with ways to   teach students extrapolation strategies in the communication encounters they find   themselves in , we will generate a form of visual thinking in our students .

"Design Thinking Course from University of Virginia Assignment 

 Challenge   I am the founder and CEO of an organization into training and consulting . We work on some niche   areas like DevOps and SRE ( Site Reliability Engineering ) , which today is one of the most sought - after   skill - set in the IT industry world - wide . We started our operation from 2012 and by 2017 , we realized   we need to start building our brand . To do this , one of the ways we chose was to have a DevOps   Summit .    In <ADDRESS> , there is a lot of Agile , <NAME> and some DevOps related tools conferences which happens   including the vendors like AWS and Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud . However , even though there   is a lot of people doing some good work in these areas , there is no good DevOps conference . Even   world - wide the best is the DevOps Enterprise Summit .   To be able to reach to this large community of DevOps and SRE practitioners and provide them with   a world - class knowledge - sharing platform , wanted to start the DevOps India Summit .   However , as I had no experience of organizing any event , wanted to take the Learning Launch   approach in steps .   There was also an objective from the business point of view . As the Brand name is built , in longer   run it will generate more business for the training and consulting . This is a derived objective .     Selection   So , I went through the approach of creating an experiment . I organized a small event of around 35   senior management invitees and had one expert speaker from <ADDRESS> to conduct a session over   webinar and also conducted a experiential learning game on DevOps for the audience and ended   with a high - tea .   From this event , I got the feedback that it was very useful and they wanted a proper conference on   the topic as there is no such event in <ADDRESS> . Everyone encouraged me that they want a good   conference where “ Learning ” was very important , sharing experience with peers and networking   was important .   I tried one more experiment . I again invited now a few experts and leaders in the area from various   organizations in <ADDRESS> and organized an event in <ADDRESS> where 135 people registered . This event gave   me the validation of my hypothesis that there is need for good learning platform for middle and   senior management in the area of DevOps , SRE and people are ready to pay for such conference if   the speakers are good and there is real knowledge sharing .    Then we went ahead to move to the main event of DevOps India Summit to be held for the first time   in 2018 . We still needed various other aspects to be validated like the Sponsorship , bringing the   founders and stalwarts of the topic as speakers for the event physically , organizing the event and   promoting the event to get a sizeable number of participants and speakers .   This is what now I understand is what being told in the video of the Learning Launch for creating the   hypothesis and testing and also on the concept of the 4 questions – What Is step .      Application   Based on our learning from the two events , which was part of the What Is and defining the   Hypothesis for the test and then getting the data from the actual participants , we went forward to   collect further data . This is about getting the truth . We wanted to get more confirming and more   specifically disconfirming facts . As we want speakers from abroad , we needed to find out first of all if   they even want to come to <ADDRESS> for my event , what it will take to bring them . I had someone I know   who has good connections and another expert speaker and author . I spoke to them and a couple of   senior leaders who also supported me in <ADDRESS> . I got to know that I have to have at least 350   participants in the audience for these speakers to come , I need to do it in a good hotel and   auditorium , I need to have proper social media promotions and Press Release to get good speakers   who in turn will attract Sponsors . Even though as a first year , I could not pay the fees the speakers 

 generally charge , I need to pay for their business class to - and - fro travel and stay .   I had a small event   in 2017 and here the scale is suddenly much bigger . I also needed to get many more speakers and   have to have good topics and speakers .    I already had some idea and now with secondary research like that of IBM video , I interviewed quite   a few speakers and sponsors and senior management people .     Insight   Based on the above experience of the small events and the interviews , we got a lot of insight . We   got confirmation that organizations and individuals are eager to pay and attend a good conference   with good speakers and better still if they are the stalwarts of the area like <NAME> <NAME> , etc . We also   understood that we need to have it world - class quality and then only the speakers will come and   based on the speakers , the sponsors will come and the delegates will register .   With the help of my contacts , got the initial 4 to 5 speakers from <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . We started a   Call for Speakers and based on the initial submission of 30 submissions , we had selected 20 to be the   selected speakers in the main conference . We went and spoke to many organization after creating a   brochure for sponsorship and got a few sponsorship , being the first year . We engaged an event   management team to manage the event from registration to setup , audio and video recording , etc .   My team kept learning from the various activities and kept delivering on the website , brochures ,   agenda , etc . We also learnt that there will be situation where a speaker may not be able to come for   some reason and we had to be ready for it . We needed to get subscriptions for Flickr , Vimeo to   enable sharing of photos and videos with the participants . We had to book the hotels for stay and   during the event the food and other expenses like wifi for the speakers and booths . Even though we   plan with the knowledge gathered in the application stage , we still find certain challenges when it   actually works like some booths wanted to have theirs placed in a different location or there is some   technical glitch delaying the program by 10 mins , etc . These learnings was useful for the 2019 DOIS .   Due to our learning launch approach , we already knew what are the “ Wows ” like the speakers , the   setup required for the event , the post event production , the importance of good location and food ,   having people option to interact with these global experts with no “ Purple Tape ” and also some fun   elements like gifts and games and photo booth .     Approach   As we were new and we started with the approach of Learning Launch . This gave us the desired   result and we did not need to have any alternate method . Looking at the goal , we had a great event   and in 2019 we already saw anyone who is into DevOps and SRE across the globe knows about the   event . This also is bringing new business for my organization . Many stalwarts are now requesting to   be a keynote speaker in my event and have delegates coming from various parts of the world .

"Design Thinking for Innovation Course Reflection : Storytelling 

 By <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge    One of the biggest challenges I face as a Project Manager in the technology industry is keeping   my Clients on the same page as our internal development team , especially in the face of   problems that need to be solved . It can be difficult to find the right balance between over- sharing and collaboration within the Client - Consultant relationship ; you do n’t want to “ cry   wolf ” too early or often , but you also do n’t want your Clients to feel blindsided when a problem   arises that they did n’t see coming .      Specifically , I found when the need for an increase in budget ( e.g. <NAME> <NAME> ) would arise ,   many of my Clients did n’t understand where the need was coming from and it immediately   created distrust that more budget was being requested without a clear understanding of how   we got there . Upon further reflection , I realized that in an effort to present ourselves as   Consultants who had a plan for solving every issue before our Clients were even aware the   issue existed , that I was leaving them out of the entire process of collaboration and problem   solving .     Selection   While there is a temptation as Consultants to only “ put our best foot forward ” in front of our   Clients and shield them from an issue until we have a solution in mind , it became clear that this   approach does n’t foster understanding – especially when the challenges result in the need for   more funding . I realized we were n’t bringing our Clients along for the journey . With this in   mind , I started thinking of ways we can better “ show and tell ” to Clients through the ups and   downs on projects , while still maintaining a productive relationship . The power of storytelling is   an excellent tool to help find this balance . As noted in the course videos , “ It ’s not about a to - do   list ; it ’s about connection ” – and <NAME> is the vehicle for that connection .     Application   As a way of finding a practical way to start <NAME> with my Clients , I rolled out a project   RAID ( Risks , Assumptions , Issues , Decisions ) Log and requested that we prioritize reviewing the   list once a week with Clients . It was imperative that I did n’t just email this list , but instead we   set aside time to “ story tell ” and talk through it front to end so there was both understanding   and co - ownership of risks , assumptions , issues and decisions . This created open communication   to take Clients on the journey with us for all the potential issues I was seeing on the horizon ,   but also proactively talk about potential solutions before issues became a reality . Within the   RAID Log , we would link to reports and projections and use real - time data to help story tell   where we were at and where we were going . In many ways , the seemingly simple review of this   RAID Log provided the foundation for honest collaboration that allowed us to evaluate the hard   data I was seeing and align that to risks and mitigation plans .     Secondly , as also noted in the training course , true <NAME> can only happen when a clear   sequence of events can be followed from beginning to end . With this in mind , we also started 

 including our Clients in our Sprint Planning meetings in which we created Stories and spread   those Stories into Sprints so the <ADDRESS> could visually see what the path forward looked like . This   was imperative to our <NAME> because it allowed the <ADDRESS> to be a part of the planning   process , but also identify risks with us as we were planning together . Previously , we had   conducted these meetings internally . Conducting these meetings with our Clients allowed them   to see how tasks / bugs were laying out across Sprints , how the timeline and budget were   panning out , and ultimately gave us the chance to tell a story of how we saw this working or   not working – and then it gave our Clients the change to become a part of that story early on by   providing us with input and seeing what we were seeing from the get - go .      Finally , if and when an increase in budget or timeline extension was needed , we leaned again   on the data we were gathering from the plan we created . We could calculate Sprint velocity to   help us project whether or not we were going to meet our target . Giving the <ADDRESS> live access   to these reports ensured they always knew where the project was headed .     Insight & Approach   Once I instituted this new approach of transparent “ Storytelling ” with my Clients , and we came   to a point where we needed to extend our project timeline to accommodate some issues we   had encountered , my Clients were much more open to it than they had in the past . In fact ,   there was one <ADDRESS> who pointed out the need for a scope extension to me before I even   approached them on the issue because they had been a part of the <NAME> and following along   with us from the beginning through the use of the RAID Log , ongoing Sprint Planning every 2   weeks , and live reporting . Through the power of <NAME> , the conversation with our Clients   shifted from feeling like a timeline / budget extension was “ happening to them ” to them   proactively managing risks and issues with us , and ultimately allowing the conversation to focus   on solutions and options .      Ultimately , the level of engagement , passion , and collaboration went up despite challenges   because both Clients and Consultants were on the same page of the <NAME> and aware of how we   arrived at both problem and solution .

"Reflection - Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I was asked to structure a manual of procedures for a company providing event planning   services . The services of the company required the engagement of many people from inside   and outside of the company . This requires a satisfactory cooperation of all the parties and   the clear understanding of each one who is in charge for each task and with whom has to   communicate to solve or clarify any problems or concerns , accordingly . The drafting of a   manual of procedures is assumed to save time and energy for the employees of the   company and the partners who collaborate with them . The total of people who need to   access the manual of procedures is 22 . The time in which the manual should be delivered is   2 months . 

 Selection 

 The tool I chose to implement , in order to gather the information I needed , is Visualization .   The reason this tool seems to be suitable , for this project , is that the potential users of the   manual come from different working environments and the jargon of each one differs .   Amongst the 22 persons were marketers , financial assistants , technicians , artists and other   operational officers . Visualization provides the depicting of the reality in a way that it   does n’t need any more explanation in words . The images and the sketches used in   describing the situation help find patterns and explore how the parties feel and experience   the situation that they describe . The decoding of the images will be done in a common   language and the manual will include mainly images and visual presentations . 

 Application 

 First , the 22 people formed 3 teams . The first separation of the people occurred on the basis   of the criteria if they were internal or external users of the manual . The 8 internal   stakeholders – staff of the company formed the one team and the other 14 persons formed   the other team , which was separated in two sub - teams of 7 persons each . The task of each   person was to depict the daily routine of his / her colleague who was appointed for each one .   To facilitate the process I gave them some predesigned common characters , items ,   furniture , equipment , activities and some plain papers if something was not included in the   predesigned . They had to combine in the draft board , all these parts , based on their   observation of what is the routine of their colleague . 

 In the second phase the 22 people formed 3 teams on the basis of the work flow , as it   emerged by the first phase . The application was the same as described in the first phase , and   the predesigned sketches were amended and enriched according to the ones came from the   first phase . 

 The first reaction of making “ handicrafts ” and spend precious working time was an obstacle   that we had to overpass . The predesigned sketches may bias the participants but in the   second phase the parties were more familiar to the process and made their best to depict   the situation on a broader scope and not limited only to the sketches given . Also , they were   given the choice to use their own photos or sketches to facilitate the visualization of their 

 routine . One more difficulty was in the following stage when I had to use a common   language to present the manual . Also , they were given the choice to use their own photos or   sketches to facilitate the visualization of their routine . 

 Insight 

 In the end , the parties seemed that enjoyed the procedure and there were times they felt   more like a team and had fun . In addition , some of them expressed empathy for the   colleague they had to observe . Regarding the difficulty of presenting the outcome of this   process , in order to be sure that the procedures will be clear to everyone , the manual was   visualized by the most common sketches and the graphic designer of the team managed to   depict the greatest part of the manual . 

 What I learned from the Visualization Tool is that it is worth to try to implement it and insist   on challenging people to contribute in the scale they feel comfort . During the process , most   of them will enjoy it and the more they practice it the more they enjoy it . Also , it was very   interesting that they had to collaborate and put themselves in their colleagues ’ shoes . This   experience made them more tolerant of their colleagues . 

 Approach 

 If there is any case I could implement the same tool , I will choose again the visualization   tool .   This time I could add more visual features such as video , more photos , more comics   and any other mean that may make this process more enjoyable for the participants .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch      Challenge    I am a lawyer in an insurance company and a member of a project team . Our challenge is to create an   online portal for buying and servicing insurance . The scope of the project includes sales , product ,   marketing , customer service , IT and legal affairs , consisting of 10 people . The project is based on   internal resources of the company . The duration of the project should not exceed 6 months . We will   focus on creating such features and capabilities for the portal to be customer friendly and   understandable , easy to use , build relationships with customers , and increase insurance sales .   Creating a portal is also a challenge for my compliance department .      Selection    Our team choses the learning launch tool as quickly test an idea and prototype .      Application    In the first phase of the project , after weeks of brainstorming about the look and function of the web   portal , a prototype of the portal was created , which was subsequently subjected to a detailed   assessment within the project group . The visualization of the portal has made it possible to spot a   number of errors and imperfections that remained unnoticed during the portal discussion phase .   Visualization of the portal was also an excellent tool for graphical and marketing refinement of this   project . And finally visualizing and analyzing the path of the customer buying insurance in this portal   allowed us to refine all legal requirements .    In the next phase of the project , the portal ( in the limitation to its core functions ) was subjected to   testing among non - project staff of our company . We collected their evaluations , comments and   experiences . This allowed us to focus on improving the portal to meet the needs of an external client ,   and to detect a number of errors in this portal .      Insight    By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified our assumptions and designed launches to   test these assertions . We expected that using this tool will allow us to refine the project and eliminate   bugs in the portal during its testing phase , while also checking the reception and affection of   customers . Our results did not surprise us , although there were too many computer errors . This will   allow us to make future adjustments to the design work so that such errors will be avoided in future   projects .      Approach    Our team project needs to review the insight gained from our first learning launch and incorporate this   insight into future launch designs . Future launch designs should reflect insight gained , progress made ,   and come closer to a compelling solution ready for full rollout .

"Reflection- <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 In order to increase revenues and better position ourselves in the market , it´s important that we   continue to please our customers , in both service and product range . This will ensure we are   better placed to compete against new entrants in the market , and that we can maintain / increase a   price premium for our products . Our current understanding of customers needs / wants is fairly   limited , and customer knowledge is concentrated to a few individuals in the sales team , whereas   the business development team who develop new potential products have limited customer   empathy . The challenge is use increased customer empathy to generate ideas for new products   and services . 

 Selection 

 The tool selected was <NAME> <NAME> . This tool was selected because it quickly and easily allows   insights about customers gained through previous works with other tools ( storytelling , etc ) to be   shared with the whole team and used as a springboard to generate new ideas . It is the segway   from understanding of our current state ( “ what is ” ) to an innovative business development   pathway ( “ what if ” ) , and is perfect for a multi - disciplinary team . 

 Application 

 Data collected in using previous tools in the design thinking methodology was spread around the   room in which the workshop was carried out . The workshop was run over half a day , and featured   a multidisciplinary team , including commercial , operational , new product development , logistics   and strategy team members . Participants were invited to discuss current state “ what is ” , with the   assistance of the information collated , and share experiences to give a common base of   understanding from which to generate ideas . 

 Participants were then given post its notes and asked to give a “ first burst ” of ideas based on the   material displayed in the room and the initial discussions . This was done in the “ silent sharing ”   mechanism , whereby participants write down their ideas in silence , and then afterwards share   them with the rest of the group . These post it notes were then placed up on the wall , with a   couple of very basic pattern groupings based on whether the idea related to new products , or   services . 

 Next , participants were asked to choose at random a couple of post it notes of ideas from the wall ,   and try to further develop these ideas , and draw connections between different ideas ( e.g. a new   product and a new service ) to create compound ideas of increased value . The new ideas were then   placed back onto the wall , along with the original ideas . A couple of extra round of idea generation   and development were carried out . 

 As a second stage , to group the ideas into more definitive themes and to assess the timeline of the   idea ( i.e. short term , medium term , long term ) the group was reduced to a couple of core 

 members to represent the key stake holding departments , with several facilitators . The facilitators   helped the stakeholders to rapidly categorise each of the ideas , and replace them around the   room based on their categories . In later stages the ideas of highest priority ( based on impact and   effort of implementation ) were developed into projects for rapid prototyping and implementation . 

 Insight 

 I found the tool very interesting and useful , having the information collected in advance and   spread out over the room gave real depth and added useful insights to the idea generation . I think   that both the quality and quantity of the ideas was increased because of the supporting material .   More broadly , this tool demonstrated to me the value of the design thinking process , following the   various stages of “ what is ” to “ what if ” and then in later stages going through “ what works ” and   “ what wows ” . 

 When using this tool I also found a lot of value keeping in mind the idea of the “ growth mindset ” ,   and this is one of the key aspects that I aim to keep thinking back on in future work . 

 Approach 

 If I was using the tool again I would send out relevant information to the participants in advance to   give them more time to absorb the “ as is ” information , as this time in the workshop was a little   more limited than ideal due to time pressures and the desire to get to the idea generation session .   I would like to try out sending information ( gathered through tools such as visualization and   storytelling ) one piece a day for the week leading up to the workshop , as I think this would build   up anticipation and generate interest and excitement , and also give the participants more time to   think of ideas in advance .

"Assignment :    Visualization   Reflection    Submitted   by :   <NAME> <NAME>    Course :    Design   Thinking   for   Innovation      Trail   Challenge :   To   Build   or   Not   to   Build      An   environmental   charity   wanted   to   conduct   a   fundraising   campaign   to   raise   $ 4   million   to   build   a    public   path   in   a   busy   tourist   area   of   a   small   town   in   British   <ADDRESS> ,   <ADDRESS> .   They   had   been   gifted   a    large   piece   of   land   by   a   local   landowner ,   which   was   a   substantial   gift   and   prevented   them   from    needing   to   purchase   the   land ,   however ,   they   still   needed   to   raise   a   large   amount   of   money   in   order   to    pay   for   the   supplies   and   labor   to   build   the   trail .       Even   though   the   local   community   appeared   to   be   supportive   of   the   trail ,   they   could   not   provide    enough   money   from   private   donations   to   build   it .   If   the   summer   vacation   property   owners   did   not    provide   some   funding ,   then   there   was   a   strong   possibility   that   they   would   not   raise   enough   money   to    complete   the   trail .   The   charity   did   not   know   if   the   community   as   a   whole   would   support   the   project    and   needed   to   conduct   testing   with   key   influencers   and   potential   donors   to   gauge   their   interest .    Building   the   trail   without   testing   the   support   first   was   too   risky   because   the   charity   did   not   have    enough   money   in   reserve   to   cover   the   cost   of   the   trail   if   the   fundraising   efforts   were   not   successful .       Tool   Selection :   Visualization      Visualization   is   the   process   of   “ assembling   scattered   ideas   into   a   compelling   story   that   can   generate    vivid   mental   images ”   ( Designing   for   Growth ,   p49 ) .    As   the   consultant   for   the   study ,   I   chose    visualization   because   the   charity   had   a   firm   concept   of   why   they   needed   the   trail ,   how   it   would    benefit   the   town ,   and   how   much   it   would   cost   but   needed   a   persuasive   way   to   tie   it   all   together .   The    business   case   for   the   project   was   strong   but   without   a   tool   to   help   them   illustrate   how   the   trail   would    positively   impact   the   residents ,   there   was   little   chance   people   would   donate   enough   to   meet   the    budget .   We   needed   a   tool   that   provided   a   “ head   and   heart ”   message   to   convince   people   to   support    the   project .   Visualization   provided   the   perfect   combination   of   key   messaging ,   beautiful   photography ,    architectural   renderings ,   safety   data ,   and   budget   criteria   to   create   the   vision   for   the   project   in   an    easy‐to‐read   document   that   was   only   four   pages   in   length .   Visualization   allowed   us   to   describe   the    urgent   and   compelling   need   for   the   trail   in   a   succinct   and   tangible   way .       Application      Once   we   drafted   the   vision   document ,   we   worked   with   the   charity   to   identify   a   list   of   people   whose    opinion   would   be   important   to   the   success   ( or   failure )   of   the   fundraising   campaign .   The   list   included    past   and   potential   donors ,   key   influencers   in   the   community   such   as   large   landowners   and   business    owners ,   affluent   summer‐only   residents ,   and   elected   officials .   We   requested   one‐hour   meetings   with    all   of   the   people   on   the   list .   If   people   did   not   want   to   meet   with   us   in   person ,   which   was   often   the 

 case   with   the   part‐time   residents ,   we   offered   to   conduct   the   meetings   by   phone .   When   someone    agreed   to   meet   with   us ,   we   emailed   them   the   vision   document   so   they   could   read   it   in   advance   and    prepare   their   questions .   This   created   a   good   environment   for   an   informed   and   candid   dialogue .      While   the   scheduling   of   the   interviews   was   in   progress ,   we   designed   a   questionnaire   to   guide   our    discussions .   Consistently   using   the   questionnaire   ensured   that   we   covered   the   same   questions   with   all    the   interviewees .   The   goal   was   to   speak   with   20   –   25   key   influencers   in   the   community   and   gauge    their   interest   in ,   or   opposition   to ,   supporting   the   fundraising   efforts   for   the   trail   as   either   donors   or    campaign   volunteers   or   both .   We   successfully   met   with   24   interviewees   and   compiled   the   feedback    into   a   summary   report   along   with   recommendations   for   the   charity .   The   entire   process   took   three    months .      Insight      Fundraising   and   design   thinking   both   require   a   willingness   to   adapt   and   fail   fast .   Good   fundraisers   are    responsive   to   their   donors   and   design   thinking   serves   as   the   perfect   platform   to   plan   and   launch   new    fundraising   initiatives ;   it   is   an   ideal   methodology   for   solving   complex   philanthropic   issues .   We   are   not    formally   taught   design   thinking   models   in   fundraising   classes   but   they   should   be   added   to   the    curriculum .       Although   it   is   not   explicitly   stated   in   the   course   videos ,   it   occurred   to   me   that   both   fundraising   and    design   thinking   are   rooted   in   communication   and   relationships   and   both   are   iterative   processes   based    on   testing   and   investigation .   The   elusive   synergy   between   art   and   science   is   as   beautifully   illustrated    by   design   thinking   as   it   is   as   inherent   in   daily   fundraising   practice .        Improvements   for   Next   Time      Visualization   was   an   effective   tool   in   this   circumstance   and   I   would   use   it   again   in   a   similar   situation .    However ,   it   would   also   be   enlightening   to   create   a   journey   map   with   a   wide   spectrum   of   people   from    the   town   because   there   were   many   assumptions   made   during   the   visualization   process   about   how   the    trail   would   be   used   and   what   benefits   would   be   desired   by   the   tourists ,   local   public ,   and   sponsors .    Journey   mapping   would   have   confirmed   the   validity   of   those   assumptions   and   supplemented   the   data    gathered   during   the   interviews .       The   other   tool   that   I   would   use   next   time   in   conjunction   with   visualization   is   storytelling .   I   would   take    someone ’s   first   hand   account   of   the   situation   and   create   a   short   video   to   showcase   the   urgency   of   the    project   or   program   from   his / her   perspective .   A   link   to   the   video   would   be   included   in   the   email   about    the   interview   along   with   a   PDF   of   the   vision   document .   I   think   this   would   provide   a   holistic   micro   and    macro   perspective   to   the   exercise   and   spark   some   interesting   conversations   in   the   interviews .

"Learning Launch 

 I choose “ Learning Launch ” as my favorite discussion topic .   While there are thousands of idea generations   leading in to plenty of “ potential opportunities ” , but they are <ADDRESS> until proven to be   a successful product   or solution . In learning launch , the process of testing the idea through various steps offer insight on the   success of ideas , whether it confirms or disconfirms with the original intent . 

 What is ? 

 Being a Product Manager , I get inspired by plenty of ideas when customers share their pain points or   industry expectations of products & services . My job is to take those feedbacks , study each one of them ,   improvise selected ideas and translate them in to products / services . These products / services must be a   viable business growth possibility and generate enough revenue , profit , as well as customer satisfaction   to sustain . 

 What if ? 

 My evaluation of ideas includes quantitative and qualitative data analysis , design study , technological   constraints , and production and supply chain challenges . Financial viability and commercial success of   products / services evolving from these ideas draw management scrutiny . So , I do lots of theoretical ,   practical , and field tests to fully understand how my prototype product / service performs and fulfills its   original intent . It must be also of superior solution , lower risk , and competitive in cost . 

 Once we decided to launch a single use Paper Cup product for hot & cold beverages . This to eliminate   plastic cups and make consumers to use environmentally friendly , bio - degradable paper - based cup . 

 What Wows ? 

 I did a thorough field research on the benefits , cost valuation and technical challenges .   It gave me lots of   insights to establish requirements of such product for consumers . Then I decided to make samples or   dummy cups to test from functionality point of view with diverse teams . 

 My production team made some samples of paper cup to be tested among with our internal team and   selected customers to get their feedback . I made sure that test teams were diverse to understand the   functionality of paper cups while filling , consuming , handling - both hot and cold beverages for consumers ,   until it gets to recycling bins . 

 What works ? Learning launch in action … 

 We then gathered plenty of feedbacks , insights and confidential surveys that were mixed with pros and   cons of a paper cup to replace plastics . Based on the feedbacks , user analysis , tests , and evaluation . We   made necessary design / functional changes . We also compared our sample paper cups with industry   competition to see how our Paper Cup competed with existing industry acceptance levels , in terms of   being a fully functional and sustainable product . 

 Applying learning launch concept to test the value generation assumption of a new growth opportunity   gave wider insights about the product expectation without risking bulk production which may have been   rejected if not for the proto type approach . 

 We did couple of more samples and tested with consumers and improvised to make it a best product   suitable for its purpose . We then scaled it up for mass production for global consumers . 

 Every product launch helps me to apply Design Thinking principles to cover the whole process chain and   thinking strategies at multiple levels . It also helped me and my team to be innovative and competitive to   understand customer ’s expectations empathetically to offer right solution .

"Storytelling in designing 

 <NAME> telling has been always a good means of communicating with the audience to attract them   to concepts of designing and innovation . Designers usually use the storytelling to get insight   into users , establish prominent empathy and reach them productively . Designers establish   personas to produce their target users and add relevant social issues to stories that reflect their   hard - work ,   journeys and problems . While crafting stories , designers can make better   understanding what users want from solution . 

 <NAME> telling creates an realistic like environment in the designers to influence their attention .   It helps in forming cognitive imagination to compare the story with the realistic values . The   creativity depicted in the form of story - telling is itself a form of good communication to   outsource information . 

 The story teller should be an area expert with few successful stories to attract the designers   towards innovation .

"Reflection , Visualization 

 Challenge 

 As System Analyst in a <ADDRESS> company , I once joined a team to enhance the complaints resolution   processes of Customer Services area . The customers throughout the country would call at the call   center to register their complaints regarding <ADDRESS> services they use . Customer Service Agents at   the call center would fill the complaint sheets manually and , at the day end , send these complaints   to the Exchange for technical resolution . The exchange was in the same city but at a distance . Once a   complaint is resolved , the Exchange would send the information back to the Customer Service .   Finally , the agents at Customer Service would inform customers about the outcome of complaints . It   means that even the first response to the customers would follow atleast after 2 to 3 working days   of the complaints registration . 

 It was a semi - government company and hence Customer Services and Exchange were headed by   different heads and had their own Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) . The challenge was to build   a common understanding of the new business process flow , which may not comply with some of the   strict protocols of the SOPs , but should provide a faster response to the customers and thus improve   customer service . 

 As we proceeded with initial meetings , I realized that though the desired functionality of the   proposed system was well discussed , and the stakeholders were clear what the new system will do .   But they did not have a common understanding of how the new business processes will look like and   who will do what . The later was utmost important so that every department could incorporate it in   their SOPs . 

 Selection 

 While we had Process Flow Diagrams and Flow Charts to depict the flows within the processes but   there was no way to show the inputs and outputs of the processes and most importantly who does   what . 

 We began to use activity diagram to create the business process mappings to cover “ what ” , “ from   whom ” and “ how ” the information will flow into and out of the system . The purpose was to leverage   the capabilities of activity diagram to cover all aspects of the new business process . This includes the   actors , the information and the processors . 

 But I realized that alone activity diagram is not enough to cover everything in a single visualization . 

 I took a different approach and selected to use the concepts of use cases and activity diagrams in a   single visualization . These two models are powerful in that they not only show the relationship of   the actors with the processes but also depict the process details at activity level . 

 Hence , they allow to build a good understanding of the complete picture of a single business model . 

 Application 

 I began to show the inputs and outputs of the processes and who does what . The later part was   important to all since every stakeholder wanted a clarity on doing his part in the entire system . So , I   combined the concepts of use case and activity diagram to create a new model that could cover the   actors and key activities in a single visualization . Then , taking the timing concepts from sequence   diagram , I added the categorization of entire model to show the boundaries of customer service ,   technical , and supervisory areas . Thus , we avoided switching among multiple diagrams to show a   complete story . 

 Since this new visualization borrowed few concepts from different diagrams , hence I was concerned   how will the audience react to it since the finished diagram adhered to none of the standard . At first   instance , the unfamiliar style of the visualization created a mixed response in the audience . But I   took a little time to explain the principles and the basis why I used the unstructured model of the   visualization to some extent . 

 Finally , with a little time and effort , everybody in the audience began to quickly grasp the scope , key   activities , actors , and above all the who will do what . The model was also accepted to become the   base of formulating the new SOPs . 

 Insight and approach 

 At first , we were stuck in using the existing visual models and tried to strictly adhere to them . As   soon as we shifted our eyes to adopt a more robust model , which would not necessarily comply to   the existing standards but would aid gaining a complete picture of the proposed flow , we discovered   that free thinking and allowing the elements of unstructured modelling to the art of visualization   brings great results . 

 Though we should strike the right balance in going unstructured and at the same time not losing the   meaning which we intend to depict through the narration .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am an employee of my company ’s Business Development department and my / our challenge is to   improve the leads & existing business ( activities and projects ) within the department in order to   increase revenue in the BC channel and to optimize productivity on the right projects . The project   scope includes the strategic initiatives department composed of 5 employees , as well as the larger   operations department and IT department , with whom we work closely . The project is limited to   internal resources ( i.e. , budget and employee time ) . The project should not exceed 90 business days   and the solution should include an even distribution of working hours amongst the team members .   We will focus on trying to uncover what our team members , as well as key stakeholders within the   larger operations department and IT department , consider to be ineffective or problematic with   regard to the workflow . 

 Selection 

 The internal team has already gone through several design thinking sessions / tools , so we are ready   to try the learning launch tool . Apparently , the learning launch is a small experiment to quickly test   prototype and an idea . 

 Application 

 The initial learning launch involves , we focused on the structure / execution of our operational tasks .   In particular , the team wish to monitor if we could structure our tasks , projects , and processes to   adapt the methods of BC project management for our work ( e.g. , time taken , weekly , any specific   meetings , reviews , etc . ) in an effort to become more productive . This tried our assumption that the   hierarchy and implementation were the main reasons of our workflow challenge . Our team went   through a crisp training with a operational project management coach .   As a Next step , we went   through five workshops to structure our tasks and processes in a more meaningful way . These two   sessions happened within in a 2 - week timeframe . We expected to produce a document with a clear   description of our new , more revised workflow . For our second learning launch , we focused on   gaining clarity about our priorities . This tested our proximity that our prioritization of tasks was the   main cause of our workflow challenge . The team completed an anonymous survey . Along with that ,   five key stakeholders from the larger marketing department and IT department also completed an   same kind of survey . The surveys included questionnaires regarding our advanced , proposed   workflow , conceptual understanding the process and the prioritization of tasks , and feelings about   the change , and were conducted within a one - week timeframe . 

 Insight 

 The team identified our assumptions and designed launches to test these assumptions by learning   launch tool . In addition to that , we thought through anticipated results , expecting to find that a   more productive approach would improvise our workflow , and that both our team and the partners   would be interested to the new internalization of process . 

 The on ground results were insignificantly different from what we expected : while our team was fine   for the prioritization of tasks and process , the partners in the operations department and IT 

 department expressed some issues . Going forward , The internal team will review this insights and   implement it into any future launch designs . The on going incorporation of insight is particularly   important at this stage , as launches come before a full rollout in the design thinking timeline . 

 Approach 

 Although our team has already reviewed several design thinking sessions and are at this stage in the   timeframe , the learning launch is the suitable tool . As previously mentioned , our team needs to   review the insight gained from our first 2 launches and incorporate this insight into future launch   designs . Future launch designs should mirror image insight gained , progress made , and come closer   to a compelling solution ready for full rollout program .

"Description of the challenge . 

 The tool I 'm going to use is storytelling . The challenge I plan to address is how to keep declining oil   assets globally from experiencing a catastrophic abandonment process , as seen in many   unconventional fields in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , in the year 2020 . In the coronavirus crisis , hundreds to   thousands of wells are poorly abandoned and are releasing hundreds of thousands of tons of   methane into the atmosphere , worsening greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere . Design   thinking is needed to address such problems as it involves not only   big and small operating   companies , but environmental authorities perform control tools , where abandonment and   decommunication operations are done even in a scenario where oil and natural gas exploitation is   no longer feasible . 

 The history of oil exploitation is more than 150 years old with conventional exploitation and 180   years with unconventional exploitation with gas wells already drilled from shale gas and oil since   1821 in <ADDRESS> . The use of natural gas has since enabled the heating and night lighting of   hundreds of households with another appliances with a huge expansion of gas use has continued   to grow until December 2018 , where solar panel and offshore wind technology are already   cheaper than the cheaper fossil alternative , understood as coal thermal , in European Countries .   This turning point points to a breaking point with global energy management where it is   understood that business - based renewable energy can already replace fossil energies . The lack or   absence of abandonment activities can be a potential environmental disaster with more warming   effect at the atmosphere in the decades to come . 

 The other breaking point in process is the use of cheap or nanotechnological materials for the   construction of batteries for storage and/or electric automotive . The Massachusetts Institute of   technology   MIT in August 2020 publishes that it has been successful with the experimental design   of sodium batteries in replacement of lithium batteries , which are expensive and their use is very   limited by the material scarcity of this element on earth . When advances in renewable energy   costs in conjunction with advances in the manufacture of batteries with low - cost materials are a   commercial reality , the oil industry as such would experience rapid or slow decline , which as a   result would leave an environmental liability of methane emissions , a greenhouse gas 32 times   more potent than carbon dioxide . 

 Once the oil industry faces a crisis where oil use is much lower than today , the management of oil   and gas assets should be aimed at leaving the least amount of oxide , waste and wells flowing   uncontrolled in rivers , lakes or soils .   That 's why this problem is what requires design thinking the   most where everyone involved is part of this solution . 

 Application of the solution . 

 The use of natural gas in abandoned wells has been a very strong habit in communities near the oil   fields for more than 80 years . Under this reality , the story to tell about poorly abandoned wells is   that many communities can benefit for much longer than conventional gas exploitation in   abandoned oil fields . The story to be told is that communities must be trained in the use of low- potential wells under safety schemes and oil and gas well abandonments must be carried out by 

 the same oil and gas companies , or in any case fields must be ceded to companies purely engaged   in field dismantling and using soft technologies ( untrained wells , portable drainage of oil wells . ) 

 Communities can organize the way in activities whose low - pressure gas input can be used as raw   materials such as brick manufacturing , and building materials , an activity that will still require the   use of fossil fuels in many more decades to come , as soon as there are no low - energy alternatives   to conventional building materials . 

 The use of story telling is to educate communities on the safe use of gas in wells about to be   abandoned , but whose gas flow can be for decades to come . 

 On the other hand , non - productive but explosive wells must be effectively abandoned and   monitored by the environmental liability of oil spills caused by poorly abandoned wells . 

 There must also be an education for governments and local authorities to have technologically   capable equipment to replenish us for decades or hundreds of years because the problem of   abandoned wells will persist for hundreds to thousands of years . 

 The use of patents ( low cost abandonment practices ) to make an economic abandonment should   be an effort in design thinking derived from a widespread storytelling effort and within the   framework of the oil industry as a whole , because very few people know in depth the   environmental problem arising from frequent ruptures of abandoned wells . 

 Vision and Focus . 

 The use of TED or RSA presentations for the dissemination of such problems is a moral imperative   for environmental authorities in any oil and gas - producing country . Also , it is necessary to speak   with magazines and website about giving adequate dissemination of data , to warning people ,   government and communities to avoid contamination from wasted oil and gas fields . 

 The communities in my own country are rural villages and has an extremely low level of formal   education and must be used comic based material to explain a very complex technical problem . 

 The future history of the environmental liability of abandoned wells should be told to companies   to governments and to communities in such a way that there are : 

 1.A massive abandonment of wells well done at the end of their productive life . 

 2 . Prevent a very hasty decline in the use and price of oil from implying catastrophic   environmental liability for future generations . 

 3 . The low - cost use of a declining asset for the use of low - cost industries , such as brick   manufacturing or its use as local energy for high - dispersion industries such as farms . 

 4 . Reuse of wells such as water - supplying wells or for water pouring into confined aquifers   currently used under environmentally safe conditions . 

 5 . Use of low cost technology for safe and cheap abandonments . 

 6 . The formulation of new low - cost abandonment technologies that are more permanence than   current low durability steel coating sealing technologies . 

 The history of bad abandonment has been told several times by the Colombian and world media ,   with completely degraded areas , such as <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ( a lake with continuous spills from   abandoned producing areas ) and areas of soils with high salinities such as the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> in <ADDRESS> . This approach has caused abandonment activities to accelerate , but they have   the implication that the public image of oil companies has been greatly damaged . 

 A company with a very bad image in the long run represents that the political cost of a bailout is   unlikely and all outstanding environmental recovery activities are compromised in a 20- to 30 - year   scenario where oil and gas have no economic value . 

 That 's why the abandonment process is not a long - term problem , but a problem that there are   only resources to solve in the small window of opportunity where oil companies are still profitable   and have technological support and equipment to do the right thing with wasted oil and gas fields . 

 What needs to be done differently is that abandonment activities are not solely the responsibility   of operating companies but that there is fiscal control of all the actors of the problem , as   mourners and responsible for the action in the abandonment of oil and gas fields in the world .

"REFLECTION ABOUT VISUALIZATION TOOL 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In my Engineering life , it is a challenge for me to visualize compounds or scenarios to 

 answer specific problems . Just like in design thinking , when you are trying to start your 

 own business , you must visualize different aspects of it like pros and cons . At first , it will 

 be tough but if you practice or make a thorough research , it will result positive outcomes 

 and avoid possible mistakes . This will also practice your mind in design thinking taking 

 considerations all factors . 

 Application 

 I used the visualization tool in making my business which is production of dishwashing 

 liquid . I forecast the possible outcomes of starting this business starting from the good 

 up to the bad scenarios . After listing those possible outcomes , I make back up plans to 

 overcome different problems . This tool is helpful for me because I could avoid errors on 

 making the dishwashing liquid and prepare a better one . By using the tool , it also 

 enhances my ability in problem solving which does n’t only apply on business but also in 

 our daily activities . 

 Insight and Approach 

 Visualization tool is very effective when you are starting your own product or business . 

 This is a basic step on your preparation to consider the dos and don’ts of your product . 

 The specific step that you will take will be based on your visualization tool and further 

 researches . Everyone do their own imagination by building a successful company and 

 with this imagination is one of the components of building that successful company . This 

 can enhance our memory skills and visualization skill . It will be helpful to forecast the 

 future of your product for improvement and lessen the delays or problems . 

 In my business , I still find the visualization tool useful . I still use this for further 

 improvement and will be highly recommend to those acquaintances who are planning to 

 do startups .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I work for a software development company which has implemented an agile 

 methodology for development . Sometimes I am the product owner and I need to communicate to the scrum team which are the goals and objectives of app or piece of software we have to develop for the customer . Most of the times are apps which have two flavors , the customer and the provider side . On every scrum sprint I need to transmit the big picture to the team , the expected outcomes for the users , the calls to action , expectations . 

 Selection 

 I have found story telling through user stories to be the best way to transmit to the 

 team what the customer wants and how the users will use the app , how they will be feeling about it and which needs/ issues the app will solve for them . Specially important is why they need the app . 

 Application 

 First is to define the project area creating a positioning statement which should include 

 who will use the app and the need the app will help to fulfill and how the app is different from other apps . Then the “ personas”are identified and a detailed persona profile is 

 written . This profile needs to detail the tell story of the individual , who is , what he / she does when facing a situation the app will solve . What he / she thinks , sees , feels , does . 

 Then some scenarios are created with current alternatives and a value proposition the 

 app will give . 

 With this a user story which flows out from the persona is created for the first sprint 

 and storyboards are created . 

 And for following sessions child stories derived form this user story are created to 

 continue the app development . 

 Insight 

 With user stories the scrum team identifies the objectives of the project , and they feel 

 engaged as they understand the needs , and feelings of the persons who will be using the app . It really generates an impact on the team and also the customer . When the customer is invited to the meetings and hear and sees the stories , feel pretty confident the project is in good hands . 

 Approach 

 Right now we are only using storyboards to tell the stories . It will be nice to start testing 

 with some videos where the scrum team will be the actors of the stories . In that way the will internalize in a better way the feelings and needs of the users .

"SKILLBUS- VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge & Selection 

 We are in a very fast changing world in terms of technology , geopolitical alignments , innovation ,   market expectations and many more . Ever changing world needs unpresented skills to survive ,   making unlearning - learning - relearning a pressing requirement to be addressed . As a learner and   student , myself , I have experienced this first hand that there is a gap between what you learn in your   college , on the job today , becomes irrelevant in a few years creating a void/ gap in the skills needed   to solve current day business problems . Therefore , the challenge I am considering is , “ How might we   create a mentoring framework for continuous skilling to meet existential professional needs ? ” . 

 A learner is always , finding it difficult to find a suitable mentor , unclear about the stated credentials   of mentor that is not verifiable , wondering which mentor has updates skills aligning with current   business/ technology trends , concerned about lack of participation from industry practitioners as   mentors & worried about the economies of acquiring new skill . 

 From a skill learner perspective , as a student myself , I thought thinking visually will give a high - level   overview of the learner and his/ her environment , opportunities for learning , modes of learning .   Also , I thought visualizing the impact of the outcome is also important to determine the means of   learning/ coaching . So , I am selecting one of the Design Thinking technique , Visualization to get rich   understanding of the context , actors involved , scenarios , situation , and actionable insights . 

 Application 

 I applied the <NAME> technique to EXPOLRE the overall skilling environment . Listed all modes   of alternatives that skill developers are adopting . Broadly , I could notice that choices are based on   the location of learner , technology access he/ she has and ability to invest in skill development ,   based on the expected outcome . I found that the learner approaches had a particular PATTERN of   selecting the sources for training like online training portals , green field trainings , coaching centres ,   self - study guides , offline learning material and one - on - one mentoring . 

 I then IDEATED these approaches with a couple of my classmates , to find the most suitable   framework for skill enablement . We then were able to create a framework in shape of a matrix for   skill seekers to be able to select the right and most optimal approach to get skilled . 

 We then used this matrix as a PROTOTYPE framework and asked a few of other friends to try it out . I   would say in a way we PILOTTED the approach with a small group to get feedback from them . Our   intention was to SCALE this up and test with a larger group . We collected the data/ information   about their experiences , challenges they faced , suggestions they had for improvisation and rapid   prototyping . 

 In our visualization frame of mind , we had the trainers , learners , modes of training , criteria for   learning skills , skilling economy ( investment vs. ROI ) , various situations in which a learner perhaps   could be and what would the learning journey of each kind of learner . We had a framework that was   ‘ usable ’ but not very effective or optimized . 

 Insight & Approach 

 I realized that we need to restate/ extend the problem statement as , “ How might I improvise the   framework for rapid and effective skilling , to meet marked demands and within the constraints ? ” 

 I further explored other Design Thinking methods and I have decided to use few other Design   Thinking tools like , PERSONAS and JOURNEY MAPPING to understand the needs of each learner . We   realized that the learners come from various back ground , maturity levels , varied affordability ,   appetite for technology , etc . , . We have decided to use INTERVIEWING technique for gathering   insights from every actor in the scenario for a given situation , to understand the skilling ecosystem   and improve the efficacy of the framework further comprehensively .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I am part of Special Initiative team who responsibility is to deliver projects with most impactful manner . My role as a client servicing manager is   to deliver each & every deliverable with an impact for all stakeholders . I am also responsible for the customer retention & customer delight for   all our initiatives . Our upcoming global conference People Matters TechHR will have 150 + Partners & 3000 + employees where my role as a   Client Servicing person is very critical as we have to manage 150 + partners and at the same time we have to make this conference most   impactful for them in terms of ROI . 

 Selection 

 We have already created many tools using Design Thinking to help Delegates , Partners and other stakeholders who will be coming for the   event . Broadly speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea and prototype . Some of the tools which we created   and tested during TechHR SG ( Previously held conference in <ADDRESS> ) were : 

    Exhibitor Manual for partners vendors 

    Pre Event Badges distribution for partner internal delegates 

    Communication toolkits for partners to circulate within their network and many more … …… . 

 Application 

 A Learning Launch is just the title we 've given to a small experiment . 

 As mentioned above , there were several experiments we did during TechHR SG , many of which worked in our favors and others we call them   learning and not failures . One of our successes in managing our partners was to create Exhibitor manual which we created to help our partners   & partners stall vendors . Exhibitor Manual had all the relevant information at one place , be it <NAME> , <ADDRESS> , Setup timings , Vendor details ,   Security information or any other small yet very valuable information which partner should aware of . 

 Insight 

 We first use secondary research to answer the “ what is ” question , and turn these insights into specific design criteria while making the Exhibitor   Manual . We brainstormed solutions with different stakeholder in order to take diverse opinion and then focused in on what wows to surface   assumptions and then to prototypes that began to test them by sending the drafted manual to our own vendor and taking his feedback &   Perspective . 

 And then answered the final question , what works , by conducting a learning launch ( Exhibitor Manual ) 

 Learning Launch for me is : 

    Launching into the Unknown 

    Identifying process ( How to do it ) 

    Key customer execution and defensibility assumptions .. 

 Approach 

 As previously mentioned , our team needs to review the insight gained from our first launch ( which was a success ) and incorporate this insight   into future launch designs . If a learning launch does n't work , so long as you 're learning , it 's not a failure , it 's not a mistake . Create small diverse   teams to do the experiments . Mitigate confirmation bias . Do n’t restrict yourself with quantity and quality of data . Be Innovative . Future launch   designs should reflect insight gained , progress made , and come closer to a compelling solution ready for full rollout .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I work in a computer consulting firm , in the industrialization area , where we are only two   people , since it is starting to grow . In this area we are in charge of implementing tools and   methodologies in the different projects within the company , that is to say , we work in a   transversal way to help the teams work more efficiently , eliminating dead time and waste that   give us value to the process . 

 We want to make ourselves known , that the different teams of the company look for us and   feel the need to carry out improvement activities , to help them in their work . Currently we are   the ones who go directly to each of the teams to show them the different activities we do ,   tools we offer and methodologies that can be useful to implement . It would be much more   interesting to make Design Thinking known and to be able to implement it in the teams , so   that it becomes a new way of working and changing their mentality . 

 Selection 

 I have chosen Learning Launch because it is a very useful mechanism to turn an idea into   something real , also because it allows us to do many quick and cheap experiments , because   we throw ourselves into the unknown , to bet on something that we do not know how it will   end , but with the hope that everything will go well and because if it goes well or badly , we will   always learn something new . 

 Application 

 The first step was to conduct research to answer the question , "" What is ? To explore the real   situation of each of the projects , which allowed us to identify the different needs that each   project had , in order to have a solid base when determining which tools or methodologies to   apply in each case . 

 Then we converted the ideas into specific criteria , by means of brainstorming workshops , in   the specific case of a project , great ideas were obtained by gathering the whole team ,   identifying a list of ideas and then with the mind mapping we identified patterns that led us to   more creative solutions answering the question "" What wows ? We performed quick tests   implementing different work methodologies such as Lean , Scrum , Agile , to identify which one   best adapted to their needs , also with tools such as Clarity , SharePoint , JIRA , among others   that were a support for task management . We also took advantage of training activities in new   methodologies such as Design Thinking to attract their interest in new ways of working . 

 Finally , we had to define What works ? Through the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , where a table is created   with each of the assumptions of all the activities we did , workshops , brainstorming , mind   mappins , training in other methodologies and tools , which helped us identify which worked   best , which were more attractive to the teams and which obtained faster and cheaper results . 

 In this way the teams are already looking for us to support them in each of the processes and   activities they carry out to obtain good results , on time and with the least possible waste . 

 Insight & Approach 

 I have learned the importance of Design Thinking in our way of working , in the amount of   options it offers to carry out an idea to its end satisfactorily . 

 They are an excellent ally when working with such different teams and people with whom I   have to work every day , because every project has its own needs , and each person works in a   different way . 

 It gives us a focus to identify what really matters , to eliminate what does not bring value and   that generate barriers , and focus on a faster learning , collaborative and that makes us feel part   of the process , that we are a team .

"Challenge     While I was studying at my business school in <ADDRESS> , we got the chance to follow a six - months   project to learn some skills on how to launch our own businesses . It involved creating teams of 5   to 6 persons and then finding a great idea and preparing everything for the launch . On the last   day of the course , we would be due to present our project with a solid business plan and a 15   minutes ’ pitch to 400 others students and a jury of professionals ( BNP Paribas , L’Oréal and so   on … ) . Only 10 teams among the 65 participating would be allowed to go on stage for that   presentation , a selection from the teachers would take place two weeks before to pick up the best   projects . With my team , we faced a hard time choosing an idea , most of our propositions were   nice or funny but none of them was relevant to help our potential future customers solving a true   problem .      Selection     We decided to talk about our everyday lives with my 5 team members and to tell each other every   time one of us was facing a problem or had faced something difficult in the past to see what ideas   could emerge from that . We did n’t know the name of that tool at that time but we were using the   storytelling tool . We had to find interactive way to share our stories with the other team members   to get their attention and then we were using the outcomes of those stories to brainstorm .      In the end of the course , when we got selected among the 10 best teams and allowed to go on   stage , we got to use that tool again to create an engaging story to pitch for the final presentation .      Application     Two weeks before the start of this entrepreneurial course , my father died from a cancer . I was   back in school because I did n’t want to miss anything but my mind was somewhere else . I just   knew one member of the team personally ( and she knew what had happened to me ) , the other   ones were just student I could have seen in the corridors , nothing more .      When we decided to apply the storytelling tool , at first I did n’t want to speak about such a painful   personal experience . I did n’t feel safe enough with the other members . We kept telling each other   stories for 10 days , meeting once a day , but none was bringing us a powerful idea . When I began   to feel a bit more confident with my team , I decided one day to tell them about my father ’s death . I   was very sad at the time because my father grave was 10 hours by train from my school and   even by plane , the shortest way to go there took me 8 hours . Also , I was thinking about what the   body of my father could become in that grave and it scared me a lot .      Everyone listened very carefully to my story because the subject was tough of course but also   because almost all the team members could identify with it . If it was n’t a father , they had lost a   friend when they were a child or a grandmother and could barely go on the grave more than once   a year because of the distance and because of our nomad lives . For instance , during my   business studies , I happened to live in 4 different countries . When you ’re abroad , you ca n’t visit   your family ’s graves easily and sometimes it may make you feel sad . We realized we had the   start of an idea there . Six months later we were on stage , presenting our diamond made of   human ashes to the jury . We were offering a new way to think about death and to keep our   beloved ones near us . Also , we liked the idea of permanence that a diamond brought . Thanks to   storytelling , we could explain how this tough personal loss gave us a great idea and how this   project helped me ( and the others ) to see death not only as a reminder of all the bad things but   also as an opportunity for creativity .       Insight 

 Thanks to the storytelling tool , we got to know each other very quickly as we were telling our   personal stories to the group on a daily basis . It helped me feeling at ease to bring my personal   experience about my father ’s death and we then realized we all echoed in a way to that   experience . That was the starting point of a great idea but also a great adventure that lead us   until the final presentation .      Also for that final day , the help of storytelling was crucial . Our idea was n’t an easy one to   introduce and we knew many people may be shocked by it . Explaining how this idea happened   and how it helped me to go through that experience moved the audience who was then more   receptive to accept such a disruptive way to deal with death . When we tackled the business plan   part , everybody was listening carefully because their attention was hooked by this storytelling   technique and I can tell you silence was not a common thing during that day .      Approach     I would definitely keep the storytelling tool but next time , I would try to create a secure climate   from the start for everybody to dare sharing its personal stories right from day one and not from   day 10 after getting to know each other because in this project we had six months so it was   alright but in a shorter one 10 days might change a lot . Also , learning how to present well this   project for the final presentation was crucial to my career . Every time I am going to a business   interview , the recruiters are amazed by this story and ask a lot of questions about it . Of course ,   this is because it was n’t a common project but also because I learnt how to introduce it in a   catchy way that engages the person in front of me and questions its relationships to death and   memory .

 Ten months ago , I decided to move from my secure executive position at a public company , to embark on   a risky start - up adventure . I was hired as Director of Development and Operations in the company that   runs the contract for the e - bike Operations network in <ADDRESS> ( <ADDRESS> ) . I was responsible for the   operations , the business development and the R+D+i activities . My assignment was focused on running   the change management of the organization to scale it from the start - up approach towards a sustainable   and growing business .   The former CEO , the entrepreneur who started up the business , had left the   company some weeks ago due to different problems and had been substituted by a new CEO , the CEO   who hired me . The point when I arrived was twofold , on one hand solving the technical and logistics   problems of this new product - service ( <ADDRESS> was the first city in the world with a full e - bike system , and   the beginning had been very rough ) , on the other , setting the bases to growth so as to win future public   tenders of bike systems in other cities . As far as I understood my new position , it was a must for me to   build , in the very first place , a high performance team aligned around a clear challenge and develop , as   well , a design thinking approach . Moving towards a stable business required deep changes in technology   and people management . 

 Selection Selection Selection Selection 

 There were some different ways to tackle this challenge . Eventually , I decided to build a STORY to align   the team around a new business model focused on how to grow the company   as we helped <ADDRESS>   citizens to move in a sustainable , cool and easy way . Now , after five months of work and taking into   account the learning I 've got through this course , I know I chose a right way to face the challenge . 

 There were , as well , some interesting tools that I guessed were suitable to face the challenge in that   environment . I had read two books about design thinking that inspired me . The first one was   Designpedia , written by J. <NAME> and R. <NAME> , founders of the Spanish Design Thinking company   Thinkers Co. , the second was Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation , written by Idris Moote , founder   and CEO of Idea Couture . The first book is a gathering of 80 tools and a way to face the design thinking   processes based on the Two Diamond model of the British Design Council . The second book shows a   specific methodology to apply design thinking for the strategic Innovation . According to Moote 's point of   view "" Design thinking helps structure team interactions to cultivate greater inclusiveness , foster   creativity , deepen empathy , and align participants around specific goals and results "" . Moote sets as well   in this book some interesting links between Design Thinking Solutions and Business Challenges . There are   two of them that I adopted to face my new assignment . The first one is the link between Growth and   Storytelling because "" Growth Needs a Strategy , and Every Strategy Needs a Story "" . The second one links   Change to Sense Making as a way to anticipate the change reaction . However , both of them are actually   related with <NAME> as a way of leading change and growth based on shared sense   making and   people alignment . Whether I can   create a cause that "" ignites and unites "" old and new people , old and   new approaches , around a new strategy , I thought , I will able to move the company towards a sustainable   and growing business . And the key for this , as told us <NAME> <NAME> ( Mars Inc ) in the course , is : making   strategy simple and relate - able by a <NAME> to share experiences and ideas , and to join everybody around a   cause . Thus I thought , let 's build and share a <NAME> about how we contribute to the sustainable urban   mobility of people . 

 Application Application Application Application 

 Once planned with my CEO , I began the process asking the Company logistics team and the Company   maintenance team for their experience with the clients at the e - bike dock stations in the street . What   they saw and listen in their day to day was included in an Experience Log . Just after that , a Project team   leaded by the product development engineer went out to the street so as to apply a <NAME> tool in   order to understand in a better way the behaviour of our clientes . Divided in small subteams , and riding   our own e - bikes , they followed our clients in their journeys from the undock of the e - bike , along the   journey , until they dock the e - bike .   All their observations about the problems the clients found , were   added , as well , to the Experience Log . Finally , we took advantage of some targeted surveys that had been   carried out by the city council about the service during the first months . All that stuff has been crossed   and discussed along the last months to create a story that could be our CAUSE . Along the last three weeks   ( taking advantage of the Darden Course ) , I tried to improve our way of building a common <NAME> and   finally we count on what we call the THREE BACKBONES of OUR STORY : 

 •   Backbone one ( based on the customer point of view ): “ The e - bike customer in <ADDRESS> needs ( job   to be done ) because ( insight )   •   Backbone two ( based on our way of facing the weak signals and the unarticulated needs of the   future sustainable mobility ): “ Our company is able to ( job to be done ) so as to solve   ( unarticulated future mobility needs )   •   Backbone three ( based on the shareholders point of view ): “ Our Company wants to address ( job   to be done ) so as to meet ( strategic needs of our shareholders ) 

 It ’s important to stress that visualizing the <NAME> has been one of our main tools to move in the right   direction . I have been guessing on my way the importance of , not only telling the story , but build it with   our hands as well . That ’s the reason because we have been using the tool LEGO ® Serious Play ® as a way   to visualize what we talked about . I decided to use this tool ( I ’m certified to use it in team coaching   processes ) to unblock some difficult situations . To be perfectly honest , it took us a lot of time to align   both , our backbone two and our backbone three . All of we were aware of the articulated needs that   became in backbone one , but talking about the unarticulated needs and about the shareholders needs   were really uncomfortable and difficult . The “ old team "" of the Company thought that their point of view   was , unquestionably , the right point of view in all cases . 

 The <NAME> that we built and we share everyday is supported now on the fusion of the three backbones .   What we are , what we work for , the reasons of our continuous improvements in logistics , management   and engineering are focused on the three of them . Our Story collects elements added by almost every   person of the team . And we keep adding nuances to our <NAME> everyday so as to keep it alive and fresh . 

 Insight Insight Insight Insight     & Approach & Approach & Approach & Approach 

 Along the process I ( We ) discovered some relevant isuess : 

 •   The using of metaphors has emerged as a powerful way to express our approach to the backbone   two . I can talk about one that describes perfectly the change based on the way that a bike is   ridden ( and driven ) , and that is a significant part of our <NAME> : “ If we do not want to fall , we have   to keep moving . When we ride the e - bike , we do n’t drive the bicycle with our arms , we drive the e- bike with our look . The place where we look at , that 's the place we go . So let ’s lift our head and   look ahead ... looking what 's to come is essential to keep us from falling . Sometimes the path lies   behind a curve , so it is necessary , not only looking at , but also imagining the curve to perform it   properly ”   •   This experience was a great eye - opener about the power of visualization . As coach , I knew about   the power of working with hands to express unarticulated ideas , but in this case using the tool   LEGO ® Serious Play ® as a visualizer has become a head start for building our common <NAME> . 

 •   I guess now that my assignment is a strange fusion between "" building something new and control   something that already existed "" . As Catalina Davies says when she talks about managers   trapped in growth gridlock ( and I know now after experienced it along these months and after   this training ) ,   my   position holds an "" irreconcilable tension "" between both focus points . It ’s really   difficult to combine the operations running , with the leading of the development . How can I   launch and test new technical prototipes or new ways of e - bikes distribution whether at the same   time I have to take care about figures and revenue ? How can I evolve the operations culture to a   new design thinking culture ? How can I solve at the same time puzzles and mysteries ? For some   of my staff I am “ only ” the Operations director , worried about figures and efficiency . For others   I 'm an engineering developer , worried about improving the technical aspects of our product . And   what about my vision ? I see myself as a design thinker trying to hybridize different ways of   thinking and catalize the change . I believe that experience , adds an emotional asset to the   intelectual knowledge . The <NAME> approach is based on act , think and act again . Thus , the   experience applying this design thinking becomes an emotional asset for me and for my team .... 

 I imagine the design thinking as a continuous cross process where the rule is there are no strict rules . The   point is   which one is the most suitable place to access the system and which is the best way to do it so as   to "" catch the wave "" . I think the best way to take advantage of the stream , in this case , was finding the   way to align people around a common idea , and <NAME> was the best approach to do , as far as I   guessed then ... and I see now . To be honest , anyway , my way of access to the problem has elements of   visualizing and mind mapping as well . Thus I think that any alternative approach should lean always on   hybridizing . It 's a matter of how much of each tool I want to add to the recipe .

"Stakeholder management through interactive visualisation . 

 Challenge 

 I work in a creative solutions agency , managing a small portfolio of tech - based clients . We have   spent the past six months working on a full re - launch for one of those clients – a food ordering   and delivery service – with particular focus on their core product , a multi - platform app . While a   new brand positioning and launch campaign were important , we knew they would be futile   exercises if the app itself did n’t live up to consumers ’ expectations . It ’s very easy to tell someone   how good something is , but the moment of truth happens when a consumer interacts with your   product and experiences it for themselves .     There were a huge number of stakeholders involved in product development for this business ,   ranging from global C - suite executives accountable to shareholders , through to local coders   responsible for delivery and maintenance . Each stakeholder needed to be clear on what   improvements and changes were being made , why , and what the expected outcomes were . We   needed to find a way to communicate all of this , across varying levels of expertise , with a single   source of truth that was n’t open to misinterpretation .       Selection 

 While a variety of design thinking tools were applicable to the task , such as mind mapping and   learning launch ( using a ‘ release , test , improve , repeat ’ cycle ) , of particular value was the   visualisation tool .      Given the number and variety of stakeholders involved in the project , it was important that we   were clear on the changes we were proposing , how they would look and importantly , how they   would work . We used a specific type of visualisation tool , called wireframes , to ‘ mock up ’ how   screens would look and how they would function . ( Wireframes are a set of simple 2D images ,   showing the layout and expected functionality of a digital touch - point , such as an app or a   website . )       Application 

 We initially ran a number of mind mapping sessions with a variety of stakeholders – including   global CTOs , brand directors , app developers , user experience architects , product managers ,   salespeople and communications creatives – off the back of which we defined the critical design   criteria that would ensure success for this stream of work .      We then took the high priority improvements and started wireframing them . Our user experience   architect blended best practice user interface design with known customer insights from existing   research , and created visual representations of the new and improved app .      After gathering initial feedback from stakeholders on the wireframes , we could see that while the   they were helping people wrap their heads around the proposed improvements , they were a little   too simple of the complexity of this task and that when it came to understanding the functionality   underpinning the visuals , they were still very open to interpretation . So we decided to take our   wireframes one step further by a building a very basic prototype using the wireframes as the   skeleton – essentially a clickable set of interactive 2D drawings – enabling stakeholders to   actually ‘ use ’ the proposed improvements , as opposed to just ‘ looking ’ at them and trying to   visualise themselves how they might work . 

 Insight 

 The major insight we gained was that there are different levels of visualisation , and that for some   projects , simple visualisation is the ideal tool , while for others , you need to take it one step   further and actually bring that visualisation to life in a tangible , interactive way .     The introduction of interactive wireframes as a form of visualisation essentially created a single   source of truth for all stakeholders . Nothing was left to chance or assumption – all stakeholders   saw and interacted with the same prototype , and there was little room for misinterpretation .      Additionally , rather than reserving a prototype as a learning launch tool , we decided to use it as a   visualisation and demonstration tool , for the purpose of managing internal stakeholders , not   testing with external customers .       Approach 

 Visualisation is an incredibly helpful design thinking tool , particularly when it comes to describing   things that are open to interpretation , or come pre - loaded with individual assumptions . You can   flex and stretch the visualisation tool to suit the needs of individual briefs , and make it as simple   or detailed as you like .      We felt that visualisation , particularly interactive visualisation , was incredibly helpful for our   product and worked well with regards to managing the expectations of multiple stakeholders with   varying levels of product understanding . Visualisation brought to life insights from customer   research and priorities from mind mapping sessions , and contributed significantly to our   collective readiness for customer - facing learning launches . For this reason , we continue using   interactive visualisation for all app modifications as it ’s an excellent form of stakeholder   management .

"As a display artist , I certainly use visualization or visual thinking the   most . Visualization is very important as it allows us to think in a non- verbal , creative way . Since I am an artist , I express absolutely   everything through visualization .   Now , working with a client or those who evaluate my product , first of   all , I present to them a presentation in which everything is clearly   shown in diagrams and pictures . What inspired me , how I came to this   or that idea , what result I wanted to get – all of this is shown visually .      In my project , which is related to the creation of a font , for example , I   clearly showed where I took the elements to create a font , in what   order I connected them and what result I was striving for ( references ) .   Taken together , this formed a large , but understandable scheme . It   helped a lot to convey information to people . Made my thoughts   available to others . Visualization is especially helpful when I need to   quickly present a product ( in this case , a font ) , show the history of its   creation and how it can be used . In fact , it seems to me that   visualization is the only way to do it quickly and correctly . It is a   powerful tool for presenting complex information in an interesting and   easy to understand way . The human brain synthesizes and stores visual   information much faster and better than any other . However , if the   visualization is done incorrectly , the effect may be the opposite .   Incorrect presentation of information can not only partially distort the   message , but also lead to a completely misunderstanding . Data   visualization allows you to analyze large amounts of information and   see trends and relationships that were previously hidden .

"MAINTENANCE & REPAIR MOBILE APP 

 Learning Launch Tool 

 Challenge     One of the Stockholders of the company I work for , in which I develop the role of Head of   Operations , is determined to develop a New System based on <ADDRESS> and <NAME> <NAME> . This System   will allow users to access to different kind of services for home maintenance , such us plumbing ,   carpentry , electricity checking , etc . As in my country , currently , this kind of services are just   offered by recommendation , there are many issues to solve , but first it is important to determine   if this kind of service ( through Technology ) will effectively meet the offer and the demand   replacing the current way of doing it . My team has advised the Board to develop a MVP and   experiment before engaging in a bigger and more expensive project .     Selection     Our advice has been adopted by the Board of Directors , and therefore we have determined that   we will follow the Design Thinking Path and implement a Minimum Value Product based on the   main functionality the app should have , we expect to get the most important information from   the Learning Launch phase , this is a tool that will help the Directors to make a decision about a   larger investment .     Application     For the MVP we didn´t invest in building a hole product , we looked for similar Open Source   platforms , some of them had issues when many users where connected at the same time , but   that wasn´t a concern for the MVP . We integrated some Maps and Geolocation APIs in order to   be able to complete the main process of request , and we included some forms for Credit Card   Payment , but we did n’t integrate the whole Payment Ecosystem .   When we finished the App for the Learning Launch , we delivered it to the Business Development   Department . The distribution of this <NAME> was limited , and it was delivered through a mailing   campaign , we needed to measure : Number of Downloads , Number of Registrations , Time of   Navigation inside the app , Leads made .     Insight and Approach     The mailing campaign gave us some important feedback that we decided to include for a Version   2.0 of the MVP . Consumers preferred : 

 1 . The Service should be guaranteed by a formal company , the technology to just publish 

 services was not enough . 

 2 .   People were likely to pay higher prices if the services were provided by a Company and 

 not directly by workers . This was mainly related to security . 

 3 . People wanted to read reviews before hiring the service . 

 The learning launch gave the Company the most important lesson , that in order to reach the   market , the Company needed an Operations Partnership , because the technology was not all for   making this idea grow .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge and selection 

 I am an administrative member in the retail team of a consumer goods sales company . One of my   superior ’s and my own biggest and most constant challenge is to provide sales information and insights ,   both to my fellow staff members and field supervisors . 

 Putting up information for staff members is reasonably simple because we ‘ speak the same language ’ ;   we all have fairly similar academic background and share common knowledge through daily interaction   in the office . On the other hand , supervisors come from different backgrounds -most of them started as   store sellers , some were sales representatives from whole different industries , etc.- so their computer   skills vary from one another , and so does their understanding of words and KPIs that might seem very   common for the staff , such as ‘ growth ’ , ‘ variation ’ , ‘ profitability ’ , etc . 

 In this occasion , we had the challenge to provide daily sales information and insights to supervisors , in   order to help them focus on the stores and brands that had lower performance . This information had to   be useful , thus , it had to be understood by every supervisor regardless their skills . 

 We selected the Learning Launch tool to assess the understandability and usability of the information ,   by testing the solution with 2 supervisors : “ P ” a fast learner with the highest computer skills , and “ M ”   who has a much more traditional workstyle . 

 Application 

 The information was sent as a simple Excel file because it ’s the most common software used by the   company , and it could be browsed on the field with a cellphone . The file had 3 sheets : 

 - Daily sales by store , supervisor and brand , both from the current and past year   - Monthly sales target , current sales , and percentage of target fulfillment by store , supervisor and brand   - Sales year over year growth by store , supervisor and brand 

 We sent the initial file to both P and M , asked them to check the information and share their feedback .   The most important point was if they could easily spot the information that mattered most to them - their stores , their names , and the percentage of sales target fulfillment which would determine their   monthly bonuses . 

 After a few days , P and M sent their feedback . P reviewed the file and easily understood the   information . She concluded that the information she needed to plan her daily work schedule was part of   the first sheet , and the second one . However M , could n’t understand the first sheet and just focused on   the second one . 

 Insight and approach 

 Using the Learning Launch tool we confirmed that certainly , not every supervisor has the same skills to   read and understand information in a spreadsheet , and they face new tasks in different ways . 

 M could not understand the first sheet because of the amount of information it contained and the way   it was organized ( > 450 columns ; 2018 sales data on the top , 2019 in the middle and % growth at the   end ) . She became anxious and skipped to the sheet she could understand and was most relevant to her . 

 We thought that a way of reducing the confusion while browsing the file , was to simply hide the   columns and rows of the first sheet that were n’t useful to the supervisors . 

 On the second sheet , the most important to supervisors , thus the sheet they would always see ; we   added a column showing the overall sales status with signs and colors :  aligned with the objective ,    accelerate , and ! accelerate urgently . We thought this visualization would help giving emphasis to a   macro level , so they could drill down to the detail from there . 

 We understand that using Excel spreadsheets is quite basic . We would love to use more innovative ,   viewer - friendly visual tools , but unhopefully we do n’t have licenses yet . With the insights we gained   from this test , we found a new huge opportunity in training our supervisors regarding their computer   skills , and understanding their personal boundaries .

 The Story Telling Tool 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Storytelling is a powerful human - centered tool that helps users to understand their problems , thus   making products and services appear more user - friendly or even accessible to persons who are most in   need .   I volunteer with “ special needs <NAME> ” in schools which are catered to students who may be   differently abled i.e. autistic students , visually and auditory impaired students etc . In my country <ADDRESS>   there are very few programs catered to such students and these are the students who suffer the most in   the classroom as teachers may not understand how to cater to their specific needs especially when the   classroom is already overcrowded . Through my volunteer work I spend a lot of time with teachers trying   to find ways to inspire them to somehow improve the circumstances within the classroom for the sake   of their “ special learners ” . With the teachers I share stories where other teachers explored various   teaching methods and were successful in helping special students to grasp key learning concepts that   were once seemingly impossible with previous methods . The teachers ’ feedback was used alongside the   context of my story to determine their goals and interests . This information is then strategically used to   discover new techniques that helps teachers cater their lesson plans to include “ the special learners ” . 

 Application – A story about using story telling . 

 When I started university I noticed that there were quite a few “ special students ” that were determined   and passionate about learning but unfortunately , the university did not have the facilities to truly cater   to their needs . That ’s when I realize that something needed to be done . It ’s not fair for them to get this   far in their educational journey for them to be failed by an archaic educational system . I decided to meet   with the various heads of department to try to find a way to help these students . I started by telling   them successful stories about how I previously helped teachers to cater their curriculum to be inclusive   of special students . 

 Through the successful use of the storytelling tool it made them realize that learning difficulties are very   much present at the university level and that more needs to be done to assist these students . I told a   story about a visually impaired communications major student who needed assistance getting from   classroom to classroom . Due to his disability he often found it difficult to locate lecture halls and as a   result got to class late and was at a complete lost during the class session .   I soon realized that this was a   problem affecting all of the visually impaired student after speaking with them at the dining hall .   They   were so discouraged and demotivated because they were n’t getting the assistance they needed that   many of them were contemplating dropping out because it all seemed too impossible . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 Now it was time for me to open up about my personal experiences on the matter . One day at the dining   hall I meet with a few of these students and bought them coffee . I told them stories about family   members of mine that had similar disabilities . One such inspiring example is my mother . She has an   auditory impairment but is still a successful entrepreneur who is loved by everyone in her community .   She did n’t let an impairment stop her from achieving her dreams and being successful .   I told them how   opening a business seemed impossible to her due to her disability . My mother was able to work through   so much self - doubt and rejection and was able to prove herself in a competitive market . This story   inspired them and helped them to realize that there are many people just like them who have struggled   and were able to come out victorious . This inspiration gave them the motivation to continue attending   classes and last Fall one of them was able to graduate with their associates degree .

 The Story Telling Tool 

 I used this story to explain the problem to the University ’s Academic Board at a meeting and this made a   major impact on the faculty and the board members . New policies on disability services and support are   being implemented on campus and professors are being trained to deal with the “ special learners ” in   their classrooms . Making me realize that a relatable story was a good way to help others understand a   very common problem within our environment . 

 This course was very beneficial to me since it helped me to think outside the box by looking at creative   tools of problem - solving . One such tool being the story telling tool . This is a tool we use every day and   sometimes without even realizing it hence this course helped me to see this tool in a whole new way .   Now I can adequately prepare for presentations and think of stories that can help me to convey to my   audience the problem at hand and how we can begin to resolve them .

"Reflection - Visualization 

 Background & Challenge :    I was part of a team where we were asked to explore various ideas for   growing the existing business .   Also , we were asked to think in an unconstrained way in finding new   business models which could support our existing business and further fuel growth .   This was an   exciting challenge for me . For the background , I am part of the Corporate Strategy team of a large   Pharmaceutical Company . 

 I had been thinking of an idea , but was not able to give shape to the same .   I used this opportunity to   take my idea forward .   I had to discuss my idea with various team members and also members from   cross - functional groups to communicate my idea and also seek their inputs to build upon the idea .    The idea was to structure an innovative out - patient service experience for patients .   There did not   exist an out - patient structured program with any insurance companies and patients had various   problems while undergoing treatment on an out - patient basis . Patients , would need to decide which   doctor they would go to for a consult , which service provider they would go to for various diagnostic   services and which pharmacy they would need to go for their medical supplies .   As this problem was   human centered , I wanted to use the design thinking approach to attempt and put in place a   structured out - patient program . 

 Selection :   The first tool I used was the tool of Visualisation or Visual thinking .   This is about using   images . It is a way of visual thinking .   It is a way of unlocking a different part of our brains that allows   us to think nonverbally and that we might not normally use .   As I have learnt in the course video I ,   this tool is a very powerful tool and has a role to play in each of the steps of design process .    Visualization can be used for exploring ideas , pattern finding , ideation , prototyping and also during   the pilot & scale stage .   When we explain an idea using words , there is a possibility that the rest of us   will form our own mental pictures , usually driven by the respective backgrounds of different   individuals .   If instead we present our idea to all by drawing a picture of it , this reduces the   possibility of unmatched mental models and brings in greater alignment and sense of purpose . 

 I used this design thinking tool to achieve a shared understanding of the challenge at hand among   the group of various stakeholders from different backgrounds , before I attempted to define the   possible solutions to the problem . 

 Application : I started the process by creating a straw man picture of the challenge at hand along   with a set of questions and prompts for discussion to allow the diverse group of stakeholders to   learn from each other in the process of defining the possible solution , the key elements , and the   relationships between the elements to consider identifying the pain points and opportunities for   improvements or solutions . 

 For this activity I divided the group into two and gave them a copy of the straw man picture along   with a set of questions which the group had to discuss and answer , especially on identifying the pain   points of the patients and how in their view the pain points could be addressed .   I allowed 30   minutes to both the groups and then requested to exchange the understanding with the other group   before we assembled together . 

 Insight & Approach : What I have understood from this exercise is that the initial picture or the   graphic along with the comments and feedback is important to validate and reinforce the group ’s   understanding of the challenge they are working to solve .   Also , more importantly what we get from   this exercise is the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while the group is working to   define and understand their challenge .   The picture let the group focus for discussion on the root   cause of the challenge .   The group is able to establish relationships between key entities instead of   taking time to identify them . The group is also able to identify few areas on which they would need   more information or data . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I   would use the Visualization activity in various stages of the design process , viz . , while exploring   various ideas / solutions to a given problem .

"Example Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Nowadays we are living the next industrial and workplace revolution , called Digital   Transformation . In the company I work for , we need to develop new solutions for our clients ,   based on the new opportunities technology is providing us .     Once the solutions have been built , we need to bring them to our clients , providing them with   a commercial envelope that drag attention from our potential customers . The challenge here   is that we need to build a speech to reach our clients with two different approaches : 

 1 . We need to build something easy to understand and engaging , so that our possible   customers are interested in us in seconds 

 2 . We need to build something that let us have a full presentation to our interested   customers , showing the most important capabilities of the solutions and receiving the   request for a proposal 

 In the actual world we need to take into account that the face to face communication channel   is not the only one we can use to engage our clients . 

 Selection 

 We decided to use <NAME> as the way to develop our speech , because we found it to be   more engaging that other solutions we looked at . We also looked for a new concept ,   Storytelling transmedia , which allowed us to tell our story through different elements that we   could use in the channels available today . 

 Application 

 We created our main story based on the information gathered from our potential clients and   the market , to develop a script that shows the client ’s actual problems and how will their life   change once they applied our solutions to the places they fit .      Once we had the script written we decided how to split it into different parts that allows us to   tell the story using different media : Videos , interactive games , podcasts , written articles ,   infographics … and look for reutilization in different contexts and clients and identify which of   them needed to have different versions for our clients that range from great banks to small   government administrations .     We also decided to build an Elevator Pitch to engage customers at the different events we   are participating at , because in many of those events our commercials are able to handle   many short term conversations . We also used the Elevator Pitch to create short messages   for the channels best suited for this kind of promotion , like tweeter . Also , the feedback 

 received through those channels was used to improve the Elevator Pitch itself and to help us   create new messages associated to our story .     Once we had the script of our engagement story we built the Elevator Pitch , 5 tweeter   messages and a video demo , and sent them to the market , to see how well they perform and   learn about the experience before producing new content in different formats . 

 Insight 

 This story has a happy ending … partially . Our work done using storytelling provided us with   powerful selling tools , but we failed in one thing : In the development of our solutions we did   not a lot of observation on our customers … so the base of our solutions was not enough   focused on our possible customer needs , reason why we are not earning as expected . 

 Approach 

 The approach of using Storytelling Transmedia is correct and something we are using in   developing not only our commercial offers , but also to develop new products . The main   change we are doing whenever we use it , is to invest more time and effort in knowing what   the market is expecting and provide a good story to build it and sell it !

"Tool that applied : Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is a powerful tool that we use in different situations of our daily life and that I applied all the   times . 

 As a vice team leader of a club in my engineering school where I create my own brand , I always faced   the challenges of how to attract more students who are just comfortable with technical things to try and   fall in love with what we do in our club specially my brand . 

 I choose to apply storytelling as it is able to get insight into students , build empathy and reach them   emotionally . I often create personas to represent target users and add conflict to stories that reflect   their user journeys and problems . One of the reason is through crafting stories , we can better   understand what users want from a solution . Good stories always captivate audiences . 

 <NAME> makes it easy for everyone involved in the project to empathize with the users and ensure that   their work matches the story . Having a story throughout your project means marketing the design at   the end of the design process is also straightforward , as you already know exactly which story to tell to   show how your product provides value . 

 Application 

 Storytelling indirectly involves emotional branding . Emotional branding in fact is the practice of building   brands that directly appeal to consumers ’ self , emotional state , needs and aspirations . The purpose of   emotional branding is to establish a connection between consumers and products by stimulating   consumer emotions . Human needs such as love , power , emotional security , and self - satisfaction are   based on emotions in the subconscious , as the basis of emotional brands , and allow marketers to create   self - fulfilling prophecies in consumer demand . People want to meet demand , and advertisers need to   implement these needs in a permanent cycle . 

 Our project has launched a new natural shampoo product lines that allows real women to share their   product experiences in a facebook group of our project , through videos and blog where real women   share their hair transformation stories and how new natural products can save them . 

 This types of storytelling enables new customers more willingness to embark their journey on our   products as the review is real and high credibility . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning tool , we designed and tested our solutions . Through the learning process we   got to improve our product ’s function and design to meet user ’s expectation . It is through this process   we realized that the customers were more attract to the review from the Facebook as it is shared by   normal users but not celebrity or influencer . Our marketing department used the results of this process   to re - strategize our marketing campaign . Moving forward our business will focus on human centered   design to improve our product and services . 

 Approach 

 Through applying the storytelling tools , another tools like visualization and mind - mapping directly   applied . In order to perform a more perfect results , learning launch is another tool that I would be   considered in the next steps . One of the reason is learning launch is also an important tool for our   business . We need as a small team to review the insight gained from our first launch and incorporate   this insight into future launch designs as this is the most effective and ideal way of approaching and   implementing solutions . Future launch designs should reflect insight gained , progress made , and come   closer to a compelling solution ready for full roll out .

"REFLECTION - STORY TELLING 

 Challenge and Selection 

 As a   school manager I used storytelling in communicating my goals and plans . As I go in 

 the office I have so many clienteles in all walks of life . Parents of the pupils are my internal   stakeholders . They are my partners in managing the school in a road way to success . I m telling   them on how to participate and move forward in a projects . I need to say every thing to them ,   the plans , the procedures and the insights . So that it can be understood well and remembered .   These parents really loves to hear the academic standing of their child as it can boost their   egos . The sharing of stories reinforces their emotional reasons , that ’s why they remember it   and tell to the other people even outside the school . With this form of story telling ,   stakeholders share their donations to the school , giving a significant impact on resource   generation . 

 Application 

 In telling stories to the schools stakeholders , I utilized visual supports such as pictures 

 and story boards . This will make the story unique and easy to remembered . One example was   when I conducted General PTA Assembly . I used story telling to convey my plans and goals in   the School Improvement Plan . Story telling help me a lot in getting insight into stakeholders ,   build emphaty   and reach them emotionally . However , to become more effective . I make sure   that I have to define targets users or stakeholders . To envision experiences and gain emphatic   insights . Always put into considerartion the questions such as What , who and How . Hence , It   can arrive in a successful avenue for design thinking . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 For the insights and approach , implementation of design thinking in school managements gives   a productive outcome . Through this model , resource generation in the school increased . Its   because the stakeholders emphasized with the current situation of the   public school . It is the   best easiest tool to find solutions to complicated problems . Communication is the key in   adopting this tool in design thinking . In using it to the stakeholders it should be accompanied by   the real stories . Further , crafting of stories is very important so that it may appeal reliable and   valuable .

"REFLECTION – STORYTELLING 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 CHALLENGE     Today 's job market is highly competitive . The method of profiling is an age - old practice . But the prospects   of choosing the right candidate through this existing method is neither fool - proof nor authoritative . The   lacunae in today ’s profiling methodology includes issues like – lots to read ; dull self - descriptions ; no use of   infographics ; not real - time ; unverified data ; no universal rating system and not easily sharable . There are   plenty of aspects that are further required to evaluate a candidate better and therefore enable a prospective   employer to take a better - informed decision . 

 In such a scenario , creating the right collaterals to accompany one ’s traditional CV will make them stand   out from the multitude of profiles out there for a prospective employer to choose from . Video is a good   medium to communicate better . But just <NAME> <NAME> on its own will not give the prospective employer   enough information about an Individual to make a proper evaluation of their potential and skills .     So , the problem is universal and the current solution too is entrenched in current recruiting practices . To   bring in a paradigm shift in human behavior in profiling an individual , the best way to bring in decisive impact   is by using storytelling .     SELECTION     The challenge of effectively selecting a CANDIDATE could be better addressed by innovating VISUAL   PROFILING . And no better way than to tell the world personal real - life stories of multitude of individuals   through the use the digitally - driven creative technology solutioning approach . 

 APPLICATION     As technology advances , the chances of Individuals being noticed by an organization are very high . With   use of technology in the recruitment space , a lot of innovations are on the anvil and therefore ca n’t be   ignored . The first and foremost important advancement is the Video Résumé . With one ’s own Video   Profiling , one will get an authoritative head - start with their job search . This is the best way for job seekers   to showcase their abilities beyond the capabilities of a traditional paper resume . The Video Résumé allows   prospective employers to see and hear Candidates , apart from getting a feel for how one present   themselves . With modern capabilities of transmitting streaming video , <NAME> <NAME> is going to be the   best new advancement in the hiring space . 

 Enter VISUAL PROFILING .     Beyond video ’s , CV ’s are better presented through Visual Profiling . This enhancement will be highly   appreciated as it will profile the job - seeker as a complete personality . This approach can be seen as the   first part of an interview – which is to introduce oneself . Also , when a job - seeker has seen the company 's   videos and webpages and the recruiter has seen you on a video , both parties can arrive at a possible   decision during the first - face - to - face interview itself . Beyond all of this , there is a need for analysis and   possible decision - making parameters for a prospective recruiter . More so getting them self - generate their   profile – through stories from their own personal lives – brings in immense value in the corporate world .      INSIGHT     The whole idea of getting better insights into an Individual ’s life is so critical in recruiting that a disruptive   innovation is imminent in today ’s digitally connected world . Interestingly to address this fundamental issue ,   we need to understand human psychology in how one perceives one ’s own personality and his or her   perceived image in society . The rapid advent and penetration of various social media platforms like   Facebook , <NAME> , YouTube , <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> and TikTok clearly point to the direction of self- gratification from an individual ’s perspective . This explains the viral nature of such platforms getting users   generating content themselves as they see the immense potential of getting it noticed by family , friends and   strangers from around the world alike just by sharing online .     The same underlying principles applies to the effective profiling of individuals for a better evaluation of their   personalities from a single tool – even before they are contacted for a one - to - one interview session .     APPROACH     The first and more - most advantage is the idea of self - declaring facts of one ’s own life – and by getting   others testify about us on our behalf . The second most important aspect is when video is used as a   medium of communication . 

 The third most critical factor would be to achieve universality in an Individual ’s Profile Score across   certain standardized parameters . And the fourth important aspect being the importance of viewing each   and every Individual profile in a single view or SINGLE VIEW PROFILE ( SVP ) . 

 Also , use social media to present your stories to the world under a series called SHADES – therefore   getting noticed ! 

 Check out here – <URL>      ORGANIZATION     The storytelling approach drives compelling shift in perceiving how one ’s profile is presented to the world .   So , combining ( a ) storytelling with ( b ) social media self - creation for multi - platform shares ; ( c ) along with   one ’s wholesome personality description through a simple and single dashboard called SINGLE VIEW   PROFILE and creation of ( d ) universal Profile Scores will bring in much - needed creative approach and   credentials to the current boring MS Word or PDF document - based PROFILING ! 

 Interestingly , when multiple components converge and is narrated through the medium of   storytelling , our compelling objectives are bound to be achieved !

"Challenge 

 I work for a financial organization as a consultant / coach and currently support a team that deals   with helping clients finance commercial vehicles , in their business name / capacity . We have seen a   sharp decline in the sales numbers , specifically for entrepreneurial clients . Through research , these   clients have told us they do not have the time to call in at a branch and complete all the documents   to apply for the commercial vehicle asset finance and would like to apply for this when they have the   time , and on the channel or platform of their choice and would like a simpler user - friendly solution .   After all , they are already our clients and we have their information on hand . The project team are   full - time employed , so they are 100 % committed in terms of time allocation . They have been   allocated the support of a technical team that will assist with the development of the solution when   they are ready . The scope of the project is to look at creating a digital application platform and   redesigning the process flow of the back - end work . This also stresses commercial viability , with the   intent of creating a digital platform with a straight through process , speed of approval and deal   closure and more digital traffic and interest . The team needs to understand the client friction or pain   points so that whatever the solution they come up with , addresses these . 

 Selection 

 The team has already undertaken some design thinking exercises , using various tools , as well as   done some research with customers . They have also mapped out the process flows , from a customer   perspective to understood what some of the pain points are that clients are experiencing and being   frustrated by . The learning launch tool is the ideal next approach for the team as it will allow them to   run some quick tests , in the real world , on ideas or prototypes that they have in mind . Right now , it ’s   about learning fast and testing their ideas or hypotheses . In the Carsten Ho video , he clearly stated   that the “ purpose of a learning launch is to get to the truth , to either confirm or disconfirm your   assumptions ” . 

 Application 

 As the team kicked off their initial learning launch , they focused on testing with users a mock - up   design of an app , for a hand - held device , that allowed entrepreneurial clients the ability to apply for   their commercial finance . They were testing the assumption that this was how these clients wanted   to do this and also the process of doing the application . They thought they had a great solution and   were bullish about putting this in front of clients . As they engaged with clients ( still online via teams   because of covid ) , they were very taken aback as this assumption was challenged or disproved . Yes ,   clients wanted to apply for the finance themselves , but they did n’t want a separate app to do this ,   they wanted to see it integrated in their current banking app – so they use a single sign - on and they   have a finance application tile to take them to the process . Other clients wanted to be able do this   through their online banking and do this via their laptop / desktop and not on a handheld device . In   addition to this , the clients also gave them feedback around a few additional features that they   thought would be pertinent in this solution . An incredible lesson for the team was learn quick , fail   fast and cheap . 

 The team took the learnings away and incorporated these into another iteration of this reviewed   process . They also learnt not to take the feedback personally but rather consider it a valuable review   to allow them to refine their work . For their next learning launch , they used a refined mock - up of 

 their solution and had created both an app option and an online banking option so they could test   the client ’s choice of platform as well . They incorporated herein some of the additional features and   refined flows , that the clients had recommended . Having these two options available allowed them   to validate their refined assumption of where clients wanted to apply for their finance . This also   validated that clients wanted to do it themselves . This really identified that the clients had a burning   need and that they would be willing to use their solution – asking when it would go live . This   validated for the team that this solution was much better than the current in - branch application   process . 

 This process of learning for the team is still ongoing and there are more learning launches planned .   This component of rapid learning and testing has been welcomed by the team and they are currently   iterating on their solution again so they can test with clients . 

 Insight 

 We perceive ourselves to be client centric , but unless we are challenged and go through learning   interventions like the learning launch , we do not see the world clearly or through the eyes of our   clients / users . The learning launch tool allowed us as a team to really connect deeper with our   clients / users by testing our assumptions with them . It may be uncomfortable to have assumptions   “ disproven ” in the beginning , but as we go away and analyse the output , we see and gain the true   value . This also allows us to see that we are not designing for ourselves , but rather for those that we   really want to use our solution to solve for a real problem or pain point . We should also not take   anything personally but rather see the true value in the feedback . The learning launch tool has   brought that value to me / us and also shown that its better to fail fast and learn quickly . The failure   component is where the magic of the learning happens . I addition to this we received feedback from   clients as to what they really wanted to see in the solution . This in itself is priceless and has   contributed to additional learning launches the team will commit to and will ensure that we embed   this approach in future projects . These insights allow us to me more effective . Design thinking opens   up a world of allowing us to think differently , offers us a vast array of tools to support and challenge   ow we do things , and let ’s us see that people are open to us testing concepts or ideas that are   roughly put together – we do not need to spend the money first – its about testing and learning and   refining . We will only do product design when we have done the learning and the testing . , 

 Approach 

 One of the things that I might consider in the approach before we do anything else is applying the   mind mapping tool / approach to us as the team , to help us work through the great amount of   systemic data collected by the team . This would need to be right at the beginning of a project   though as it really just helps us organise the data and see patterns and insights . Because of the   nature of what we are solving for though , I believe that the learning launch tool really was / is the   best for us to apply . Everything learned from the initial learning launches have realised some great   insights and we will continue to refine , with these learnings , what assumptions , or truths we want to   validate or disprove . After all , we want our client to use our solution because it meets their need to   solve their specific problem . If there is any else I may do , it may be working on ensuring we prepare   good open ended questions to ask during our learning launch , to get those deep insights from our   valuable clients .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge:​ As a child I have been fascinated with ‘ Chikki ’ . ‘ Chikki ’ is a traditional indian   sweet / snack . Chikki is also known as groundnut brittle , ​gud , <ADDRESS> , kadle <NAME> ​ among some   other local names . While there are over 11 brands in <ADDRESS> city alone , all of these   brands mix sugar and glucose into their product which is unhealthy . Traditional chikki only   uses groundnuts and jaggery . Now - a - days in the competition driven environment , to make   larger profits , all brands have diluted the traditional sweet to just <ADDRESS> ‘ <ADDRESS> ’ product . I   wish to launch a healthier alternative , the traditional chikki back to the market .     Selection : ​I have chosen the Mind Mapping tool from design thinking to solve for this   challenge . <NAME> <NAME> as a tool is used for looking into patterns , gaining insights and   coming up with creative strategies to solve for a design challenge . ( Video lecture reference :    Week 3 , Video 4 )      Application : ​I have currently started on this entrepreneurial step , so I do have some ground   data to filter . Hence , I see a lot of potential with the mind mapping technique . With the vast   amount of data like what does the customer want in a chikki , to data which shows what   retailers want in a brand to what challenges exist in running a manufacturing outfit , and what   is sales looking like for existing brands , the data is immense . The best possible method to   tackle this is using the mind mapping tool as it allows for the data to be segmented and   bracketed which allows for better pattern recognition and insight .      Insight : ​One real example is that from the current market sales , it was observed that sales   of chikki products which were visible in the packing ( transparent ) packing sold more than the   ones which had opaque packing . While it could be estimated that this could be due to   several reasons like brand loyalty and others . When this data was correlated to customer   feedback , they have expressed that they prefer packings where they can see what they are   buying . This allows me to infer that transparent packing is a superior method .      Alternate Approach:​ I would use the Visualization tool as this too helps to understand   shared challenges and insights among diverse stakeholders .

"Learning Launch Tool 

 Challenge 

 I work for a consultancy firm and my challenge is to create a dashboard that provides a clean ,   visual and objective look of the company results . The dashboard must have some KPIs and I can   use 2 trainees to build it . The creation is limited to internal resources ( employee time ) . The   biggest challenge is to deliver with minimum corrections in just 3 work days . Me and my team   will focus on talking to the key stakeholders to understand what they consider critical   information for the dashboard and the way they prefer to visualize it . 

 Selection 

 Our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools , so we are ready to   try the learning launch tool . Broadly speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to   quickly test an idea ( product or service ) and prototype . The base of the Learning Lunch Tool is   to test the initial assumptions with the key customers / stakeholders and learn from them ,   building your product or service with more accuracy than if you just do it by yourself . 

 Application 

 For our first learning launch , we focused on the structure / execution of our dashboard . In   particular , we wanted to see if we could structure our KPIs and key information in an agile way   by interviewing the dashboard stakeholders . Our team went through a 12 hours interview with   10 partners and senior managers to understand the way they think . Next , we went through   another 12 hours day to build the best dashboard as we can . Than we half the last day presenting   to the CEO and hearing his points of correction , and the other half day we use to finish the   dashboard and deliver then to the other stakeholders through a meeting that all of then were   invited . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning launch tool , our team identified our assumptions and designed launches   to test these assumptions . Additionally , we thought through anticipated results , expecting to   find that a more agile approach would improve our dashboard . Our actual results were slightly   different from what we anticipated : the way the stakeholders need the information was more   graphically than what we expected and the team needed to do adjustments because of this .   Moving forward , our team will review this insight and incorporate it into future launch designs . 

 <NAME> 

 Given that our team has never gone through design thinking activities / tools , but study the   concept of agile methodologies , the learning launch was the appropriate tool for us to use in   this case . As previously mentioned , our team needs to create a dashboard that show the results   of the company in a clean , easy and objective way .

"Reflection - Visualization 

 Challenge . 

 I am an entrepreneur , and I am starting a project to sell sportswear online together 

 with my brother , our challenge is to make our business grow and be well known , but 

 to be known for having a page that attracts a lot of attention . only for the quality of 

 our clothes that if we evaluate and we already have , we want our clients to be 

 attracted to our page and when they open it they realize that they are going to find 

 what they are looking for and need . A page that stands out and is not so common 

 and basic . 

 Selection 

 We opted for a very important and necessary design tool for our challenge which is 

 the visualization tool , because with this important tool we can reinvent our page , 

 looking for an innovative idea to do something new . 

 Application 

 We started by analyzing and asking our clients what they liked the most and what 

 attracted them the least about our page ? After 2 days of questions we realized that 

 what matched the most was that the photos were striking , but would you like to see 

 them in someone to know how the clothes fit on a body , we thought of solutions and 

 one of these is the most common on the pages which were photos of the model 

 wearing our clothes , but thanks to the design thinking we wanted to delve into the 

 solution because that was very basic , so we decided to take the photos but with 

 more common people with whom it is easier to identify ourselves than with a model , 

 so when customers saw how they fit they really knew how clothes looked on people . 

 Insight 

 At the beginning I thought that people were going to reject the idea , because it was 

 not something that customers are used to , but thanks to design thinking we took a 

 risk and started executing the idea , when we published the new photographs people 

 started asking more questions and we got many more followers , customers noticed 

 the great change because now they clearly saw the way in which the clothes were 

 seen in people like them , in addition to the comfort that characterizes sportswear and 

 beauty when wearing them , then they began to send their own photos of how they 

 were saving us time and money because they authorized us to upload them to our 

 page . 

 Approach 

 This project had no time limit , we are still working on it , we do not want to speed 

 things up but we already know that to achieve a great achievement in the growth of a 

 company it is necessary to take risks and know the customer 's point of view and that 

 it is very important . Thanks to design thinking we have a great connection with our 

 clients .

"Improving distribution penetration and awareness of branded medicines in rural <ADDRESS> 

 Learning Launch : 

 Challenge : I work in a pharmaceutical company which sells branded medicines across different   therapeutic areas cross <ADDRESS> and many more countries . Healthcare facilities in most countries ,   including <ADDRESS> , are better in cities and Tier I towns compared to smaller towns and villages . This is   applicable right from infrastructure of hospitals , diagnostics centres , and availability of branded   medicines at pharmacies . The intent was to provide access to good quality medicines to the patients   in smaller towns and thereby increasing sale of our branded medicines . However , it was believed that   patients in smaller towns prefer to use generic unbranded medicines which are cheaper than branded   medicines . Hence , most of the distribution points and sales force of pharmaceutical companies are   based in cities and tier I towns . 

 Selection : I had some data and a hypothesis which said that people in Tier II and below towns want   good quality medicines for their near and dear ones but branded medicines are not available easily in   these towns . I visited smaller towns in different states and interviewed patients , pharmacists , doctors   in these towns . Since I only had a hypothesis , a plan and an intent , I was not sure about the success of   the plan . The project will require a large field force when operations will be in full scale . That ’s when   I selected learning launch tool to quickly experiment in the market place . 

 Application : I deployed a team of 9 members to start a pilot project in one of the states in <ADDRESS> . Each   member had to visit doctors and pharmacists in 24 smaller towns , twice a month . The purpose was to   increase awareness and educate doctors about well - known branded medicines and to make our   branded medicines available at 3 to 4 pharmacies in these towns . The team had to also connect these   pharmacies to large distributors in the tier I towns who would supply medicines to these pharmacies .   Members from various functions like finance , distribution , strategy , human resources also visited   these towns along with the 9 members for insights . Data during the pilot was captured by the 9   member team in specific formats through a mobile application . 

 Insight :   Insights from the data captured in the mobile application and from the conversations with   doctors , patients and pharmacies were very encouraging . I found that there were a set of patients   that had prescription of a doctor that he / she visited in a city and purchased branded medicines which   were available in a pharmacy in the small town . There were also a few doctors in these towns who   prescribed branded medicines to a few patients when they wanted a quick recovery . These doctors   also preferred branded medicines in certain therapies . Such insights helped in selecting well - known   brands in specific therapeutic areas to be promoted in these markets . 

 Approach : The tool that I selected , “ Learning Launch ” , helped me in proving my hypothesis and   making necessary changes in the go to market strategy . In this case , selection of brands in specific   therapeutic areas was very important and selecting specific states , where health care was not well   penetrated in Tier II and below towns , was important . The insights from the pilot also helped in   creating mechanism to connect the pharmacies in these towns to distributors in the larger towns .   There were also changes done in the mobile application to capture sale and process metrics data and   in designing dashboards . The approach helped in scaling up the project to 8 different states within 6   months which helped in additional growth of 5 % in sale for these branded medicines . There was a   greater satisfaction that good quality and affordable medicines were made available to patients across   the length and breadth of these states .

"Designing Thinking for Innovation – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 As the marketing lead for my organization , I led the challenge to evolve our live event for an industry   faced with monumental changes as a result of COVID-19 in order to ensure attendance while delivering   ROI for our exhibiting customers .   The project scope included the marketing team comprised of 8   employees , as well as the entire event team across all functions – all who have significant customer   interaction .   The project is limited to internal resources , in small group settings with a marketing team   member on each , with initial evolution ideas presented to the broader group within 15 days .   Each   teams ’ focus included the impact of the Corona Virus on the industry we serve , the immediate and   short - term needs in the business owners in this sector , and the need and expectation of the exhibitors   at these live events . 

 Selection 

 Our teams have completed the presentation portion of the thinking for innovation and implemented the   attendee research , and the most compelling idea is to broaden the scope of our attendee segments   beyond our traditional core ; and the next step to test our learning is the learning launch tool .   ( Broadly   speaking , the learning launch is an experiment meant to quickly test an idea and prototype ) . 

 Application 

 For our first learning launch , we focused on the data to extrapolate the educational needs of our   potential attendees across all segments .   In particular , we wanted to see if we could create unique ,   meaningful content that appealed across all segments to begin to build a learning library that would   deliver across all needs .   This tested our assumption that education would be a driver for event   attendance , and that all needs were the same .   Our team then conducted research to gauge interest   level by group .   This step was completed in the short time frame of one week - and identified that while   there were common needs across all business types – each had unique challenges that they needed help   addressing . 

 For our second learning launch , we focused on gaining clarity of needs and priorities of each specific   group to determine commonalities and differences .   Our team then completed quick phone interviews   across all sections , with questions focused on identifying immediate business challenges , business   evolutions taking place currently , expected business evolutions within the next 3 - 6 months , and   opportunities realized as a result of COVID-19 .   Both this survey and the interviews were conducted over   a one week time period . 

 Finally , we developed and rolled out an interactive learning platform with four pillars of focus , one each   for our core audience and three new prospective attendee groups as a final test of proof of concept . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning launch tool , our team was able to narrow the educational offerings to meet   specific needs – including identifying several common needs , as well as several business - type specific   needs – across the short time frame of less than one month .   We uncovered several unknown   challenges , specific to employee recruitment and retention , that we were unaware of .   Moving forward ,   our team will continue both online surveys and attendee interviews to be sure we are delivering the   most relevant educational content for our customers . 

 Approach 

 We have uncovered that continual customer research and interviews will help us to deliver the most   relevant educational content for our customers and cement the value of attendance for both our core   and new attendee segments .   Moving forward , keeping a pulse on the needs of the industry will ensure   we are rolling out a program that meets the needs of all of our customers . 

"
"Challenge & Selection 

 The ﬁrst tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared   understanding of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to   identify and deﬁne possible solutions to the problem . I use this approach often with our   customers , who are private agencies working to improve their proﬁtability    through innovations in   technology or management insights to modernize their mission or the delivery of their services to   their customer , which may be Indian citizens , businesses , and non - citizens . I have used the   technique of using a    “ Proﬁts = Revenue- Cost ” visualization model of a problem domain with a   set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from   each other in the process of deﬁning the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships   between elements to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or   solutions . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating an issue tree of Proﬁts written at the top and two branches coming   out it - 1 . Revenue & 2 . Cost . This is graphic of the problem domain . To develop the issue tree graphic , I will draw from many existing material available to understand the environment . The   existing material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing   materials , GAO or other auditing reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal   interviews with one - three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the   initiative . Then I will typically ask about the background information in the C - C - P - C framework   that is Questions about 1 . Company 2 . Competition 3 . Product & 4 . Customer . This will help me   gain a holistic understanding of the case and also give me some starting points to investigate the   root cause of decline in proﬁtability for the client . 

 If appropriate to the situation , I will borrow the concept to market entry framework/ Cost reduction   or Revenue maximising framework   from previous research , and discussed in <NAME> M. <NAME> ’s   book , “ The McKinsey way ” . The proﬁtability   approach helps to reinforce the notion that every   proﬁtability problem no matter which industry the client operates in , can be solved and its root   cause analysed by using the aforementioned method . 

 For the activity , I will divide the revenues into number of units sold & price per unit . I will also   divide the costs into number of units sold & cost per unit . Then I ask the past trends of each of   these heads to understand which one is causing a decline in proﬁts and then ask why ? On that   head to further dig deeper into the problem head to ﬁnd the root cause . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the framework    – especially the worked out framework with problem heads that incorporates the root cause   analysis – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity   is the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to deﬁne their   problem   space . The framework gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that   allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their   problems . 

 Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I   would use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities .   Then the analysed framework   that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a   reference tool throughout the remainder of their work .

"Reflection- <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge and selection 

 I live and work in a remote and under develop country called <ADDRESS> in west <ADDRESS> , my work has to do the with wholesale purchase of cooking gas from companies and reselling to diverse homes in retail quantity for cooking . The demand for cooking gas in <ADDRESS> is high due to lack of constant electricity . But recently I realise our revenue and customer patronage was dropping and that was when I engage in the mind mapping tool for an innovative solution 

 Application . 

 I humbly invited our top customers and distributed some questionnaire which entails on how well we can serve them , any deficiency noticed ? Any difficulties whatsoever in coming to the station to get their gas cylinder refilled ? 

 after gathering the numerous data ’s , I realise 90 % of our top customers marked and said the same thing which is the stress of coming to the station due to the bad roads and the havoc it does to their cars . 

 Insight and approach 

 I realise Mind mapping gave me confidence and ability to engage my customers in the best possible way to serve them better and I was able to think of home delivery . 

 So rather than our customers coming to us to refill their gas cylinder , we decided to ease their burden by coming to them to pick it up , refill it and bring it back to them .   This innovation gave us an edge in our community and things began to fall in line with increase in patronage .

"Week 5 Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 While doing this course of “ Designing Thinking for Innovation ” the topic that stood 

 out to me was <NAME> <NAME> .   <NAME> <NAME> is a new concept for me . I think 

 that ’s one of the reasons that it stood out to me . I currently work for dialysis clinic 

 as a social worker . I ’ve have been doing dialysis social worker for about 3 years 

 now . I ’ve worked for two different companies during that period . In dialysis the 

 business I ’ve noticed that it is hard to get people to think outside of the box . And 

 things tend not to be very efficient when it comes to completing task .   Concepts 

 such as <NAME> <NAME> are the type of ideas concepts that my work needs in 

 place to help grow to its full potential . We talk about growth all the time but 

 there ’s no real innovation to achieve any of our goals . 

 Selections 

 As stated before I do n’t think my company thinks too much outside of box . I think 

 is safe to say that have no vision . I believe that mind mapping will help develop 

 some type of vision for us . <NAME> <NAME> will us a clear visual of what our plan is 

 to help grow and best possible company . Showing the team a clear visual of the 

 hierarchical and relationships among pieces of the whole should only benefit the 

 team . Hopefully this can get individuals out their “ that ’s not my job ” type of 

 mindset . My main goal is to help other ’s see the bigger picture . 

 Application 

 Research states that   using mind mapping increased their productivity by 25 % . If 

 that ’s not convincing enough , a different study showed that it also increases the 

 pace of work to 44 % . Known for improving collaboration among professionals , 

 mind mapping platforms can be used as an alternative to traditional presentation 

 building tools such as PowerPoint .   Which is something that we use often within 

 my company .   PowerPoint to me is such uninspiring thing to me . So wanted to 

 get my company to start using different mind mapping apps and soft where . 

 These tools can help us create engaging and informative mind maps that you 

 can easily share with employees and colleagues alike . 

 In practice I wanted to improve our intake and enrollment process . This one of 

 the biggest issues we have . There have many breakdowns in this process past . It 

 definitely something I want to correct because correcting this now will make our 

 lives easier moving forward . So I basically took things into my own hands and 

 created <NAME> <NAME> for the intake process .   I spent about 3 days looking at the 

 currently process and analyzing the flaws .   I then download a mind map program 

 and outlined the old and new process . I used both processes to compare and 

 contrast the old breakdowns and new improvements . 

 Insight / Approach 

 I was quit surprised of the how the team reposed to the suggestion that pitched . I 

 think what help the process is having that visual to where they could see 

 everything I was talking about . I wonder if I different approach how would have 

 things been . Because I ’ve seen thing first hand that most people do like change . I 

 think having people see that process step by step was major factor has to why it 

 worked so well . I think the intonation that was used was the key .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge and Selection     I am responsible for the marketing of a startup that works with the development   of solutions for agricultural management . The startup is small , has 15 members   and today , our biggest challenge is to talk to the agro market , which is very closed   and resistant technologies in the field .   As we work at home office , it is very difficult to establish communication between   the team , there are always noises in the information , which ends up slowing down   the processes , because we often need to redo something that was not very well   understood and executed the first time .       Application     It will be very important to apply Design Thinking to startup because the   innovation industry changes very fast and aligned with the thoughts of the team ,   the market and the customers is a great opportunity to leverage our tools ,   accelerate processes , co - create , and think in groups .       Vision and approach     Our team is small but very diverse , we have different profiles , which I believe   design thinking will greatly contribute , since we will have to observe the whole   process with different looks . Many times we think that something would work well   in a way , but when we put in the group , we see that not always what is valid for   me , is what the other seeks . The world is very diverse , understanding the stages   of the process , understanding the customer and being assertive , really is   something complex , but I believe very strongly in the strength of this approach ,   which is Design Thinking , and I want to transport your tools to the startup routines ,   and so you have more security to drive people and processes .

"Reflection – Complaint handling enhancement by using the 

 visualization tool 

 Challenge & Selection   I am working in a retail company and responsible for the service   improvement project management . Recently , I have received many   feedbacks from the front - line Customer Service , Shop Sales and   management staffs that they are facing difficulty on Complaint handling   process especially when the complaint has to escalate to another party ,   seeking for the management advice or submit waive approval request for   the management approval . The poor internal communication process   usually causes service delay which has impact on the end - customer   complaint handling experience . Besides , the disordered communication   makes management staffs not able to understand the full picture of the   complaints and to make a right decision because email is a unique   communication channel and there is no systematic way to save and   review all of the complaints data . The management also have no way to   analyze the data then to identify improvement area for service   improvement .   After quickly understanding of their problem background , I decided to   use Visualization tool to deeply understand the problem among different   stakeholder groups . I have invited different stakeholders and used the   straw man visualization with setting few questions for group discussion .   Through - out defining the scope , key elements and relationship , the   stakeholders are able to put into other ’s shoes so that they are able to   learn and understand each other ’s pain points and identify the solutions   from another point of view .       Application   I draw few straw man graphics basing on the stakeholder categories   ( front - line Customer Service , Shop Sales and management ) on a poster   size papers and stated few questions near the straw man : 

 l Activities – What happen ? What are he / she doing ? What is 

 his / her task ? What are his activities ? How ’s the status before   and after the activities ? 

 l Interaction – What is the interaction channel ? Is he / she using 

 any system / interface ? How ’s he / she interact with other parties ?   What is the interaction flow ? 

 l Objects – Is he / she using any device ? What is the user 

 environment / location ? 

 l User – What is his / her role ? Who will react on his / her action ?   l <ADDRESS> point – Why he / she is not feeling good on the existing 

 handling method and workflow ? What is his / her concern ? 

 l Want – What he / she wants ? What is his / her target ? 

 I divided the stakeholders into 3 groups and each group representing one   stakeholder group . I distribute the straw man poster to each group , and   they have 60 min to write their answers on the poster directly . Once the   exercise has been completed , those 3 straw man posters will be posting   on the wall together . Each team representative present their answers   and other teams provide an insight and additional information to make   the information on each poster completely . During the session , I am   consolidating their insight , commonalities and feedback then revised the   posters and seek for their agreement of the changes .      Insight and Approach     What I learned is that from using this visualization tool , it can easily lead   the discussion and thinking direction of the group members , especially   when they have no clue , this diagram and the set questions can help and   inspire them . In addition , through group discussions , they can increase   interaction and learn about everyone ’s different ideas , thereby   increasing empathy and becoming pertinent to the problem ’s point of   view . This mode of thinking can also improve the working culture in the   long run . And through using this visualization tool , we can also quickly   find out the problems and pain points faced by the customers , which can   help us create more accurate follow - up solutions .   I will use this valuable graphic in different customer experience   enhancement projects in the future as this tool could help different   internal parties 360 degree review customers situation especially identify   the customer ’s pain point effectively .

"Visualization 

 What is a Visualization ? 

 One of the most required and important thing for design thinking . It helps us to   think in a different and a better way . It helps us to visualise in a non - verbal way   and helps us to improve our creative skills . 

 What is done in Visualization ? 

 In visualization we have equal importance for listening , thinking and even   drawing . 

 Steps of Visualization : 

 a ) Input :   Here listening is input    b ) Processing : Here thinking is the process   c ) Output : Here drawing is the output . 

 All these steps together helps us to get new possibilities to solutions . 

 The main part is that you must be able to communicate with people . The   requirements for mastering it are imagining people , spaces , situations and   actions or movements . 

 The more you start drawing pictures , the more people understand of how   and what you are talking in visual image form .   It 's anything but difficult to   make a basic outline – and most anybody can draw a stick figure , a circle , a   square , or a bolt . Those are the essential structure squares of making a   Visualization . We can open the ability to think contrastingly by doodling .   Representation has a task to carry out all through the Design Thinking . It 's a   fantastic device , in that sense , in that we 're utilizing those instruments and   that piece of our cerebrum at each stage in the plan cycle . It 's not simply   something that has an application in one piece of the Design Thinking . It   has numerous methods of being helpful at various pieces of the Design   Thinking measure .

"Example Reflection- Learning Launch 

 Challenge : The challenge I faced was that I worked in the startup to create a new food related   innovation in order to better the eating habit of low income customers . We had already completed the   initial phase of the design thinking processes of the asking the customers about their needs and   observing their unspoken needs . So now we need to test the assumptions about our product 

 Selection : We selected the Learning Launch design tool in order to test our assumptions about our   product . <NAME> <NAME> is a design thinking tool where we make cheap , fast prototype to test our   hypothesis about the product to see if it will work in the market or not . We had decided to create a type   of charity kitchen where we would collect the unserved that did n’t get served to customers in   restaurants and we would collect , repack and sell it at a low price for the financially challenged . 

 Application : We decided to rent a small shop in our area and collaborated with a few small restaurants   who were willing to let us take their unused ingredients and meal . For the raw ingredients we cooked   them in dished and packed them while the unserved meals were also up for sale . The first few days   where slow in customer response but by the end of the week we had a enough of a customer base to   test our product . The response of the customers was good they were grateful that they could eat meals   made by high end restaurants at low prices since they before they could n’t afford to eat there . We also   realized certain concerns of our customers in regards to our meals . 

 Insights : Some of the customers wanted a better and greener meal , as they were health conscious about   their meals , others had concerns regarding quality of meals we provided them while some wanted the   options to have drinks with their meals . Realizing these concerns , we decided to change some things . 

 Approach : So in order to effectively utilize the insights we had gained from our Learning Launch we   started adding more salads and fruits as side dishes in our meals . We also provided fruit based drinks for   customers that wanted something to drink . As for the insuring the quality of the food we provided we   started a certification program where we only took meals and ingredients from retreatants that passed   a certain hygiene threshold . After that we took these lesson to heart and remembered to use them in   any upcoming project

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I work at a company with regional offices , and I have to organize orientation programs for 

 new employees . It has been difficult to organize this program in person with all these travel 

 restrictions . So I have to find a way to do this online and allow the new employees to 

 understand the work environment and our company culture . The new employees come from 

 different countries and they are now working from home . It is not easy to effectively get our 

 messages across and get them engaged in an orientation program . 

 Then I discovered the design thinking tool , Visualization , to help me conduct the orientation 

 program . For an in - person orientation program , we already have powerpoint slides and 

 materials ready , but we have to make the activities available through online meetings , and 

 more visualized for the online program . 

 Application 

 Originally for in - person program , there was an activity about their preferences of work culture 

 and practices . On the floor , we would mark a line with a scale from 0 to 10 , we would ask 

 them to come up from their seats , and stand next to the line that fits their preference . 

 So for online program , we would ask these employees to all come to a Google spreadsheet , 

 so that we could collaborate together online . We use cells in the spreadsheet to represent 

 the scale , and ask the employees to fill in their colors to indicate their preferences . This 

 allows us to bring the activities online and let the employees participate actively during the 

 online orientation program . And these activities provide them opportunities to discuss with 

 each other more visually in the online meeting . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 In the after - program survey , the employees would have to provide feedback on what they 

 find useful in the online orientation program . Visualization is really effective in delivering 

 messages when people are likely to be distracted . <NAME> of them would find the orientation 

 program helpful in understanding the company . The program is not a one - way 

 communication in which we talk about the powerpoint slides . It allows the employees to 

 participate actively through the activities visualized with online tools . The satisfaction rate of 

 the participants could maintain as high as an in - person orientation program . 

 We will continue to improve our online program . When we are able to organize an in - person 

 program again , I will plan more visualization tools in the program . I believe using a design 

 thinking approach could help us achieve much more .

"REFLECTION - Visualization 

 <NAME> <NAME>   1 

 Challenge 

 A few weeks ago , my team was asked to hold a workshop to develop a roadmap to demonstrate the   plan for reforming IT procurement and usage throughout the MTN ( ISET Charguia ) .   This   roadmap had to be simple enough to provide a “ cheat sheet ” for incoming cabinet members to rapidly   consume and understand the path forward to reforming IT across the ISET Charguia .   We collected stakeholders   and set the date to hold the workshop . 

 Due to the diversity of the stakeholders ( From multiple departments and organizations within the ISET Charguia ) ,   we knew that we would have to rapidly work towards building consensus within the group to keep them   focused towards the end goal .   The Workshop began with a round table to discuss existing processes ,   procedures , and issues that the various stakeholders were having relative to their departments .   This   approach could have rapidly developed into a heated discussion about the various problems ,   roadblocks , etc . concerning IT processes within the ISET Charguia . 

 Selection 

 Due to the desired outcome of an overall roadmap for reforming IT across the ISET Charguia , and already   possessing a strong understanding of the stakeholders , the visualization tool was selected as the best   tool to use for guiding our stakeholders to a solution .   Our team thought that using visualization   techniques would yield additional graphics to support developing an overarching strategy for the reform   plan .   Additionally , we felt that getting the stakeholders to visualize the various processes would ease   understanding and ease the path to consensus . 

 Application 

 As expected the meeting began with a heated discussion of various processes and procedures and   rapidly took on the air of complaint about problems within stakeholder ’s mission areas .   Our team   decided to start the visualization process to help the involved parties see the overall problem in its   current state .   We started with having stakeholders develop a timeline incorporating a swim lane , similar   to those used with process flowcharts , and followed with markers to show major process points and   times .   We stood at a whiteboard and assisted the stakeholders to develop their own areas of the   roadmap .   After the individual stakeholder “ Maps ” were created , we combined the individual roadmaps   into a single roadmap that visualized the current state of IT within the ISET Charguia .   After the “ Current state ”   map was created , we then focused the stakeholders to optimize the current state and determine a clear   path forward for reforming the processes and procedures involved with IT procurement .   This combined   and optimized roadmap , through a series of revisions , will serve as the business plan going forward to   reform IT across the ISET Charguia . 

 Insight 

 Complex problems are sometimes easier to understand when shown visually .   Our workshop could have   rapidly developed into an unproductive morass of blame and temper sharing , however visualization   tools helped us to focus the group to the development of “ As is ” states for their processes and to focus   the group writ large to develop solutions vice debate the problems in an existing framework .   Using the 

 REFLECTION - Visualization 

 <NAME> <NAME>   2 

 visualization tools , we were ultimately able to focus the stakeholders present to work towards a   common goal , vice debating problems areas . 

 Approach 

 Overall , I think we will use the visualization tool again to gain insight into complex problems and   processes .   Our methodology was effective at framing the problem and obtaining a solution .   Things I   would do differently would be “ Pre - visualize ” to ensure that all the right stakeholders were brought into   the discussion .   During our workshop , it was illuminated that a few of the key members of the   stakeholder group were missing , predominantly from outside organizations that have a significant   influence on Information technologies within the ISET Charguia .   Additionally , I think having a bank of concepts or   supporting iconography would assist with the development of an end - product as this accounted for a   significant amount of discussion and debate .

"Virtual Classes - Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 In <ADDRESS> , as in many other countries , there are both private and state education . Due to the   appearance of the COVID-19 , the government adopted as a preventive measure , to   suspend all the face - to - face classes . They announced that state schools ’ classes would be   transmitted through national channels , leaving the modality through which the virtual   classes of private institutions would be transmitted , free to choose . As a measure to be   applied as soon as possible , one of the first challenges appear for these institutions . 

 Currently , I ’m working in a private school , in which our first challenge was to continue   classes . As there was no exact date for the return to the face - to - face activities and with   hope that <NAME> positive cases would decrease and the disease would be controlled ,   the directors decided that the suitable teachers , in other words , those who had a computer   or laptop and access to the Internet , should upload their classes on <NAME> ( videos ) or   Power Point with audios . After a few weeks of mandatory social isolation and observing   the fast advances of the virus , the government ruled that all classes in all institutions   would be virtual until the end of the year . 

 The challenge in this case was to train suitable teachers and parents , or as they will be   called from now on "" clients "" , to be able to access virtual classes , since most teachers and   clients were not very familiar with the internet and the new technology it offers . 

 Selection 

 Starting with virtual classes through Youtube or Power Point with audios , allowed us to   collect information about how users felt about our service and how we can improve it .   Having the current knowledge , it can be seen that we used the Learning Launch tool , since   the pilot test ( videos and ppt ) was carried out and positive and negative information was   collected . The next step was to analyze the collected information , improve the service and   launch a new idea to the market as soon as possible . 

 Application 

 The company presented the case to us ; the pilot test had many negative comments .   Customers were unhappy with the service provided , they felt their money was not being   well invested . 

 In this company , ideas from collaborators are welcome , so after listening carefully to the   case and analyzing it , I suggested that the classes could be through one of the virtual   platforms that became popular in these times of quarantine ; In addition , so that clients   and teachers perceive that we care and are interested in them , I recommended making   video tutorials with very detailed instructions , both for teachers ( host ) and clients   ( participants ) , also   inductive meetings before the indicated dates of the new start of   classes in real time , this with the aim of helping and absolving doubts on both sides . 

 We coordinated with the computer and support area and then we proceeded to record   videos . For the teachers we recorded a tutorial being host , that is , how to create meetings ,   how to admit students , among others ; and for the clients , how to enter the platform   through the school 's intranet . In addition , a pdf was created so that they have the option   of reading the tutorial step by step about the same topics . 

 This information was found in the mail that we sent to both parties , including the dates   for grade - level scheduled meetings , from kindergarten to high school . Based on this   information , the second pilot test was launched . 

 The purpose of this set of ideas was to know whether the clients and teachers would adapt   to the new system or whether they would have complications , instead of just telling them   which platform would be used and that they should watch tutorials or read for their own ;   we made sure that both parties felt comfortable telling us their doubts , concerns or   suggestions if they had any . 

 Insight 

 Both parties agree that virtual classes are not comparable to face - to - face classes , so we   reiterate our greater commitment to cover these gaps or at least minimizing them as much   as possible . After starting the virtual classes through this new modality , we received   positive feedback through the intranet and our social networks . The clients were satisfied   and delighted with this new service . They feel empowered , as they begin to master a new   and great level of technology as the internet is . This allowed us to define the modality   where the classes will be worked until the end of the year . 

 From the beginning of these new classes , there was a follow - up for a certain period of   time . Then , another meeting was scheduled to find out how both parties had done during   this time , again receiving positive feedback . 

 Approach 

 There still are issues to improve , such as some problems commented by customers and   the computer and support area , so we will continue analyzing and looking for ways to   continue offering a good service and do not lose the added value for which we are known .

"Challenge 

 I am working at a customer support center as a Training Manager . Our team of consultants is spread   across 4 locations within 2 countries , serving customers in a few different lines of business via 3   channels of support - emails , chats and voice . In the recent 3 months our tenured associates were   struggling to achieve their CSAT ( customer satisfaction ) metrics . After a deep dive analysis performed   by the Customer Experience department ,   a list of top offenders was identified - showing that the   entire team 's performance was driven down mainly by our usual top performers when it comes to   working with a fast temp and handling multiple customer cases as the same time , working on   different LOBs and channels of support . We extracted randomly 30 % of all handled cases by the top   offenders and while reviewing how they were handled , it turned out that all policies were indeed   followed and cases were handled correctly , however customers often complained about associates   being rude , in a hurry , not listening carefully etc . 

 Selection & Application 

 The method we chose to apply is the Learning launch - we came up with the idea to form a "" Learning   Cafe ""   and having small groups of certain identified associates attend those learning sessions .   Content is targeting soft skills , however not in general , but rather in small pieces - diverse situations   based on customer scenarios are turned into activities for empathizing , paraphrasing , active   listening , asking probing questions . The event was planned as a workshop and not like a typical   classroom training . Tenured associates would n't be really happy to know they are being drawn back   to what they remember as a new hire class . Instead - we had the event as a workshop in order to   allow the flow of ideas and sharing of feedback from their side . 

 Prior to the first initiative dates , our Training team organized a meeting with the program manager   and the team managers of all enlisted employees . We asked the managers of what their expectations   are . 

 The workshop was first tested on one of the company locations - in order to gain an idea if it is   working and adjust whatever may not be optimal . We had 3 groups of between 5 and 10   participants , the workshop was for 2 days in a row , however only for 4 hours per day . The enrolled   attendees were asked to bring some sweets or whatever they would like , additionally we also spared   a small amount to have some cup cakes etc . bought just in case nobody would bring anything . We   had a special approval taken by the program 's management in order to have food brought inside , as   this is usually not allowed . For our surprise , participants were so delighted by the idea and brought in   home - made cake and brownies etc . , so there was even more food than what people could eat .    Activities were engaging for everyone and despite a first wave of suspicious thoughts by the team   members , they actually managed to welcome the time spent during the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> with an open   mind and to participate actively in everything planned . The atmosphere was absolutely positive and   friendly , we had a lot of funny pictures made during the event . Additionally , each participant   received a special certificate of participation , which they quite enjoyed . We also released a survey by   the end of each workshop batch to gather the feedback , opinions and suggestions of the attendees . 

 Insight 

 The results of this initiative were truly amazing and a positive surprise for many of the stakeholders : 

 1 . We tracked performance of the associates within a month after they attended the workshops and   the average improvement in the CSAT metric is 3 % . 

 2 . Analyzing the survey results , we measured 96 % of NPS ; 98 % of participants stated they have   actually learned something new ; 100 % of the employees stated they would gladly participate in next   editions of the initiative as well . Verbatim - was an astonishing success ! 

 3 . People even uploaded photos with their certificates on social media . Some employees proactively   asked the trainer , who facilitated the event about the next possible session and wanted to be on the   list for it . Apparently , consultants from the test location also shared this with team members on the   other sites and they went asking their Training team POC about the initiative as well . 

 Additionally , after seeing which activities work best during the test phase , we adjusted slightly some   of the planned materials , so could better fit into the dedicated time frame . 

 Approach 

 Currently , we are on the planning stage for the next events of the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> series . The   workshops will be conducted on 2 other company locations within a month as of now , again 3 groups   on each site . We will continue measuring the results and analyzing the feedback from all parties . If   the initiative is proven to be a success when delivered on all 4 company locations , we would plan it   going forward for every quarter .

"Design Thinking Final Assignment 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I am a member of our Data Analysis team in a small organization where part of my role is to produce   monthly reporting for various lines of business .   This reporting has been going on for many years without   change or modification to them .   Recently it has been discovered these reports are generated and   distributed but are not being consumed . They contain detail information for each line of business   containing month to date , year to date , month over month and year over year comparisons for both   financial and total product quantity information and distributed to all stakeholders . Our challenge is to   make the reports easily consumable and relevant for the stakeholders .   Our Data team is moderately small   and was given until the next reporting cycle to come up with a solution . For this I will be using the Mind   Mapping tool of Design Thinking . 

 Application 

 I began looking at all of the most recent reports and started to pull out key pieces of information and   began placing them on poster boards , this was done by enlarging some pieces of the reports .   Next , we   printed out multiply copies of the reports and placed them on tables in the boardroom , with pads of paper   and markers .   We invited all stakeholders into the board room for a casual discussion on the current state   of the reports .   All stakeholders were invited to walk around the boardroom and look at the key pieces of   information enlarged on the poster boards .   Afterwards the stakeholders reviewed the current reports   and made markings on them outlining which information was important to them and what they would   like to see .   Once this was complete , we regrouped to review the findings .   Since the group of stakeholders   and Data team are small ( under 10 ) we regrouped into only one group .   We had each stakeholder share   their changes and information they wanted to see on the reports .   After each stakeholder had taken their   turn , we turned this into a round table discussion while a member from the Data team took notes on the   white board .   Once the round table discussion was finished , the Data team took all the marked - up reports   and notes from the white board .   We used these to make a complete redesign of the current reports . 

 <NAME> 

 By using the Mind Mapping tool , this allowed me and the rest of the Data team to gather <NAME> insights   from the users of the reports as to why the reports were not being consumed and what information was   important to them on a monthly basis .   By combining the information on the marked - up reports and notes   from the round table discussion it was clear to see the stakeholders wanted to see high level data with   some visuals to make the reports easy to consume , with the needed detailed reports in the last few pages   of the reports if they needed to review the detail .   This has also shown the need to have dashboards   created from the reports .   This Design Thinking tool was a great approach to understand why the current   process of reporting just was n’t working and allowed the data team to get firsthand insights from the   users . 

 Approach 

 The Mind Mapping tool was the right approach to tackle this challenge , it allowed us to gather insights   and understand what the end user needed .   The most valuable portion of this process was gaining the   firsthand insights from the stakeholders during the round table discussion .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge and selection 

 I am a student at a university in <ADDRESS> and I participate in an internal entrepreneurship contest . In   this case , my team and I ( an administrator , an anthropologist , a graphic designer , a social worker ,   and a criminal lawyer ) have to work based on the lines of action of the university social   responsibility approach , from which we choose the reduction of all forms of inequity and justice .   Thus , the proposed challenge was to provide adequate access to justice to women victims of   family violence , who lodged the complaint against their partner or family member and did not   follow up on it due to a matter of time or because they believed that the measures taken by the   respective authorities were ineffective . Thus , we use different tools to propose a solution to this   problem , which I will list below : first , we empathize with the victims of violence , conducting in- depth interviews ( with women who had successfully faced the complaint process and had   protection measures necessary so that , by providing information , your life is in danger ) , through   which we sought to understand your needs and pain points throughout the complaint process . As   a result , we found that the majority resigned themselves to leaving the process due to the   treatment of the officers in the police station ( they did not pay attention to them , minimized their   situation , or simply justified the actions of the aggressor , because , as is well known , in my country   violence against women and machismo abound ) , while it took the woman to be in court to present   a complaint ( the person could wait up to 6 hours for a judge to attend to her ) , and the measures   inefficient protection measures that were dictated in their favor , since the police did not ensure   that they were complied with . 

 Second , we interviewed members of a family police station ( which are in charge of dealing with   situations of family and child violence ) , to empathize with the police and analyze their   participation in the complaint process . They told us that , since there were few police stations of   this type , they could not cope , because only in that police station there were 3,000 restraining   orders and they could not attend to all of them or see if the measures were effectively carried out .   They also told us that there are times when the complainant withdrew the complaint and returned   with her partner , either due to threats or of her own free will . Finally , they told us that people did   not use the emergency telephone number , which could help the police to help a woman in   distress . 

 In this sense , after using a series of tools such as the customer journey map ( to map the complaint   process from the perspective of the victims and see what the pain points were ) , storytelling ( to   show the judges the problem and the relevance of having a solution ) , and to use the website   called Marvel App to design an application that would allow us to facilitate access to the complaint   process for victims of family complaints ( among other functionalities ) , we decided to proceed to   use the tool called <NAME> <NAME> , which consists , in summary , in performing the testing of the   innovative idea developed from the three previous processes ( what is , what if , what wows ) in a   small sample in relation to the total market to test our hypotheses , see if it is works , and direct the   idea to the needs of the client or discard the idea 

 Application 

 I begin the process with a sample of ten people , who access the design remotely with their cell   phones and these have transitions to provide the client with an immersive experience in the   application . At first , people come across the registration form , through which they have to register   with their DNI number . After that , people will be able to see a map on which they can notice their   location and the police patrols that are near their location . They quickly identify a large red button ,   which is the emergency button , a button that they can dial so that the police will come to their aid   instead of calling the emergency telephone number . Likewise , they manage to notice a button   with three horizontal bars in the upper left corner , which opens a menu with the different   functionalities that the application offers them . First , they look at the button "" How is my process   going ? Follow the complaint process "" . After pressing it , they find a map of the different complaint   processes with different symbols and colors with a legend at the bottom : red is for completed   processes , green for processes that are in progress , and brown for processes that are still in   progress . slopes . 

 Later , when returning to the menu with the different functionalities of the application , they notice   the second button , "" Where to turn ? : it provides information on the Women 's Emergency Center   and Shelters . "" After pressing this button , they find two file download links . The first is a directory   with locations of the different Women 's Emergency Centers in the country , and the other is a   directory with locations of the different existing shelters in <ADDRESS> . 

 After returning to the menu , you may notice that there is another button called “ Relevant legal   information ” . This button contains two tabs , which are "" My Rights "" ( it contains information on the   different laws in the country that protect it from any type of discrimination and the right to due   process ) , and "" My protection measures "" ( it contains relevant information on the different   protection measures that the victim may require after having been violated ) . 

 The participants return to the main menu and see the fourth feature called “ Check it out ” , which is   a platform on which they can upload multimedia content , whether audio or video , that works as   evidence that the victim suffered violence , which are sent to the court for further analysis . 

 Finally , the "" Contact Us "" button , which is used to directly contact the police or the Women 's   Emergency Centers in case of emergency and urgently need protection and shelter . 

 The testing was carried out remotely for an average of one hour , during which time the different   functionalities were explained to the attendees and obtaining feedback that enriches our   platform . 

 Also , we were able to test our idea on a small sample without spending a lot of money , as we used   very easy - to - use tools at no cost other than our time . However , we believe that we learned a lot   from that experience . 

 Insight & Approach 

 First , our hypotheses were validated and correct . All the participants were satisfied with the   application , as they considered it a useful tool to get closer to the police , attend their complaint   processes without wasting 6 hours in a court waiting to see the status of their complaint process ,   and provided information important information about how to access places of support and how   to enforce my rights . 

 However , they considered that it was unrealistic and not very scalable , since our country is not   characterized by having an efficient or digitized system . In order to remotely track the complaint ,   the judges or assistants constantly update the status of the complaint , a structural aspect that is   very difficult to change . Likewise , although we solved the problem of rapid communication with   the case of complaint , we did not consider the capacity of the police officers to respond to calls for   help through the emergency buttons , since they could not be able to cope with so many calls .   Finally , they considered that the majority of people who suffer from violence against women are   in a state of poverty or extreme poverty , so our project may not have any effect on our target   audience , as they may not have the internet to access the application . We find this last opinion   valuable , but it was not evident in the statistics we collect on the use of cell phones in our country .   However , we came up with the idea of making an offline version that can help people make a call   for help without the need for internet . 

 Likewise , in terms of the interface , they told us that this was confusing in the complaint process   part , as it had many steps and more texts than images . This aspect will be something that we will   improve to make a better application . 

 Subsequently , we plan to make a prototype with a friendlier version of the platform and with   people with a socioeconomic level C and D ( people in poverty ) , and not with B ( people with   average income ) . 

 Finally , by way of conclusion , I must emphasize that testing the final product has been a rewarding   experience , since it allowed us to empathize more with people and make visible points that we   had completely ignored , an aspect that allows us to deliver a better product to the contest and the   possibility of receiving financing to make this project a reality . However , we need to work together   with the government , since there are structural aspects that we need to change

"<NAME> <NAME> YOUR PERSPECTIVE 

 CHALLENGE 

 We use visualization all the time in our lives , sometimes without even notice it , as a   photographer , visualization It is the key for my job , because it literally depends on it . I   had an idea as a result of this crisis , it was to do photoshoots for small businesses that   were creating everywhere in my city , but the problem was that there were too many   businesses ideas that looked similar , I could n’t imagine different ideas for every   business´s photoshoot and I was not very familiarized to work only with products and   not with models and for the first time I was out of my comfort zone , as the time passed   the problems were increasing because I had to send the photos already , the clients   could n’t express their ideas either . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 The most logical solution for those problems was visualization , that tool helped me to   include my clients into the ideas that they wanted but also it helped me to connect to   their perception of what their products mean to them . In the first place we start to do   sketches of what was the message behind it , some of them wanted to express a nice   experience , having a good time or simply just to make people support them , that ’s when   I realized that I needed to use design thinking because of the empathy that people   needed during this time . 

 APPLICATION 

 I started using this tool by sketching what they wanted to communicate , most important   how we were going to express that in those pictures , the second thing that I did was to   show them pictures about   how colors express emotions , we made some color pallets for   the photoshoot and we began to make some draws about the position of the product in   the hole scenario , and for the final step we made diagrams about all the things put   together so they could agree on the result . This tool was so helpful and very effective   for that situation , most of the time it seems so obvious but at the moment that you   needed it could not be as visible as we thought . 

 INSIGHT 

 The experience that I had applying that tool was so satisfactory even if that just   represents a small part of the design thinking , I really felt that I was n’t just doing a   photoshoot , instead I felt that I did a connection with those people and also change my   perspective about how should I do my photoshoots , it made my mind more open about   new ideas by asking the people that were involve in the photoshoot , maybe not in the   photos but their essence so that could make those photos unique . Visualization has   always been in my work , but now I can see it clearly . 

 APPROACH 

 Obviously design thinking is a very unknown world to discover but because of that it   gives us a lot of new opportunities and possibilities , there were many tools that I could   have applied in my situation but the one that I used worked perfectly , I would add   another one for my next projects and that would be storytelling , because I believe that   photos not only express messages , it also tells stories from the people behind that   product , it would be fascinating to make people understand and connect with that kind   of stories , stories about empowerment and not giving up in this situation of crisis , just in   that way we could all empathize with each other but also using the most important part   for me of the design thinking , that tool just like the others are very helpful not only for   the person who is using it , but also for the clients that are finally being seen as humans   and not just clients .

"Assignment : 

 Challenge & Selection : 

 I am related to healthcare ﬁeld that gives me access to encounter a number of situation in daily   life . As a teacher by profession , in healthcare ﬁeld , I am suppose to teach students the various   scenario of patient care . Because of the COVID 19 outbreak , we are unable to get practical   exposure to hospitals . The challenge that faced us was lack of accessibiity to the patient , that led   us limited understanding of the subject discussed in the class taken through online mode . I have   take the visualisation technique for understanding the subject of remote patient monitoring in the   situation , its key areas of concern and handling of emergencies . 

 Application : 

 I started the session with visualisation of a member of the family as a patient . The students are   then suppose to make a list of activities which are required for monitoring the patient at home .   The students then take the help of their previous experience and interview if the family members   to ﬁgure out the list of assistance required to the patient from the patient ’s point of view . 2 - 3   interview of the healthcare professionals like nurses and doctors were also taken to list down the   activities to be done from the hospital point of view . Th responses from the patient and patient   family members were kept separate from that of the healthcare professionals . 

 The questions asked where : 1 ) What are the activities which require maximum assistance to the   patient ? 2 ) Do the patient and the hospital has a good remote monitoring system for 24 hours   monitoring of the patient ? 3 ) Was the assistance provided by the hospital satisfactory for the patient ? 4 ) What do you think will improve the monitoring and assistance given by the hospital ? 

 A time frame of 30 minutes is given to each respondents to answer the questions . Based upon   the answer the pattern in each type of response is being clubbed together , separate for hospital   and patient -side respondents . After the session , a poster is being prepared that shows the major   shared isights among the respondents and what are the agreed solution given by   both the   groups . 

 Insights and <NAME> : 

 The main learning from the exercise was that we were able to pint out some speciﬁc problems   and solutions from the interview , and we were looking forward about “ What s ’ next ” . We were   eager to experiment the implementation of each solution and if it gave us promising results . It was   easy for understanding the root of the problem and also the list of solutions available , even   though each students was staying in a far oﬀ place . It depicted that as we shared the ﬁnding of   our interview , we learned various insights into the problem like , accessibility of data , care at the   time of emergency and medication error was some of the common grounds where   experimentation was required . 

 I will deﬁnitely use visualisation techniques in my further learning activities in design . 

"
"The use of <NAME>          The instrument I used was the visualization tool to achieve a better understanding , since it   is understood up to 60,000 times faster than any text and thus achieve different points of   view , obtaining a better solution to problems or a shared solution .        Request        it is most commonly used for problem situations , providing better ideas as we thus achieve   more results and better responses to different points of view .      My problem situation focuses on the use of the tics that are of utmost importance when   taking or implementing virtual classes and thus provide good quality when receiving classes ,   which will use a questionnaire looking for the shortcomings presented by teachers   u   students who may are unfamiliar with the use or implementation of tics . I will take as an   example the students of the NTU ( Cúcuta Colombia )   implementing a series of questions such as : Have you used any virtual platform to receive   classes   ?   Or How much do you know about virtual platforms when receiving classes ?   Obtaining multiple results for these two questions , of which many students showed   misinformation about the use of tics , which does not generate the problem to be solved .      Many teachers who for years have taught their classes in person were forced to evolve in   terms of managing their virtual classes , receiving training which was very helpful since ,   through a survey carried out on a number of students , they showed disagreement about how   their teachers   towards the methodology or practice of the class .      Due to this problem , a survey was created for a part of the students with questions such as :   Would you receive from the experts in the subject of class management virtually any type of   training to know how to use digital platforms when taking classes   ? obtaining a positive   result for this question and thus generating a number of responses to obtain the expected   result for said problem , generating a positive response to the implementation and use of tics .        Perspective and focus        With this tool you can learn that it is very useful when it comes to knowing multiple points of   view of a situation , obtaining positive results and different observations , thus generating a   better understanding of the problem and innovating with respect to what is needed .

"<NAME> 

 By <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge 

 I worked in a pharmaceutical laboratory that had a new drug that made it to the market   place after many , many years in research , clinical trials and production testing .   We had   just moved into a newly built building and there was much excitement and   overwhelming demand to know about the product and building .   The company ’s   directors decided that it would be good to do an “ Open House ” with tours to inform the   public , interested journalists , professionals in the industry as well as many schools that   wanted to educate their students what a career in pharmaceuticals would be like . 

 I was tasked with heading up a team to prepare a tour of the research and development   laboratory .   The directors stressed that they wanted to get across what happens in the   laboratory and to explain and show what kind of science and cutting edge technology   we used .   This was a challenging task since the tours were short , with large groups   coming through .   The greatest part of challenge would be to convey the information so   that comprehension to all ages & levels of education was obtained but that those with   high and low understanding of science and technology were also engaged and not   bored . 

 Selection 

 I quickly came to realization that the visualization design tool would be a necessity in   our “ What Is ? ” challenge to tackle , as described above . Our team agreed that   visualization , which is the use of charts , photographs , diagrams , handouts , etc , would   be a powerful design tool to incorporate .   With tours being too short to adequately   convey the science and technology we used on a daily basis in the laboratory , as well   as the description of scientific terms , processes and how the instruments work , it would   be daunting to go without this tool . The use of visuals , along with auditory part of the   tour , would be able to adequately spread information to address all levels of   understanding . 

 Application 

 Our group decided upon highlighting 3 important functions within the laboratory and   allotted each tour guide 3 - 4 minutes to explain these topics and leave time to answer a   few questions so that we did not go over the 15 minute time limit .   We broke up into mini   groups of 2 to brainstorm each function and answer the “ What If ? ” of this challenge .    Each group obtained or created visuals along with description of terms used and came   back together to put complete a small handout . 

 Use of a cycle diagram gave way to quick understanding to all the overall processes   that happens with a drug upon entering to exiting our laboratory . A mind mapping visual   helped show what a R&D laboratory technologist does & the required skills needed to   do the job . Finally , a basic schematic and photograph of the most used instrument ,   labeled with terms , helped visualize the inside workings of the machine and what it does   to the drug . 

 Insight 

 Upon returning from our mini groups of 2 , we handed our information to the other mini   groups to critique and to add or edit any information .   This new insight helped give   another perspective to “ What Wows ? ” and how to revise to make it easy to comprehend   for those with low science understanding yet challenge those with higher understanding   as well as educate all the students who wanted to learn about careers . 

 The other group members helped by suggesting more colors in the visuals to have it   stand out and easy to identify .    We used different colored paper to separate the 3   topics .   We also used a visual of how a car uses gasoline as comparison alongside the   instrument schematic to better get across comprehension of how the machine worked .    We added supplementary reading , terms and links to websites for those who wanted   further reading . From start to finish , the visualization design tool gave a handout that   helped those follow along visually with our auditory part of the tour as well as showing   the real life instruments in the lab . 

 Approach 

 We had a follow up meeting to discuss .   With the time allotted near the end of the tour   for questions from the tour members , we were better able to understand what needed   better clarification or what needed more information due to interest .   The tour members   would point and follow along to the visuals as well as use it to ask questions at the end ,   which confirmed visualization was the tool for “ What Works ? ” with this challenge . 

 In addition , we agreed that a mini questionnaire added to the end of the handout , to be   hand in anonymously at the end of the tours , could help give insight to what worked or   did n’t work to help curate for future tours .

"STORY TELLING 

 Challenge :   I am running a non - profit organization with the aim of reducing illiteracy among individuals I work   with the rural uneducated and economically disadvantaged people .They face a lot of hardships in   their life and are forced to become child labour , losing   all the freedom from exploring different   colours of life .They need to be motivated and guided in their life for their upliftment .Education   must be provided   to them so that they can explore wide range of opportunities in their lives by   doing smart work . 

 Selection :   Story telling   is a prominent   tool that I use all the time <NAME> telling is a tool that we can use as a   designers to get insight into users , build empathy and reach them emotionally . I had selected this   tool as it appropriate to empathize with the children and their parents . It is also best tool   to inspire   them with the stories of great personalities   & real life situations   that had occurred in our lives and   how we had overcome it .I started narrating different stories to them by asking them to gather at   one place . I   used to the feedback given by them against to the story to understand their interest   and thought process which gives solution to my challenge . 

 Application :   Considering the feedback given by the children & their parents towards the story , I worked with   members of the organization , conduct brainstorm sessions and come to conclusion to adopt   different strategies & approaches   to educate them .We have provided personal assistance to few   people as required to them at this situation .We have built a coaching shelter hire good faculty   to   assist & educate them . Initially , few children have stepped forward enthusiastically & attend the   classes . As days passed , one by one , strength of the children aspiring for the education as increased   rapidly . Finally , we have got an overwhelmed response from children & their parents . 

 Insight :   Minding blowing ! . By narrating situations we faced in our lives as stories that match their situations   we are able guide them in their lifes by providing education which them to set their goals and   achieve their dreams . As a results , illiteracy is reduced benefiting their generations . 

 Approach :   By connecting to the children and their parents in the rural areas using story telling tool , it had a big   impact on the life style of the people    living   there as they had set their goals in their life by steeping   forward to get educated and explore different colours of life 

 The story telling tool had worked excellently & in upcoming challenges I will use this tool & think of   stories that will assist me in presenting my ideas & best illuminate target group of people

"Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am a member of a small company made up of 13 people , so our tasks are varied ,   we are in charge of marketing , management , finance and other things . 

 We will use the mind mapping tool to bring together as a team and connect ideas   that will lead us to more creative solutions in the development of our product design . 

 Selection 

 The mind mapping tool is a diagram used to represent ideas , words , tasks and   concepts together , represented radially around a central idea or keyword that   consists of looking for patterns and insights in the large amount of data collected . 

 Application 

 For the application of this tool , first we decided where we were going to do it , it had   to be a place where there were no interruptions , spacious and comfortable , since we   found a suitable place , we have to capture the ideas ( once the necessary information   was collected and reasoning the information ) equipping our participants with pen ,   sticky notes , among others . All this process dialoguing with the other members ,   asking them to write down any element they think is necessary , then we analyze   what would be useful and what is not , after the participants have made observations ,   the next step was to ask the participants what is next , until new valuable ideas arise   and we write the personal statements on bigger sticky notes and place them on the   corresponding groups of sticky notes , then we made the participants observe the   connections between the groups to achieve a better representation of "" what is "" . 

 Insight 

 Applying the mind map tool exceeded our expectations and were much better than   we thought , since having new ideas , discussing them and capturing them using this   tool would have good results , but these were better since they helped us to highlight   those main ideas that we all thought about , but did not know how to capture them . 

 Approach 

 Since my team and I have used this tool a lot and it is very familiar , it worked very   well , however we had several mishaps with the issue of organization , since everyone   had to participate and in order , but then we achieved a good organization with the   participants . 

 In future occasions that we use this tool we will have practice and we will know how   to use it in a more efficient way .

"Reflection -   Storytelling    by <NAME> <NAME> – 27 October 2019     Challenge      Working for a large organization that has recently gone through a change in Senior <NAME> and the   implementation of a new software application has caused an impact on employee ’s morale , productivity and an   increase in absenteeism .      Our challenge / task as the Human Resource team was to help gain insight into how employees are truly feeling and   look at ways in which we can improve not only the company ’s culture and engagement , but ensure that employees   feel valued and appreciated .      Selection and Application     In collaboration with the company ’s in - house marketing and digital department , we decided to put together a video   that told a very simplistic story of the company ’s strategy , vision and importance of digital transformation .       The purpose of creating a video was to create consistency for all line managers by ensuring that every line manager   delivered the same story when engaging with their staff .     This powerful video was used as a story - telling tool to initiate monthly engagement / café conversation sessions with   their respective teams in order to collectively rebuild / transform the company ’s DNA .     At every engagement session held , the following was noted . 

 1 )   Concern(s)/theme 

 2 )   Agreed action 

 3 )   Execution 

 After 4 months of running these engagement sessions , HR conducted a very brief ADKAR assessment ( Awareness ,   <ADDRESS> , Knowledge , Ability and Reinforcement ) with staff and line managers to assess and diagnose any gaps .     Insight and Approach     Out of the 3000 employees who have been engaged : -      65 % of employees welcomed the video . They had a better understanding as to the business need in preparing the   workforce for the upcoming digital transformation era and felt very excited and positive about the future and the   possible new opportunities that would exist within the company .       <ADDRESS> having a better understanding , there was a great need to invest in the development of people across the   organization .   Focused development for each individual is currently being put in place and there is a huge drive for   continuous learning across the organization being implemented .     15 % of the employees engaged , felt it important to have a home/ work life balance . They felt burnt out as a result of   their perceived need to put in extra hours in fear of losing their jobs .   Various social / connect sessions have been put   in place across teams for social interactions over lunch time and to encourage celebrating internal victories in order   to boost team morale .     20 % of employees felt it important to introduce flexible working hours .   Some departments are already practicing this   within their respective teams . Other departments , however , are currently putting frameworks in place to find ways of   implementing the concept of flexible work across all teams .     The feedback received from the engagement session worked really well .   It provided great insights in implementing   targeted initiatives for the employees . ( as mentioned above )     What has not worked very well is the inconsistent application of flexible working hours across the organization .   This has   created a sense of unfairness across teams . To address this concern , the Human Resource Department and the   Industrial Relations Department is currently putting together an official company “ flexible work from home policy ” .   ( Currently being developed )       I ’m very new to the world of Innovation and this course has really opened up my mind in approaching things   differently . WOW … I had no idea how powerful storytelling could be !   By applying storytelling in our organization , it   allowed management to really connect with their staff .   Employees felt heard , they felt engaged and they realized   that management themselves were going through the same mixed emotions as they were .   One of the line managers   said to this to his team “ Team , we are all “ Explorers ” … so let ’s explore together ” , He gave each of his staff members   an “ Explorer hat ” as a token to remind them that they were all on this change journey together .

"Final assignment overview 

 A. Challenge 

 My challenge is situated in following context . I am working as a project manager for a multinational food ingredient   supplier ( yes , chocolate that is ! ) .      Currently I am working on a cross functional project , where I will keep other elements confidential .   One of challenges is that , during the analysis phase of the project , our commercial Sales & Marketing teams have   indicated that they do n’t have a clear overview of our full chocolate product portfolio . The company ’s product   portfolio has grown significantly and became more complex over the last years , due to recent acquisitions in different   types of sweet ingredients .   Because of this , they miss the right information to propose relevant solutions to our customers . 

 B. Selection 

 We have used with our team two techniques is the overall design thinking toolbox , being :     1 . Overall design thinking process

 3 . What if : 

 Together with the core team , we tried to ideate around concepts and tools that could work , often our ideas   were expressed with no more than a drawing or one pager of the concept . 

 4 . What Wows : 

 For each of the selected concepts , we made a prototype , in the form of a visual impression on what the   product portfolio tool could look like . 

 5 . What <NAME> : 

 During our learning launch , we scored the different prototypes , according to criteria set forward by our   commercial teams . 

 2 . Learning Launch 

    We put the developed portfolio tools to the test , by organizing a learning launch in selected commercial team   meetings , as our test panel . 

    We have built - in a feedback form in the product portfolio website that we decided to go for . Being it only a   rough version of our final tool , this left us with enough time and budget to adjust and fine - tune our final   version . 

 D. <NAME> 

    The overall process reassured that our final ‘ customer ’ , i.e. the commercial team , was very closely involved   into design & execution of our solution . 

    Due to a reassured learning curve and spending the resources at the right time into the process , we managed   to deliver tangible results before our deadlines . 

    The learning launches provided us with timely feedback of the end - user , so we still had adequate time &   budget to readjust our final solution . 

 E. Approach 

    I had overall a great experience and learning curve , applying these concepts on a real life work situation . 

    Next time , I want to make this process more explicit to my fellow team members . The purpose would be to   make them better aware of the overall process we are following , as this was not explicit from the beginning .   This would provide them also with a wider perspective on the process . 

    I will continue to use the framework , as it helped us a lot to ensure speed to market and a customer relevant   tool .

"<NAME> <NAME> <NAME> 

 CHALLENGE : 

 After 25 years of work in FMCG company , I have just started my new job as a Product Manager in   outdoor company . I was responsible for Citylights ad network – several thousand of advertising ’s   panels ( 1,2 x 1,8 m ) located on cities streets , bus shelters , shopping malls , airports etc . 

 My first challenge was : make the existing advertising network called ‘ ITFAQ ’ start selling . 

 This advertising network consisting of 600 citylights , located near shops and on the parkings of the   largest retailers like Tesco , Carrefour etc , was dedicated to FMCG * advertisers . 

 The case was that at the beginning many clients ( media houses ) have included ‘ ITFAQ ’ to   campaign 's media - mix but at the end - nobody bought it . No one in the sales team could explain   the reason , why ? Price discounts or extra panels for free did n't work . 

 SELECTION : 

 I have decided to use Mind Mapping Tool , because the pivotal stage in my challenge was gathering   a deep understanding of customer needs and broader perspective on how this product should work   to be desired . 

 This tool allowed me to involve my colleagues , much more experienced in this industry than me , in   order to develop a common mind among them regarding the current reality of my challenge . 

 This tool was also used due to the very large amount of data I have collected and we had to draw   the most important facts and observations that would lead us to deeper insights . 

 APPLICATION : 

 In big conference room I have prepared the ‘ ITFAQ - gallery ’ – where people could saw and   feel how the citylights dedicated network looks like ( pictures of localization ) , who is our target   ( FMCG companies logos ) , who buy ( media houses logos ) , folders , charts , etc . 

 I have invited 15 people from sales , marketing , media planners ( customers ) and stakeholders like :   sales & HR & finance – directors . 

 I asked them for their intuition . Please go around the gallery on your own and make notes you   believe might inform new ideas . 

 As a next step , we gathered in 3 smaller groups - 5 people each and after several minutes of self- preparation each person from the team have started sharing their ideas by sticking notes on the   wall . 

 The next step was to turn these ideas and observations into deeper insights .    We did this in the   next workshop . 

 INSIGHT : 

 People were so involved , motivated and cooperative one to each other that it exceeded my   imagination .   I got a feedback that prepared ‘ Gallery ’ instead of static and boring powerpoint   presentation was as a trigger to look at this product from a different perspective , feel it . 

 The second positive thing was that the most influential people – the stakeholders – get involved   and cooperate and co - create in search of the best solution . 

 There was a series of insights that came out of it and finally lead to the big success of new   redesigned product . 

 The most powerful was discovering what our customers really want to buy . They want to buy an   audience responsible for shopping – and these are WOMEN , not FMCG . This led us later to change   the product name from ‘ ITFAQ ’ to ‘ City Ladies ’ . 

 The second discovery was that clients expected citylights network to follow the image of a modern ,   energetic woman . This led to the expansion of the places where the citylights were located – instead   of only shops , places such as hairdressers , beauty salons , shopping malls , kindergartens , were   chosen , which in a broader context referred to places where women can be found . 

 APPROACH : 

 I think that the tool was chosen correctly , as evidenced by the achieved goal . 

 I would definitely like to improve the technique of using this tool in the future - what I did before was   very intuitive and I have learned from the course that a step - by - step methodology is available . 

 I also think that in the future I will go through all the phases of the design thinking process - because   it ensures the highest quality of achievements . 

 * FMCG – Fast - Moving Consumer Goods – products that sell very quickly , such as food and drinks .

"Example Reﬂection - Learning Launch 

 Challenge I am part of a team which evaluates new   capabilities and products which should be built   by my Technology company . The challenge for   our team has been to promote innovation in the   organization and get more people to participate   in the process along with their regular jobs . The   objective is to generate new capabilities on a   consistent and scalable basis . While my organization has products which are   well received in the market place and are cash   cows , recent   technological changes and   advances have made innovation a core   objective . 

 Selection I selected <NAME> <NAME> as the tool to tackle   this challenge , and the primary reason was the   need to create lots of fast and cheap   experiments , and have this percolated to all   levels of the organization . While the other   thinking tools are appropriate for parts of our   challenge , but does not address the need for   enterprise - wide participation . 

 My primary reference is the Learning launch   video lecture by <NAME> <NAME> in Week 4 . 

 Application Our team created and announced a company- wide <ADDRESS> event , framed the rules of   participation and decided evaluation criteria .   Employees were allowed to spend 10 % of their   working time every week to prepare for this event .   They were encouraged to work on products   outside their daily work . Each self - selecting team   should have a minimum number of cross- functional members , and the depth of their   collaboration was one of the evaluation criteria . The core of this innovation was about   understanding the customer ’s needs , their   journeys and pain points they face . Each team had   to take a few of these customer insights and   create a hypothesis about how they will solve this   problem . Most of the organization was energized and we   witnessed nearly 100 different teams participating   in this challenge . The ﬁrst gate was about   identifying which of these hypotheses / ideas were   solvable , and had a large potential market to be   captured . We had to keep a high bar here as the   next step involved more resources , and many 

 teams qualiﬁed . The next step was actually creating a prototype   which can be tested with customers , and their   feedback and insights captured . These teams had   to present their prototype to the Executives along   with customer feedback and their insights . Finally ,   a handful of ideas were selected to be   productized , and the remaining were kept for   future usage . 

 Insight Learning launch is a valuable tool for us , and the   customer insights has been especially useful .   They were enthused as their opinion was sought   and they had the potential to inﬂuence the   product . Disconﬁrming facts have been very effective as   they weeded out a lot of ideas which did not have   sufﬁcient depth of real data . Overall , our design thinking initiatives were very   successful , and we can see the potential for more   such tools to be used across our business . 

 Approach One of the issues we had was that people became   really passionate about THEIR idea , and the   rejection was not taken up well . We need to 

 educate the value of generating ideas even if they   do not get selected . All people involved in this   exercise should be celebrated in a much better   way . The other issue was that the challenge was   deﬁned very broadly , and so we had people   participating in areas which were completely   outside their expert areas . In the future , we might   focus the challenge around our existing product   lines and add a few new products , as we need   product owners to act as guardians .

	   it 	   is 	    and 	   why 	   you 	   selected 	   it 	   for 	   your 	   challenge , 	   including 	   any 	   appropriate 	   video 	   lecture 	    references 	    The 	    selected 	    tool 	    is 	    Visualization . 	   This 	    tool 	    facilitates 	    the 	    aim 	    of 	    a 	    common 	    and 	    comprehensive 	   understanding 	   of 	   a 	   problem . 	   Moreover , 	   the 	   culture 	   level 	   and 	   the 	    ability 	    of 	    communicate 	    themselves 	    could 	    be 	    very 	    different 	    depending 	    on 	    the 	    stakeholder 	   considered , 	   their 	   expertise 	   and 	   they 	   background . 	   So , 	   evidence 	   based 	    on 	   images , 	   symbols , 	   photos , 	   or 	   similar , 	   helps 	   to 	   summarize , 	   focus 	   on 	   the 	   concept 	   or 	    idea 	   to 	   work 	   with , 	   and 	   to 	   express , 	   even 	   to 	   report , 	   personal 	   situations 	   detected 	   by 	    them 	    ( for 	    instance , 	    by 	    users , 	    at 	    home ) . 	    This 	    tool 	    also 	    fosters 	    the 	    stakeholders 	    participation . 	    At 	    the 	    same 	    time , 	    it 	    favors 	    the 	    common 	    understanding 	    when 	    someone 	   expresses 	   an 	   idea 	   or 	   concept , 	   helping 	   to 	   assure 	   the 	   comprehension 	   of 	   this 	    term . 	  	    The 	   later 	   reflections 	   based 	   on 	   those 	   photos , 	   individually 	   and 	   collectively 	   improve 	    the 	    project , 	    approaching 	    the 	    reality 	    to 	    researchers 	    and 	    practitioners 	    in 	    an 	    imaginative 	    and 	    creative 	    way . 	    It 	    allows 	    to 	    use 	    the 	    whole 	    brain 	    for 	    better 	    and 	    unexpected 	   connections 	   that 	   find 	   different 	   solutions 	   ( as 	   <NAME> <NAME> 	   said 	   in 	   her 	    video-­‐intervention 	   describing 	   the 	   tool ) . 	   	    3 . 	   Application : 	   Describe 	   how 	   you 	   applied 	   the 	   tool 	   you 	   selected 	   to 	   your 	   challenge 	    ( whay 	   you 	   did 	   and 	   how 	   the 	   tool 	   was 	   applied 	   effectively 	   or 	   ineffectively ) 	    In 	   the 	   Project , 	   visualization 	   was 	   applied 	   through 	   photographs , 	   taken 	   by 	   the 	   own 	    participants , 	    to 	    express 	    graphically 	    their 	    concerns , 	    lacks 	    or 	    problems 	    related 	    to 	    their 	    perception 	    of 	    workplace 	    comfort . 	    These 	    photos 	    would 	    later 	    be 	    used 	    as 	    vehicles 	    to 	    trigger 	    their 	    storytelling 	    about 	    their 	    perception , 	    and 	    also 	    <NAME> 	    debates 	   among 	   participants , 	   to 	   consense 	   ideas 	   or 	   concepts 	   to 	   work 	   with , 	   and 	   later , 	    propose 	   solutions . 	  	    The 	   participants 	   were 	   15 , 	   divided 	   in 	   3 	   groups 	   of 	   5 	   each , 	   according 	   to 	   their 	   building 	    and 	   energy 	   knowledge . 	   All 	   of 	   them 	   evaluated 	   and 	   debate 	   on 	   the 	   whole 	   of 	   photos 	    taken 	    ( more 	    than 	    50 ) , 	    and 	    in 	    groups , 	    their 	    chose 	    their 	    representative 	    ones , 	    explained 	    to 	    the 	    rest 	    of 	    the 	    group 	    why , 	    and 	    searched 	    solutions 	    together , 	    categorizing 	   them 	   with 	   the 	   facilitator 	   ( me ) 	   help . 	    We 	    applied 	    this 	    tool , 	    a 	    kind 	    of 	    visualization 	    trough 	    participant 	    own-­‐photos , 	    because 	    it 	    had 	    the 	    power 	    of 	    give 	    objectivity 	    to 	    situations 	    that , 	    narrated 	    by 	    someone , 	   could 	   be 	   understood 	   as 	   exaggerated 	   or 	   just 	   distorsion-­‐perceived . 	   But 	   if 	    someone 	   takes 	   a 	   photo 	   of 	   a 	   particular 	   situation , 	   the 	   result 	   is 	   more 	   credible . 	   And 	    also , 	   to 	   use 	   those 	   images 	   as 	   triggers 	   of 	   debate , 	   critical 	   awareness , 	   and 	   search 	   of 	    solutions . 

 4 . 	   Insight : 	   describe 	   the 	   insight 	   you 	   gained 	   from 	   applying 	   the 	   tool 	   you 	   selected 	   to 	    your 	    challenge 	    ( how 	    an 	    insight 	    affected 	    your 	    thinking 	    about 	    the 	    challenge 	    and 	    about 	   design 	   thinking 	   more 	   broadly ) 	    Qualitative 	   approaches 	   offer 	   to 	   researchers 	   lots 	   of 	   insights 	   that 	   quantitative 	   can´t 	    do . 	    So 	    it 	    was 	    a 	    great 	    interest 	    to 	    choose 	    this 	    kind 	    of 	    approaches . 	    Specifically , 	    visualization 	    offered 	    the 	    possibility 	    to 	    work 	    with 	    people 	    with 	    different 	    studies 	    level , 	    building 	    comfort 	    and 	    energy 	    comprehension , 	    age , 	    and 	    interests . 	    It 	    was 	    a 	    challenge 	    for 	    them 	    ( also 	    for 	    researchers ) 	    wait 	    for 	    photo-­‐results 	    representing 	    something 	    so 	    abstract 	    such 	    as 	    “ comfort ” . 	    But 	    either 	    taking 	    their 	    own 	    photos , 	    or 	    debating 	   on 	   them , 	   it 	   was 	   very 	   helpful , 	   efficient , 	   and 	   grateful . 	  	    There 	   also 	   appeared 	   lots 	   of 	   insights , 	   for 	   instance 	   comfort 	   experts 	   that 	   worked 	   in 	    this 	   building , 	   and 	   who 	   were 	   part 	   of 	   those 	   participants , 	   “ forgive ” 	   in 	   some 	   way 	   all 	    the 	    comfort 	    lacks 	    that 	    they 	    also 	    suffered 	    as 	    users , 	    due 	    to 	    their 	    comprehensive 	    understanding 	    of 	    certain 	    building 	    circumstances . 	    It 	    was 	    very 	    surpresing 	    for 	    me , 	    because 	   I 	   hoped 	   a 	   more 	   critical 	   point 	   of 	   view . 	  	    Another 	    insight 	    was , 	    that 	    those 	    comfort 	    and 	    energy 	    experts , 	    due 	    to 	    their 	    discomfort 	   at 	   workplace , 	   needed 	   to 	   use 	   ( and 	   took 	   their 	   photos ) 	   about 	   non-­‐efficient 	    solutions 	    to 	    heat 	    their 	    internal 	    spaces , 	    for 	    instance . 	    When 	    their 	    explained 	    their 	    shoots , 	    the 	    argued 	    that 	    they 	    knew 	    that 	    behavior 	    was 	    not 	    proper 	    to 	    pursue 	    a 	    sustainable 	    waste 	    of 	    energy , 	    with 	    inefficient 	    solutions , 	    but 	    they 	    could 	    not 	    work 	    with 	   such 	   cold 	   indoors . 	  	   	    5 . 	   Approach : 	   Describe 	   what 	   you 	   might 	   do 	   differently 	   next 	   time-­‐ 	   applying 	   the 	   same 	    tool 	   you 	   selected 	   or 	   a 	   different 	   one-­‐and 	   the 	   reason(s ) 	   why . 	    I 	    think 	    this 	    tool 	    has 	    more 	    advantages 	    than 	    disadvantages . 	    But 	    in 	    a 	    workplace 	    environment , 	   their 	   application 	   has 	   to 	   be 	   followed 	   and 	   approved 	   by 	   the 	   institution 	    managers 	   or 	   directors , 	   and 	   also 	   by 	   department 	   chiefs , 	   to 	   avoid 	   mis-­‐understandings 	    on 	    what 	    are 	    shooted , 	    and 	    why . 	    If 	    not , 	    it 	    could 	    be 	    looked 	    with 	    distrust 	    and 	    suspicion . 	  	    Planification 	   is 	   also 	   very 	   important , 	   in 	   the 	   whole 	   process , 	   to 	   collect 	   data 	   ( photos 	    are 	    a 	    kind 	    of 	    qualitative 	    data , 	    as 	    well 	    as 	    storytelling ) , 	    the 	    way 	    to 	    communicate 	    facilitators 	   ( researchers ) 	   and 	   participants , 	   the 	   means 	   of 	   transfering 	   data 	   ( internet , 	    whatsapp 	   or 	   similar , 	   etc ) , 	   the 	   space 	   to 	   work 	   in , 	   the 	   number 	   of 	   sessions 	  	   and 	   tasks 	    to 	   do 	   during 	   each 	   one , 	   and 	   the 	   resources 	   to 	   facilitate 	   debate 	   ( press , 	   pcs , 	   screens , 	    pens 	   and 	   paper , 	   something 	   sweet 	   to 	   help 	   people 	   think 	   in 	   a 	   good 	   mood … ) . 	  	    Next 	    time 	    I 	    will 	    try 	    to 	    work 	    more 	    efficientlywith 	    photographs , 	    avoiding 	    silly 	    conversations 	   or 	   silent 	   gaps , 	   to 	   make 	   debates 	   shorter , 	   but 	   more 	   interesting .

"Reﬂection – Visualization 

 Selection 

 The best tool I have found for getting to shared vision and agreement on the problem space and   scope is Visualization . This has helped me with diverse groups with different backgrounds and   experience to better understand the problems and challenges before trying to deﬁne a solution . I   work for a large software and hardware company in identifying technology innovations for   customers and employees interacting for sales and customer service experiences . I have used   the technique of starting with a general description and then working with the group to further   reﬁne the existing journey . 

 Challenge 

 In the particular example I will describe below we were creating a virtual experience for   something that we currently delivered within our retail store . This experience was for helping   customers set up and get familiar with their new hardware purchase . The experience we were   trying to create was to take the same great experience that customers loved within our store but   allow them to have the experience in the comfort of their home or ofﬁce . 

 Application 

 I started the process by creating a quick journey map of the the high - level current store   experience to ground the group of the start and end of the experience we are addressing . I drew   a simple journey map on the board with points of each step in the journey . I was very careful to   keep it generic and not imply anything about customer feelings or opinions about the current   experience . I added pictures from our retail stores of customer going through the experience .   This brought the experience to life for the group . This is similar to what “ The Good Kitchen ”   used to help them understand what the employees and elderly were going through not just from   a functional perspective but also an emotional perspective . 

 At my company , creating an emotional experience is critical to the overall customer experience   and journey mapping helps with that process . It allows for us to take the base high - level   experience and continue to drill down with details so that everyone can share their perspective . 

 We took the initial journey map and I asked questions about each step to further reﬁne exactly   what both the customers and employees were doing at each step and what emotions they were   experiencing as they went through the journey . This was helpful to allow everyone to participate   and have their feedback heard . I use sticky notes for this purpose so that we could later   categorize them into logical groups as described by <NAME> <NAME> in the course video . 

 Insights & Approach 

 One difference from “ The Good Kitchen ” example is that we do not normally conduct customer   focus groups or talk to customers . We depend on our vision of the experience and creating what   we want the experience to be and then sharing that with the world . It has proven to be a   successful approach . I have used ethnographic research at two previous companies and found   that to be useful when applied to better understand the problem . At a previous software   company we called them “ follow - me home ” experiences which allowed us to see the customer 

 use our products in their home or ofﬁce and see ﬁrst hand the challenges they had in using the   products and have a dialogue about them . 

 That was one of the insights from this approach was that while we could use the gathered   customer feedback and our opinions about the experience , we really only had a partial picture   as we did not talk to customers . The other insight was about gathering input from a diverse   group of employees . We were all to have many different internal perspectives on the journey   which helped us form a fuller picture of the current experience to use as a baseline as we   moved through the design thinking process . I found this to be a successful approach and   everyone walked away from that session with a very good understanding of the current   experiences from several perspectives not just functional but emotional as well . I have used this   approach for several other projects and found it to be a great tool for getting people on the same   page .

"Design Thinking 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 The challenge that I will be undertaking is how to raise awareness about sustainability and its   importance to the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ( UAE ) . It is very important for us to establish such   understanding and vital role of thinking about sustainability and the environment as a priority . It is   crucial for us to adapt such thinking early on , as the UAE is a fairly young country at age . Having such   understanding will allow the UAE to be in the map of development of not only skyscrapers and touristic   attractions but also to showcase the positive correlation between development and the environment . 

 Being a young country that has n’t yet adapted a full policy of being environmentally friendly , there   needs to be a crucial and effective way to attract their attention on why such process needs to take   place . That is why , I have chosen the tool of visualization to prevail such message . Being a scientific   topic , I do n’t want people to get bored and drift away from the importance of such topic because of   numbers that might be proposed . Therefore , I believe with visualization having graphs and infographics   will allow them to understand and comprehend the importance of such mission to be adapted as a   policy and lifestyle to the UAE . When describing the power of the visualization tool , <NAME> <NAME> , she   described the tool in design as “ a way of unlocking a different part of the brain ” . I believe information   portrayed visually , is easier to comprehend , because you are allowing people to see what you want   them to see and understand . As she also elaborates , sometimes when we do n’t use visuals , different   people might be visualizing them internally differently . By using visuals , we can better understand the   idea and that results either in agreement or disagreement , and most importantly start a dialogue about   such topic because people see what the person is trying to advocate and portray . 

 First tactic when using visualization to promote sustainability , using well developed countries as   examples who have adapted it will allow the government to see the fruits of countries that are on board   and the benefits of such priority in development . An infographic of where the UAE , and specifically   <ADDRESS> , ranks in between all these well - developed city . For example , if we put the map of sustainable   cities based on the index generated by ARCADIS , <ADDRESS> ranks 52 on the list . Once the leaders and people   will take a look at the ranking , their eye will keep looking for <ADDRESS> ’s position on the list . Once going past   the 10th rank that will be worrying and concerning , considering that the culture in the UAE is to be   always number 1 . Therefore , such rank visualization will let initiate the thinking process and will allow   them to start thinking of “ why ? ” and look at the cities and countries that are in the frontier . That   thinking process is what ignites change and it would n’t be the same if we just put the whole report   generated in front of their eyes . The moment we highlight the first city and country that was the   highest , and where <ADDRESS> is ranked , that is when they will truly start to ask themselves the right   questions of why are we in that position and how can be in the frontline of such index . Moreover , the   pillars of sustainability that measure the sustainable index are as follows : people ( social ) , planet   ( environmental ) and profit ( economical ) . 

 For the second tactic , I had to get personal between the people and the leaders of the UAE . The leaders   in the UAE care greatly about the health of the people and their wellbeing . However , the reason the UAE 

 and <ADDRESS> are n’t in the frontier of the index is because there is a high rate of obesity found . Therefore ,   in order for us to get people thinking , we need to compare people that are living in <ADDRESS> and those   that are living in <ADDRESS> . That was made using a video that shows what the average citizen does in each   city from the moment he / she wakes up until they go to sleep . For the person that lives in <ADDRESS> , he / she   chooses to utilize public transportation , walk to and from near areas , eat healthy organic meals that are   enriched with nutrients , exercises lightly during the day , and reads in either between his / her breaks or   when going to bed . Whilst the citizen in <ADDRESS> , drives almost everywhere , eats highly processed meals   and rarely exercises . These portrayals will allow the leaders to understand why the UAE has twice   average of obesity and why it is n’t one of the highest ranked sustainable cities . Once they see such   numbers and visualization of the lives of the people residing in each city , later on they will understand   why these cities are pioneers in such development . 

 The insight gained from applying the tool of visualization allowed me to better understand and simplify   the complexity of my challenge , in order for other people that have little knowledge in the idea grasp   the goal of such mission . Visualization allowed me to think differently and look at the challenge from a   diverse viewpoint and see how different people think and the ways to attract them from their interest in   order to be able to convince them on the importance of achieving such goal . 

 Even though I believe that I have explained the process of implementing this mission using the   visualization tool , I believe various tools can achiever various results depending on the audience . For   example if we were to explain this mission to a younger generations I would use the storytelling tool or   mind mapping in order for me to be able to portray the whole message for them from start to finish .   Also , depending on what stage they are either in school or university , storytelling and mind mapping will   allow us to connect the idea with the foundation of education they are getting at the moment . The   depth that both these tools go to , will allow students to think about not only the present but also the   future and build on their past education .

"Reflection – Learning launch 

 CHALLENGE 

 In Pharmaceutical companies assuring reliability of analytical data is very critical . Pharmaceutical   companies use Chromatography a lot for testing of the products . Processing of chromatography data   in compliance to correct standard is very important to get right results . While there are lot of   technological solutions to maintain the integrity of data , still the data processing and audit trails have   to be reviewed for compliance to the procedures and regulatory guidelines . Review of entire data   package for one batch takes considerable time ( 2 - 3 hours ) as the data is often present in multiple   computer systems and the reviewer has to check more than 60 checkpoints . Apart from the quantum   of work , shear boredom due to repetitive nature of work , may result in reviewer missing or skipping   checks , resulting in error going unnoticed . This can have huge implication on the organization because   a batch with incorrect results may get into the market . Also there is risk of regulatory action if such   lapse is detected in regulatory audits which can have huge impact on the business . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 To overcome the above challenge the team decided to use of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> automation to perform   the review activity . Although the review process is quite complex , entire activity is performed against   set rules and overall activity can be broken down into small tasks and hence can be automated using   RPA . This solution has not been tried in industry yet and there is no readymade solution available .   Considering the significance of the activity and the solution being quite novel , Learning launch   approach was adopted to test the prototype . 

 APPLICATION 

 For first Learning launch , the team focussed on simplest category of test called Assay at one of the   manufacturing site of the company . This test was chosen as there is single peak in the chromatograms   of this test . Single peak makes evaluation of prototype easy although it performs all the checks which   are involved in multi peak analysis . Team defined all the checks which are required to be performed   and all the rules which need to be applied in verification data . Bot was built incorporating all these   rules . After initial trials on dummy data , the Bot was deployed on the live data . The outputs were   verified by performing manual checks of the same data . Challenge studies were also carried out by   intentionally creating incorrect processing situations which a reviewer is supposed to detect . Bot was   made to review such data and its ability to detect all the defective situations was verified by comparing   review findings of same data by qualified reviewers . Minor corrections in the Bot design were done   based on the outcomes of various simulations . 

 After successful deployment in single peak analysis , second Learning launch was performed on more   complex analytical method of Related substance test . While the checks and rules were same , this is   more complex activity due to presence of multiple peaks with varying peak areas and shapes . Due to   these complexities , the design of the challenge studies was more difficult . Also , the number of   challenge studies required to simulate all the possible errors was very high .   As in first Learning launch   the outcome of Bot were compared against the review findings of qualified reviewers 

 INSIGHT 

 Using the Learning launch tool , team could evaluate how the bot will perform in real life scenario . The   Learning launch also brought out some of the shortcomings of the initial design and helped in   optimization . Volume challenge performed as part of the launch proved initial assumptions of number   of bots required to be incorrect . The team could do more accurate estimation of the number of bots   required for deployment across the all the manufacturing sites . It also identified some opportunity   areas for process changes for elimination of Non Value adding Activities . All these insights helped team   to be better prepared for the organization wide roll out . Another important insight from the learning   launch was the team could identify more areas of using RPA in the QC laboratory . 

 APPROACH 

 While all tools of design thinking are useful at different stages of project , Learning launch is the most   appropriate one for testing the prototype before going live or for testing a new concept or design   before implementation on large scale . This can help in quick evaluation of whether the new design   will work . That way the team can decide to proceed further with the design , doing tweaking of the   design or kill the design before deploying too much resource . The insights gained during this launch   helped us in improving the prototype and helped in correct estimation of the resource requirement .   This learning will also help us in testing future designs before their rollouts .

"Reflection – Mind mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a marketing specialist , I deal with a large amount of data everyday . Knowing what   to do with all this data , and use it in the right way it ’s crucial for me . That ’s why I ’ve   chosen <NAME> <NAME> as my primary tool when trying to use design thinking at my   company . 

 Right now , I ’m working on a Project to develop a new website and app for a shopping   resort . We have many different data sources such as website Analytics , focus groups   results , wifi tracking … some of these sources are quantitative , but others are   qualitative . 

 Mind mapping allows me to find different patterns and insights , and associate them   with different types of customers and visitors of the shopping resort . As a result , I can   create clusters that allow me to develop different marketing strategies having in mind   my customers . 

 Application 

 First of all , I wrote all the different data that we have collected from different   resources into post – its and paper charts . 

 We sticked all these post - its into a wall and ask 10 different people with different   professionals backgrounds to try to cluster all this data so we can find patterns and   insights that will allow us to create personas afterwards . 

 The most enriching part of this proccess has been doing it with not only my team , but   also coworkers from the website & app developing team , designers and also the   marketing team from the shopping resort . 

 As a result , we have now our own “ personas ” , and we are trying to huminize as much   as possible the website and app so we can solve our customers needs and target our   marketing strategies . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Mind mapping , and design thinking in general , has changed the way my company   approachs a new project . 

 Back in the day , when we have to develop a new website we will analyze the data from   Google Analytics in order to know which pages where the most visited and start doing   our prototypes and designs . 

 This was a completely wrong approach , because we forgot to have in mind the most   important thing : customers and visitors . 

 Thanks to mind mapping , I can involve not only my team , but my whole company into   study not only the quantitative data , but also the qualitative . 

 We always try to draw personas and stick them into the wall during our projects , so   when we have to decide something , we can have in mind what our customers will say   about it and What they really need . 

 Mind mapping is now part of our processes , and we are using the learning launch tool   too , so we can test our new products and services as soon as possible and gain   relevant insights that allow us to implement improvements practically on the go .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I was working as an Inventory Analyst in the Logistics Department of a natural gas distribution   company , and together with my boss , we were designing a project that intended to replace our   current inventory management system ( which was based on the use of spreadsheets ) for the   MRP ( Materials Requirement Planning ) module that was included in our SAP ERP system , but   has never been used before . After doing some analysis , we concluded that it would allow us to   enhance our materials requirement planification time and precision . However , we had to   convince our manager about that . 

 Selection 

 In order to efficiently communicate our idea , I selected the Visualization tool ( though in that   time I was not aware of it as a Design Thinking tool ) to convey a clear understanding of the   inventory related problems we would be tackling by implementing the MRP module : reducing   planning time and being able to execute it more often , and reducing the probability of incurring   in a stock - out or an over stock . This would be the best way to get our manager approval . 

 Application 

 Using bar graphs and intuitive pictures ( such as empty shelves or accumulated materials due to   imprecise purchasing ) , through a classic PowerPoint presentation , we presented our project to   the manager . We focused on the current situation ( what is ? ) and the potential situation to which   we would arrive in the event of correctly executing the project ( what if ? ) . 

 Insight 

 Despite the presentation went well , we realized we have n’t fully considered the impact this   project would have in the Procurement Department ( on which our department depended on ) ,   as they workload would have suffered a considerable increase . This was , as I can see now ,   because we were n’t empathetic enough and did n’t consider an important stakeholder the way   we were supposed to . In any case , it was a valuable insight as it helped us significantly in future   projects . 

 Approach 

 The weeks following our presentation , we focused on preparing a learning launch of the module ,   by only using it in a few selected materials , to have a better understanding of the effects it would   have on the whole planning / purchasing process .   Looking back , I think it was n’t a bad idea , but   we probably should ’ve focused even more in the needs of the Procurement Department , as now   I understand it would have saved us a lot of time . As Design Thinking has taught me , the focus   on the user and the stakeholders must be maintained as a main guide during the entire project   management process .

"Learning launch on a critical situation 

 Challenge 

 This few weeks , due to the well - known virus : <NAME> , the Argentinian   National Healthcare Department faced an enormous crisis . People who work in   this area were experiencing the most stressful and overwhelming situation they   had in years . So my team and I needed to find a way to release the pressure   on them quickly , efficiently and effectively . We saw the opportunity to turn an   old and useless room of the healthcare department building into a Pause Place .   A space where employees could relax , take a breath , free their minds and also   have access to a support stuff of psychologists and coaches via video - call . 

 Selection 

 We had the idea , yet we did not know if it would respond to our problem or not .   As time and money were scarce , we decided that the learning launch tool would   be the one that drives us to a suitable solution of the challenge we needed to   solve . The learning launch tool implicates testing and idea iteratively and   improving the prototype on and on , until you get what you are looking for . We   needed to get down to work as soon as possible … so why not testing a learning   launch ! 

 Application 

 We started by preparing the room with scents , pillows , tea bags , snacks ,   among other supplies , and a computer connected with our team members for if   they needed support . 

 After a week , we noticed that few people had entered the room ; so we asked   the healthcare department staff to give us feedback on this new acquisition .   The reason why they were n’t exploiting the Pause Place was that they felt the   onus of   ‘ not being working during work ’ and were not comfortable to leave   their desks . 

 Accordingly , we corrected our missteps and talked to their bosses so that they   encourage employees to take a break and enjoy the new Pause Place . 

 Insights 

 Our team and I , who had never used this prototyping method before , learned a   lot from this situation ! Instead of seeing mistakes as ‘ failure ’ we saw them as   opportunities to improve and learn , and the consequences of this twirl are   huge . We not only avoided frustration when things were n’t going the way we   expected , but also we were more encourage and motivated to enhance the   project . 

 Approach 

 I believe that the learning launch tool best suits this kind of challenges , where   prediction and analysis are not as clear as the experiments . Launching and 

 learning was very effective for us to achieve a compelling solution by trying- and - failing , and upgrading . We still need to analyze the insights of our second   learning launch and see if we are actually getting closer to the solution we are   searching , but it seems to me , based on the outcomes we are getting , that we   actually are !

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I work with an Oil & Gas company in   the Corporate strategy department and responsible for   conceptualizing and implementing digital initiatives across different business units ( Retail , LPG ,   Lubricants , Aviation , I&C , Gas )   across the organization . Currently our team working with our   Retail business unit , which caters to fuels ( Motorspirit , Diesel , CNG ) requirements of customers   through <NAME> and Gas station , to improve customer experience at our fuel stations . 

 We identified 4 - 5 digital initiatives under digital transformation exercise of Retail BU . One of   the initiatives we wanted to implement was <ADDRESS> before fuel options wherein the customer   will pay to our company in advance through online payment options like Netbanking , UPI etc .   We identified 6 key features under this initiatives and confident that the solution will like and   use by customers . However , basis my learning from this course , I suggested to test the key   assumptions and test the different elements of the solution before investing into the   technology . 

 Selection    As there were multiple key elements of Prepayment solution , it was important to test the   customer desirability and key assumptions before developing the full solutions .   We selected   “ Learning Launch Tool ” as it is important to conduct small experiments and test our idea and   prototype before designing the final solution . 

 Application    For our first learning launch , we decided to do “ Concept testing ” with 6 identified key elements   under prepayment solution to assess desirability of solution with customers . We use card   categorization and sorting methodology to understand customer desirability ( and the reason )   for each 6 identified key features . We identified 20 people across 3 segments ( segment cuts are   basis age groups , genders & fueling behaviors ) and interviewed them for concept testing .      Basis positive customer feedback during concept testing , we decided to do second learning   launch by conducting “ functional prototype testing ” with our customers at fuel stations . We   identified 2 fuel stations in two different geography ( one in urban city and one in rural area ) to   test the solution with customers . We designed to conduct 3 days functional prototype testing in   each location covering all 6 identified key features . We developed a small application to test   the prototype and tested with 300 customers in each location capturing their feedback . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning launch tool , our team tested the desirability of key features with   customers along with key assumptions . Although , we   thought that all the 6 key features of the   Prepayment solutions was liked by the users , after completing functional prototype testing , the   actual results reveal that 4 out of 6 features liked by users . Also , the key assumption   was that   customers are comfortable in doing Prepayment for fuel before coming to the fuel stations , but   prototype testing revealed that customers are much more comfortable to Prepay for fuel at the   fuel stations than prepay before visiting the fuel stations .   The insights were shared with Retail   BU and the team is incorporating the insights for final product design . 

 Approach 

 After seeing the result from our functional prototype testing and value of “ Learning Launch   Tool ” , our team has decided to use the “ Learning Launch Tool ” in our digital initiatives to test   the customer desirability and key assumptions and incorporate the insights into final product   design . Our team has realized the importance of doing quick prototyping and testing the   customer desirability and key assumption before implementing the final solution .

"MIND MAPPING APPLIED TO RISING THE BAR IN MAN OPS 

 Challenge 

 At the company I work for , we are transforming . Following a change of board and a pandemic ,   our strategy has shifted towards an energizing and hopeful vision based on net zero emissions   in production process and products . However , maintaining operational rigor , calm and not being   carried away by uncertainty and unease can be a challenge . 

 The pandemic has deprived us of our escapes , of our social relationships , and the number of   supervisors in the plant has also decreased . The transformation of the company implies a   reduction in personnel and a reconfiguration of hierarchy and ways of working . Simultaneously ,   the number of civil and construction works in the refinery increases to adapt to a new scenario   of more sustainable production . 

 More jobs in the plant , fewer supervisors , and a climate of uncertainty = more risk of unwanted   events . 

 Fact : The number of potential incidents at other refineries has increased . Our internal   verifications show an upward trend in the number of "" minor errors "" . 

 Challenge : to rise commitment and proactivity standards withing the first line workforce . As a   result , fewer incidents are expected . 

 Questions : What can we do to increase the level of care ? How can we prevent the number of   incidents from increasing in our refinery , and with it the risk of suffering an accident ? What is in   our power to provide peace of mind in an uncertain time to mitigate the human factor in errors ? 

 Selection 

 This is not an easy problem to solve since it involves many soft skills the engineers and operators   who work in the plant are not very used to . The project was assigned to a colleague and me , but   we believe that it is worth expanding the spectrum of opinion , at least , to the entire XLT of   Operations to broaden perspectives and fully understand the problem and the underlying causes 

 I think the problem is abstract enough to use a tool that helps us define some basic criteria to   move to the next stage . That is why I have chosen mind - mapping . Mind - mapping is a technique   typically used to explore data and find patterns and perspectives that lead to insights and more   creative solutions . 

 I´m sure it would provide a good basis for us to understand underlying issues , putting ourselves   in the shoes of operators ’ collective and to move from "" what is "" to "" what if "" . 

 Application 

 Due to the pandemic , we are unable to meet face - to - face in a room to see all the data first - hand .   I therefore organized a virtual session and previously sent the following documentation : 

 - Analysis of recent high potential incidents of other refineries of the group 

 - Analysis of internal incidents 

 - KPIs for compliance with our operational excellence parameters 

 - Results of the last employee satisfaction survey ( shifts ) 

 - Analysis of the results of the survey / interviews carried out by the WANT team of the UJI   ( Positive Organizational Psychology ) based on their Health and Resilient Organizations standards 

 As I said , I summoned the entire <ADDRESS> after telling them that we needed their collaboration to   promote a change in mindset ; we are 14 people . I started the meeting by sharing screen and   sequentially showed all the documents that I mentioned above and that I sent as pre - read or   significant data for the meeting . I wanted to spend time displaying all the data in case someone   had n't been able to see it in full . 

 Next , we shared a panel of the <NAME> application and I asked each one of them to put , in   different notes and individually , the learnings they had obtained from the visualization of the   information provided , without previously commenting on it with anyone . Then we gave   ourselves 10 minutes to read all the notes and think about how they could be clustered . It took   us about 40 minutes to perform this step , which was somewhat chaotic in <NAME> because   there were many people without being able to see each other ’s expression when sharing a   screen . Maybe it would have been better to set shifts . 

 Finally , we were able to summarize in 1 or 2 sentences the fundamental ideas of each cluster   and we took a break before proceeding to interconnect them . The part of interconnection and   specification of the criteria of the process took us around 1.5 hours , where I acted as a coach   asking questions like : and what does that translate into ? Why do we think that happens ? What   does this affect to ? ... 

 Insight 

 The fundamental insights of our process were that we had a very pyramidal structure that left   little room for the operators to take the initiative . We must delegate part of the control to create   a structure of acquisition of individual leadership , responsibility , and proactivity . This is also   related to the factors that fared worst in employee satisfaction surveys . However , to give up   control , we must work on tools so that they can assume it . 

 -   The first is to create competence ( improving training processes , training exercises ,   participation in creating procedures ... ) 

 -   The second is clarity in our direction ( set the main goal for the semester / year and put   it in writing in the control room , repeat the message , quarterly review of progress   towards our objective , etc . ) 

 Mind - mapping has seemed like an excellent technique to land soft and abstract targets in   tangible actions . 

 Approach 

 I would use the same tool next time , however , I will take care of reserving the auditorium   room ( with capacity for many people ) to be able to do the exercise in person safely with the   sanitary measures that apply , since the <NAME> alternative reduces fluidity and hinders   the dynamics .

"Example Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I am was a master ’s degree student doing a master ’s thesis at one of the aircraft manufacturers , and the   challenge was to come up with a new design for an AGV ( Automated Guided Vehicle ) which is a pre - programed   robotic vehicle used for automation , and in this case to be used in the internal transport of goods . The   stakeholders wanted an AGV that can pick up and transfer large industrial wagons without having to change the   design of the wagons themselves , which the current market AGVs ca n’t handle . The challenge was to design an   AGV that can safely lift the wagons , which of course will be loaded with tools , and transfer it from point A to B   without risking falling anything during the whole process . 

 Selection 

 Within the design team we selected the visualization design tool , as it was an engineering design that   will result in a final product , and to allow each member in the design team to demonstrate his idea , it   was really important for other members to use imagination , and what is better to see others ’ ideas   than visualization ? ! 

 Application 

 The design team started by each one sketching his design on a piece of paper , then we collected all   designs and pinned them on the wall , then we discussed each design individually finding out the   advantages and disadvantages for each design , then we started to combine some features , and came   up at the end with five proposal designs as you can see in the following pictures , to present and discuss   them with the stakeholders . 

 Next , we presented the five designs to the stakeholders to discuss what is best for the project and to   gain more insight from their point of view , which was helpful and added more ideas to the final   product and improved its performance . 

 Insight 

 By applying the visualization tool the whole team and the stakeholders were able to easily deliver their   suggested design . Moreover , other team members were able to gain more design flexibility when they   explored each other ’s designs , which in the end resulted in the final implemented design which was   successful and gained the stakeholders ’ satisfaction . 

 Approach 

 After the project , I realized that it ’s much better to include videos and animations to better deliver all   the ideas to the stakeholders rather than just pictures , especially with designs that include engineering   products performing a task . With pictures , you can deliver the initial design and leave the stakeholder   to imagine the process . However , with videos and animations , the stakeholder can imagine the whole   process and can also add deeper insight and suggestions related to the operation .

"Tool chosen – Mind - mapping 

 Challenge 

 As a designer , I often work on projects that require a lot of systems design planning .   Systems design includes studying a current system ( e.g. , Public transportation in a country ) ,   understanding the current scenario , existing problems and issues within the system , and   coming up with appropriate solutions to tackle problems . Recently , I worked on Public   transportation in <ADDRESS> . My idea was to first understand the current scenario , understand   implemented solutions , understand why a lot of the solutions do n’t work in a country like   ours , and then go on to finding suitable solutions to overcome existing problems . 

 Selection 

 I took up mind - mapping as a tool because it brings to light various problems that we would   often overlook . Mind - mapping looks for patterns and themes in existing data , and helps   highlight relevant information . 

 Application 

 For the first phase of the systems design , I first brainstormed on the various issues   pertaining public transportation in <ADDRESS> , today . A lot of problems came to light , including   overcrowding , lack of maintenance , lack of proper infrastructural development , and so on .   Applying the mind map tool helped understand and correlate a lot of these problems . For   example , I realised that by tackling an issue like overcrowding , we can cut down on   maintenance costs as it results in lesser property damage and property misuse like torn   seats , strewn garbage , etc . 

 A lot of problems were inter - linked with one another . Mind - mapping helped link as well as   understand how to go about the problem - solving stage because it changed my approach to   a lot of these issues and perspective on how to implement appropriate solutions . 

 Mind - mapping at the second phase also proved to be fruitful as it helped narrow down   important issues ( issues that are of utmost importance and need to be dealt with right away )   that can be dealt with an array of smartly - devised solutions . Mind - mapping helped realise   that overcrowding was one of the main issues that required immediate attention due to   safety issues as well as maintenance and bus up - keep ’s sake . 

 Insight 

 What I have learnt from this is that even a simple tool like mind - mapping can help dig deeper   into issues and highlight information . Even by just putting up all problems on the same   platform , the correlating and inter - linking of problems shed light on newer and more   innovative ways to approach a system issue this broad . This has since changed my   perspective about how important design thinking tools like mind - mapping is because it helps   understand the underlying issues in a deeper manner and also helps understand how a lot   of problems are inter - linked and can be solved in a much more efficient way . 

 Approach 

 Ever since realising the true potential of design thinking tools like mind - mapping , my   approach to solving problems has changed . I am a lot more efficient and tend to look at   problems on a broader platform . Mind - mapping has helped broaden and correlate issues in   a way that are smarter to provide solutions for .

"Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information .

 <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> ’s public transport has historic problems and is not seen as integrative due to various political   ( and other ) constraints such as national ownership of the highway and metrorail service , and municipal   ownership of the new bus rapid transports system ( MyCiti Bus ) as well as private ownership of informal   taxi services uses minibus taxis , other taxi services such as Uber and metred taxis , as well as private   ownership of the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> development area . 

 <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> is largely designed for people using private motor vehicles or the MyCiti Bus . It is not   pedestrian friendly , and there are numerous risks posed to the pedestrians as well as general   unpleasantries such as cold and wet winter walks through unsheltered routes .   However , many people   who work in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> can not afford to own their own cars and have to travel by bus , train and taxi . 

 Our challenge was to identify the problems associated with being a pedestrian in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> and   provide some possible solutions to the private developer to make the space safer and better for   commuters . 

 Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. what it is and why you   selected it for your challenge - including any appropriate video lecture references ) 

 As the business park area is privately owned , the developer prioritises businesses that are commercially   viable . It listens to the voices of the companies where it sees an opportunity for profit . The people using   the public transport systems ( as opposed to private vehicles ) however usually have the ‘ smaller voices ’   and occupy the service positions in many of these companies ( e.g. cleaner , cook , administrative   services ) . 

 <NAME> telling was therefore chosen as the tool to investigate these problems as it can build empathy for   the user , and has the potential to connect with the developer . In order to gather enough information to   build a story to tell , we used complementary design tools such as interviewing , observing , and journey   mapping ( also considered as visualisation ) . These tools resulted in a story that not only helped us   understand the problem better , it also provided a cause . 

 The final product included a well - researched timeline of a number of commuters with different   backgrounds , and illustrated that with a few new designs to direct the flow of pedestrians , the area could   attract more people to the business park . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. what you did and   how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) 

 To prepare for the practical aspect of our challenge , we identified key points where we would get diverse   groups of commuters using public transport . In pairs , a group of 18 people went out to these areas and   spent 45 minutes observing the area . We then spent another 45 minutes interviewing commuters ,   asking open - ended questions about their journey . Once this short time had been spent trying to   understand the commuters common problems , each pair selected a persona - someone typical that we   had encountered on our excursion . Personas assume the attributes of the groups they represent from   their social , demographic and cultural characteristics , to their wants and needs , and habits etc . 

 We proceeded to use journey mapping to unpack these lives and imagine the actions of a typical ‘ day   in the life of . ’ 

 Journey mapping is a useful tool to illustrate a sequence of events and created a powerful message   with multiple moments of reflection . It requires the following steps to be taken : 

 1 . Identify the timeline over which the journey will be mapped ( e.g. a day in the life of ) 

 2 . Mark the steps over the journey ( e.g. leave the house , get to train station , take train … . ) 

 3 . Identify the activities associated with those steps ( 2 ) ( e.g. walking , buying ticket ... ) 

 4 . Describe the thoughts/ feelings associated with each of the activities 

 5 . Identify the interactions that the user may have ( e.g. the pavement , road traffic , the ticket sales 

 person … ) 

 6 . Associate the interactions and activities with a feeling of good or bad , or a pain and gain map . 

 By breaking down the journey into steps , actions and feelings towards those touch points , it is possible   to understand the user ’s frustrations and exact points where you can improve the journey . This gives   points where problems can be solved . 

 Using these steps enabled us to choose five personas to build further into a written story . With the   research that we had done , we were able to compose a well thought out piece on each persona . 

 Insight : describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g.   how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about deign thinking more broadly ) 

 The combined efforts of observation , interviewing and journey mapping contributed to creating a story   that could be shared with the developer of the business park . The stories of five iconic people who   struggle with their daily commute demonstrated that something needs to change . Because they were   representative of people we have daily associations with , it made the problem relatable . 

 Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time = applying the same tool you selected or   a different one – and the reasons why 

 Journey mapping was a useful tool to build empathy for the user of a system and would therefore use   it again . However , as this exercise was primarily a training exercise , the obvious way to improve the   process would be to spend more time observing and interviewing people to get a better diversity of   users to understand . Furthermore , a key process in sharing the story more effectively would ’ve been to   invite the developer to join us through the design process .

"<NAME> <NAME> is a powerful note - taking method . <NAME> <NAME> not only highlight important facts ,   but also show the overall structure of a subject and the relative importance of individual parts of   it . They are great when you need to think creatively , and can help you to make new connections   between ideas . 

 A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information . ... Mind maps can also be   drawn by hand , either as "" notes "" during a lecture , meeting or planning session , for example , or   as higher quality pictures when more time is available . 

 Mind mapping is an effective tool for taking notes and for better understanding and learning   information . You can use it while studying or you can incorporate it into your professional   career . In general , mind mapping is a good alternative way of accumulating knowledge   regardless of the area you use it in . 

 A lot of people think that , because there is drawing involved in a mind map , they take   more time to create than your standard linear notes . The truth is , you can spend hours   perfecting your mind map to turn it into a piece of art , if that 's what you want to do .

"Example Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In order to improve sales , and thus the relationship of a company with its customers , it was decided to   somehow measure customer satisfaction using the NPS methodology , and thus be able to identify   possible drawbacks in the processes to be improved , as well as carry out quick and concrete actions with   detractor customers . We use the mind mapping tool to decide the actions to be carried out . 

 Application 

 We start with a small audience of promoter , neutral and detractor clients . What was done was first a   training for employees , in terms of customer service . A speech was prepared and the first calls were   made . At this point the mission was to listen and record everything that the client said . 

 After this , the comments were grouped into suggestions , annoyances , or compliments . In this phase , we   held a workshop in which several collaborators from various areas participated to brainstorm ideas ,   focused on the inconvenience of customers . The collaboration of the different areas seemed important   to us , to have various visions of actions . 

 Some annoyances made reference to some bureaucratic and slow processes that the company had in   terms of issuing its products . On the other hand , others spoke of a lack of knowledge of the client to   offer some products . 

 Thanks to these comments and this study , it was possible to carry out timely actions and offers directed   to our clients . As well as the improvement of some processes that slowed the attention . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This workshop resulted in several improvement actions and we realized that the most important thing in   a company is to know and listen above all to the customer in order to make quick decisions and take   timely actions . 

 After this sample , it was extended to all clients and thus interdisciplinary working groups were made to   carry out the necessary actions . This also helped us to work better as a team and think about corporate   well - being in a unanimous way , breaking down the barriers between areas .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I am part of a team which works on a product that captures metrics of all projects initiated in a   service based company and based on the metrics , the application provides insights into project   performance , areas of concern , achievements , etc . The data is submitted once in a month for   an entire month and then it is followed by a review , post which the same data shall be shared   with the organization leadership for further review / analysis and action if required . 

 We noticed that the data at the time of review by the leadership would be almost as old as 1.5   to 2 months . We wanted to cut down on this delay and make the data submission cycle weekly .   In doing this we had to consider the various categories of projects and their data capture   templates . This meant the expected change was complex and had to go through a lot of   planning , impact analysis and mitigation plans in case of issues . 

 To deal with this chose <NAME> <NAME> as our design tool , as we could learn better in a   working environment with a fewer projects . <NAME> <NAME> help us to test an idea quickly   with lesser cost . At the end of a learning launch , we should be able to arrive at a decision   whether to go ahead with the idea or not . 

 Application 

 For the learning launch , we selected only one category of project . We developed a weekly   system , and the selected a handful of projects for the launch . The project leaders were trained   on the system and were asked to submit their data on this new system . During the process , I   noted all the pain points and they were addressed . We did this for a couple of weekly cycles to   test the outcome of this process change . 

 Leadership at organization level were also consulted to understand if there were any   suggestions / concerns . The reviews were made available anytime as opposed to previous ‘ once   in a month ’ process . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 Throughout the learning launch , the key was to stay connected with the application users to   gather their feedback , identify areas of improvement , in general to understand what works best   for both parties . I held multiple demos / live working sessions , feedback sessions after the launch   in order to make this transition easy for the users . The data captured were analyzed   thoroughly , and appropriate enhancements were done on the data review application . 

 During the learning launch , we got an opportunity to understand various problem statements .   We were able to come up with a better solutions to these problems . With the knowledge   gained during learning launch , we were able to make the transition for other project types with   much ease . 

 This whole process has given so much of learning that I have realized for complex changes   where the investment in time and money is higher , <NAME> <NAME> is the best way to quickly   test the approach / idea for the outcome . 

 I must admit , that the organization leadership are now able to view nearly real time data at any   given point of time and are able to intervene in cases where they foresee an issue .

"Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information .     Enterprise and corporate mobile apps are in high demand . Since I am part of our organization ’s 

 internal mobile app development team , I and our team were given a challenge to create one 

 all - in - one mobile app for employees . The mobile app solution should have all the important 

 features an employee would use frequently and also have a communication channel for 

 organization news , emergency broadcasts etc . The project scope included top 15 features used 

 by employees , as identified from the company web portal . Stakeholders and users included the 

 entire organization , along with the senior management buy - in . The project timeline was two 

 months . We planned to focus on a mobile app solution by connecting with different stakeholders 

 - from bottom to top - to uncover both the functional and technical requirements .     Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is and 

 why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture 

 references ) .     Since we were more focused on understanding requirements of a large user base , distributed 

 across many personas , we focused on mind mapping . We did not select visualization since we 

 did not want to be constrained by technology limitations which could have come up due to a 

 particular chosen UI or visual interpretation . Mind mapping gave us an opportunity to aim for a 

 more interconnected and modular mobile solution .     Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , what 

 you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) .     We divided the entire project of two months ( i.e. eight weeks ) into three workshops of two weeks 

 each , with the last two weeks for internal assessment and documentation .     First we connected with different potential users to discover with a ‘ what if ? ’ mindset . We 

 engaged 12 - 14 different users , with four personas , in coffee sessions , Q&As , whiteboard - all to 

 create free - flowing mind maps . This tested our assumption of mobile app architecture and end 

 user use cases . In this phase , we focused a lot on feelings and empathy .     Next , we connected with the management and corporate communications team to understand 

 perspective . We did this through formal meetings with digital tools for mind mapping . We asked 

 them what would they like the user to do when a particular news / broadcast is sent . This helped 

 us negate ( and in few cases , affirm ) our assumptions about what is expected from the solution .     Further , we connected with the technical team for mind mapping of different components . 

 Though this might sound counter - intuitive , it was critical to understand what we could do and 

 what we could not . We could create mind mappings of technical interactions and their 

 implications on the end solution .     At the end , during the last two weeks , we documented all the three mind mapping collections . 

 Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your 

 challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about 

 design thinking more broadly ) .     With the help of mind mapping exercise , we discovered a lot about our users and stakeholders . 

 We discovered that rather than a very smart do - it - all mobile app , they want something ‘ simple ’ 

 and personalized . Further , our assumptions on how users would use this app were broken .     Though before the exercise , we were thinking that we should target all the devices and form 

 factors , after the exercise we got the data and the insight to stick to 4 - 5 most popular ones only .     Another critical insight was from a technical implementation standpoint . We discovered that we 

 do not need to train our team on a technology we had assumed will be used in the solution . 

 Instead existing competencies could very well be used for the development of the solution .     Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you 

 selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why     Since this was a new product to be created , we were able to successfully use the mind mapping 

 approach to design thinking in the creation of this solution . Next time , since the solution is 

 already in place , and will need modifications , we will use the visualization approach . It will help 

 us and all stakeholders better understand what changes we are looking to make in the solution .

"Storytelling     Challenge      I presently work as a Design consultant in an Indian based IT services organisation .As a part of the presales / bidding team   pitching for design , development , testing   services to different clients across the globe provides a complex problem for us since   the audience from the client side vary from marketing , technology , sales etc , majority of them might be more interested in the   numbers like cost , time , resources etc   and technical architecture aspects of what we offer . The experience domain is   something which many organisations are still opening upto but many are still unaware of the need and impact it can create .     The asks sometimes miss out on the experience front , though found to be an essential component for the success of the   outcome , based on initial research by us . To approach those proposals is a challenge as scope of the project would need to be   tweaked by the client needing a solid basis or reason .     A universal method of starting the discussion in terms of providing a vision for the client to start and later branching the   discussion into the various domains is needed .      An opportunity was presented when we were responding   for a proposal for a multinational consumer goods company , the ask   was to unify their laundry services ’ online presence , presently in the form of 3 different websites for their dry cleaning , self   service locker and campus laundry services , also present was a mobile application limited to tracking the clothes . The basic   need was to shift to a unified online presence . The ask was direct – to create one website from the three .        Selection     The main concern was   that that the client was not aware of the complexity of creating one unifying presence from present 3   different sites having different users , their journeys and expectations .Simple scope mentioned creation of the web based site   and extension of services onto their present mobile application . The requirement did not cater the present trends    of mobile dependency and need of a seamless experience by all the clients ’ target users . This aspect needed to be   communicated to the client effectively .       I decided to use story telling as a tool to create the right impact for conveying what our vision was for the brands ’ unified portal .   <NAME> would also help in explaining the client to look into the ecosystem creation for their users ( like providing cross sell   and <NAME> opportunities later on ) , which seemed to have been overlooked in their requirement . Also last but not least since the   outcome was to be a B2C ( Business to customer ) experience , the need was for extending the brand story more strongly to   make the connect with their customers . Story telling would be an apt tool for the above .       Application     I needed the story to relate to the reviewers ( audience ) from the client side . So the story line that I created was from the point of   view of a campus student , not only because the student was also a user of clients ’ services but also because they will have the   empathy towards them based on their similar past journey ( almost all of them must have been a student at some point of time )     Another reason of choosing the campus student was that the he / she might be more willing to avail other services offered by   client more openly . A character called <NAME> was chosen as the main character of the story where she joins as a freshman in   college . The premise was also created for her journey into college . <NAME> ’s life in a day was the main storyline on which the   pain points were concentrated upon , for example : juggling of time between classes , preparation required before laundry , stress   she goes through thinking about the same etc . This way the main challenges were highlighted . The story was told using   storyboarding and imagery and the presentation was done through video conference .     The main issues were highlighted post the story telling which were : availability of laundry options according to convenience ,   assistance required in preparation , planning of the laundry cycles etc . A solution view was presented as the happy state also in   a story form . The case was also presented that the student in the future will become a different segment user and since the   connection is made he / she might become brand loyal and continue the journey through other services . A strong   business case   of upsell / cross sell was also communicated throughout the story . I was able to highlight a major point of strategic change that   was required by the client in terms of strategy , which   was to concentrate on the   mobile presence approach rather than the   present ask of web .      So the story was built from a premise to the present and finally to a future scenario and steps of how to reach that state .       Insight     The presentation was well received from the client , they agreed to most of the scope modifications suggested . Few which they   mentioned that could not be implemented were reserved for the future scope of work . Overall it was a good and apt case of   using story telling to push through our strategic vision and win the project .     Storytelling as a tool is very effective but does have its limitations .Its very effective for the cases where the brand story has to   be enhanced , created or relooked into . Cases where the strategic changes are to be suggested the method of story telling also   works . But it is difficult to use story telling for creating use cases or business cases when the scope of something is already well   defined or clarity of approach is very much present , examples of them would be B2B ( business to business applications ) . 

 Approach     The approach followed by me for the above scenario was suited and worked perfectly , but as I face different clients with   different requirements this process might not give the same results like others .     As mentioned above that story telling would be helpful in cases where the brand value and user centric design plays a major   part but many a times I or we face clients from the B2B domain where the asks are not that oriented to the above points .   I would in that scenario   try to use a combination of storytelling with the refined process / service flow solutions .

"Example Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge and Selection Storytelling is a great tool that I use all the time . However , a wonderful   teacher taught me how to use storytelling , thereby turning my design   thinking upside down . I am studying to be a designer at the university .   In the new academic year , I have a new subject – animation . It was very   interesting for me to try drawing cartoons , but at the same time I was   afraid to do it and did not know where to start . To help me come up with   the story I want to show in animation , my teacher started telling stories   from her experience , and she shared stories from her life to help me use   them in the context of my story . As I understand now , she did this in   order for me to understand my interests and determine my goal - what I   want to talk about in the cartoon . 

 Application Visualization and other ways of design thinking did n’t work for me . They   only made me feel anxious and uncomfortable . At first I tried to come up   with an incredible story about a dolphin , but the pictures popping up in   my head told me that I could not cope . Then I decided to write the story   that comes from the heart . This unconscious story later became a huge   project that won first place in the student cartoon competition . 

 <NAME> <NAME> achieved such success , I realized that design thinking is impor- tant not only for study and work , but also for life in general . Storytelling   helps you take a personal approach , come up with a good story , and re- duce anxiety . Storytelling is the first stage in work , so there is no need   to run ahead and be afraid , you need to do it now , and in the future   everything will turn out as it should . 

 Approach I think the next time I run into a similar problem , I ’ll try combining sto- rytelling and visualization to try and achieve better results . 

"
"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 Communicating effectively through drawing is not as simple as selecting the right approach . Learning   how to see two - dimensional and three - dimensional information , understanding its complexities , and   interpreting from varied points of view is necessary . This is a challenge for me in design and   engineering who has varied but shallow visual experiences . I can range from being quite insensitive   to the physical world around me to having specific but narrow experiences . 

 Selection 

 Creating a research wall is a great way to display insights , photos , and artifacts – all the relevant   research outputs in one place . This approach helps me build connections between different findings   and understand the bigger picture . The visual aspect of the wall triggers idea generation and enables   project members to better understand research insights . For this reason , design thinkers often use   tools such as persona which give a face to the customer / interviewee . 

 Visual tools that can be used for understanding the problem are for e.g. personas , mind maps ,   customer journey maps . 

 Application 

 In the same way that sketching helps the designer to think and elaborate ideas , early prototyping is   another way of visualizing and testing new solutions , it is a visual manifestation of concepts , the   transformation of an idea in a testable model . In another word , the use of prototyping transforms   ideas from drawings on paper to tangible solutions . Visual tools that can be used for prototyping are   for e.g. , desktop walkthrough , cardboard prototyping , paper prototyping , role - playing . 

 Insight 

 The drawing for designers is a way to express their ideas and only drawing simultaneously reveals   both the functional characteristics of an idea and its emotional content . It is not necessary to poses   good drawing skills – as the popular saying goes “ a picture is worth a thousand words ” and even a   simple sketch can tell us more than a 10 - minute description of an idea . In a group setting ,   visualization helps to spark idea generation . Seeing what other people are drawing , adding elements   to their drawing , or simply discussing the sketches helps to build on top of each other ’s ideas .   Brainstorming sessions can be also enhanced using visual props such as nudge cards to stimulate   idea creation . 

 Approach 

 When used , this approach offers a rapid means for developing structured forms that are accurate in   proportion , perspective yet can be sufficiently flexible . By placing and securing tracing paper over   the grid , I can shape information into coherent statements of intent and effectively modify their   thinking ( design ) to create better proposals .

"Challenge and Selection 

 My challenge was to design an optimal processing station for a new chamber , which needs to be capable   of running many different applications .   The different application have different requirements and   emphasize different aspects of performance differently .   This means that certain characteristics of the   station , for example flow and temperature characteristics , are more important for certain applications   than others .   In some cases those requirements are conflicting or inversely related , so it involves making   tradeoffs .   My goal was to create the minimum number of configurations of process stations to satisfy   the various requirements .   Initially a lot of analysis was done , which generated various numerical values   and individual graphs .   After compiling much of this data I decided that more visualization would be the   best tool to use , because it can graphically assist in mapping the requirements , outputs , and capabilities ,   while highlighting gaps .   It not only easier for me to see , but it also made it easier to explain to others . 

 Application 

 I used visualization by creating a 3D map of three of the most important characteristics and mapping   where the different designs sit in the three dimensional space of those requirements .   In addition I   mapped the expected requirements of prospective application into the same space , which allowed   everyone to see where the designs match up and where there are gaps . 

 Insight 

 I learned a new tool for clearly showing requirements and design tradeoffs when the number of   dimensions is low enough .   In this case it was possible to simplify down to the three most important   characteristics .   It showed me where I needed to focus my design efforts and where an optimal solution   might be found , with this solution being the best combination of performance in different areas . 

 Approach 

 I learned that this technique can be used earlier in the process to guide design before significant design   activity has been undertaken .   It could be used to see from the beginning whether there is an optimal   design for all known applications or if multiple designs are needed .   My current use of the tool showed   later in the process where there gaps based on the designs that were already done .   It could be done   more efficiently if the tool is used earlier .

 ● People   wear   comfortable   “ inside   shoes ”   when   at   home .    ( in   many   cultures ,   especially    in   our   primary   market   in   ASEAN ,   outside   shoes   stay   outside   of   the   door ) 

 ● Comfort   is   key   decision   factor   in   buying   footwear 

 ● People   are   looking   for   outlets   for   self - expression   like   fashion 

 As   TMC   is   going   with   prototypes ,   the   best   learning   launch   will   be   testing   two   slipper    styles   for   both   men   and   women ,   each   style   in   a   different   textile ,   with   real   customers .    Slippers   can   quickly   be   Made   to   Order   to   fulfill   customer   orders   in   order   to   keep   this   a   cheap    experiment . 

 We   will   launch   on   both   our   single   brand   and   on   a   multi - brand   web   store   ( holalili.com   and    stridecollectiveph.com ) .    A   product   page   will   be   created   on   both   websites   with   photos   of    prototypes   and   full   product   details   and   a   preliminary   price   based   on   product   cost   estimates .    The   slipper   “ launch ”   will   be   supported   with   social   media   for   up   to   4   weeks   to   get   the   word   out    and   drive   customer   traffic   to   the   new   product   pages .    With   online   channels   we   can   quickly    change   colors   and   price   points   and   measure   stickiness   and   purchases .    We   will   stick   to   the    <ADDRESS>   market   so   orders   can   be   quickly   manufactured   and   fulfilled .      Data   to   be   measured   will   include   sales   volume   versus   2019 ,   mix   between   men   and   women ’s    shoes   sold ,   and   ranking   of   visits   and   sales   of   new   slippers   on   multi   brand   store .    Frankly ,    sales   have   been   zero   for   March   and   April ,   so   any   momentum   is   positive   if   we   can   sell   at    gross   profit   of   40 % .    ( Financial   wow   should   be   easy   as   we   can   locally   source   materials   and    wo n’t   need   leather . )       If   the   first   Learning   Launch   is   successful ,   we   want   to   test   coordinated   outdoor   and   indoor    shoes .    Using   the   same   handwoven   textile ,   we   can   bundle   sneakers ,   slippers ,   and   mask ,    featuring   the   same   textile .    ( Shoe   factory   is   currently   making   PPE   and   masks   to   keep    shoemakers   earning ) .     We ’ve   seen   masks   coordinating   with   shoes   and   bags   with   existing    customers ,   and   would   like   to   add   bundled   offerings / cross   selling   to   see   if   there   is   any    opportunity   here .     Sneakers   have   been   a   strong   product   for   TMC ,   growing   into   younger    markets ,   and   increasing   sales   to   men .      Approach      E   Commerce   is   a   great   channel   for   a   Learning   Launch   as   it   is   quick ,   cheap ,   and   extensive    analytics   are   available   to   track   customer ’s   online   behavior .    Frankly ,   with   C19 ,   face   to   face   or    in - person   observations   are n’t   available   in   this   market   beyond   industry   data ,   and    observations   in   supermarkets   and   other   open   public   spaces .       While   the   learning   launch   will   be   focused   on   testing   the   saleability   new   product   as   a   proxy    for   customer   need ,   if   it   does n’t   sell ,   we   can   look   at   customer   behavior   data   in   Google    Analytics ,   especially   on   the   multi   brand   site ,   to   see   what   shoes   customers   coming   to   the    “ inside   shoe ”   page ,   look   at   or   go   on   to   buy .    Do   customers   interested   in   the   slippers   behave    differently ?    Does   the   slipper   social   media   pull   in   less / more   traffic   than   sneakers   or   mules ?    Does   the   gender   mix   change   with   slippers   vs   other   shoes ?       We   can   also   test   in - store   with   prototypes   to   get   first   person   feedback   on   customer   needs ,    product   design ,   pricing ,   and   how   they   view   footwear   today   versus   a   few   months   ago .   Traffic    is   much   lower   and   will   have   to   be   done   by   shop   girl .      Ethnographic   research   could   add   more   valuable   insight   into   customer ’s   new   use   of   footwear    and   would   be   a   far   better   to   start   the   design   innovation   process .    However ,   the   cost   and    logistics   make   it   difficult .    With   the   learning   launch ,   we   are   giving   small   amounts   of   work   to    our   artisan   livelihoods ,   and   learning   if   there   is   a   larger   business   there .

"Challenges 

 The first tool I used was the tool of visualization , or visual Thinking , in project of inspirational   garden in <ADDRESS> to shape better understanding of different gardens design . I used this idea to   educate people about the beauty of these masterpiece . The inspirational garden in <ADDRESS> book   targets <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> and western countries . In addition to the techniques that been used are   Photoshop , Power point , Blurb program and <NAME> for taking photos . Also we discussed the   project idea between all members of the group . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 First , we started to make brain storming for the ideas to choose the best . Also we choose the   materials and programs that will be used in the project . Moreover we discussed the schedule   and the progress of working . Second , the searching and visiting different grands to take the   photo was the most entertaining part . While designing and arranging the information was the   most difficult part in the project . In the end we make a survey and give it to group of student to   evaluate the final look of the book . 

 Application 

 The book was created like a coffee table book .Which designed to display on a table intended   for use in an area in which one entertains guests and which it can serve to inspire conversation   or pass the time . We used blurb website to create the book format , design and the   arrangement of photos and the information . We used professional camera to take good quality   of pictures . 

 Insight 

 The part of designing and arrangement of the book was the most challenging part . Because we   have to discuss each section and draw the design before Appling it . The same goes with visiting   the gardens and taking the photos . The main thing that been focused on how to deliver and   show the idea to the people . 

 Approach 

 I learned many thing from this project . The most important thing working on team and how to   discuss and share the ideas with others.in addition how to solve technical things that happen   with designing program . Also using pictures and visuals is the best and easy way to deliver the   idea for public .

"Reflection – Visualization & Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection     Visualization and Storytelling is a tool that I used to use all the time in my head actually , instead of   implementing it in my surrounding world out there until I was able to recognize its true importance after   learning from the examples in this course .   I was doing an internship , and as an intern there , I have observed some of my colleagues I worked with   were vulnerable , besides they were so capable , skilled and talented but were unsuccessful in showing that   side of themselves to others , thus they were always excluded from taking into consideration due to   inequity . Many of these people deal with oppression , injustice , and insults , they actually need   empowerment and inspiration to move on and highlight themselves and benefit with what they can   contribute actually . I honestly believe spending time in “ opening people up ” and finding ways to inspire   them to improve their circumstances wherever they are . I share stories of my life and let them visualize it   in order to help them visualize a state of independence , I use their response to my story to ascertain their   goals , and sometimes to use stories to better understand their interests and thought processes . I use this   information to develop different strategies to try and find a way that works for them to gain more freedom   in the areas they find themselves lacking in their lives . So I picked 2 fellow colleagues of mine ( obviously   picked or selected them in my mind without them knowing ) . 

 Application     I have a story about using storytelling and visualization in order to achieve success that is directly   proportional to the success of others .   I have begun with a small initiative or step . I let my   colleague / teammate visualize a state of independence after I told her my story , that to survive in the   inequity and environment where you feel excluded , you have to keep doing your best , so that your work   speaks for itself even if they do n’t take you into consideration let your work do the justice . 

 I was in the evaluation session with panel including the managing director , team leads and managers ,   where I gathered the courage to tell them the story and help them visualize with the help of visuals on the   white board where I explained the story by taking an example and that example is relating to the situation   I was thinking to solve . I tried explaining them the benefits to the organization after using the   “ EMPLOYEE - FOCUSED - APPROACH ” . Such approach in a workplace is one in which all individuals ,   programs , processes , and systems are focused on helping employees become fully successful .   Individuals who feel valued will provide excellent products and service , which will result in the   achievement of organizational goals at the end of the day . So it ’s a win - win situation , if you benefit an   employee , it will multiply the benefit actually . 

 I also explained how sometimes addressing the needs of one individual can impact everyone for the   better , even if it seems extreme or out of the ordinary . So best results only come when each and every   team member is progressing and growing , so I explained the importance of helping the one lacking   behind , and inspiring them to join us to the same progressed level . 

 Insight & Approach     That was my first courageous experience . I always believe in compassion and empathy , and that I used in   my approach too , I told my teammate that to make her mark in the company she needs to be confident in   herself , her skills and work . Help her understand that it ’s okay if she lacks in any skill , learning has no 

 age or defined period , and it ’s always the perfect time to learn when you realize you need to learn . When I   convinced her that it ’s okay to be neglected and excluded , your time will come , like I struggled to make   my mark here , so can she . 

 I asked my senior heads to weekly arrange beneficial e - learning sessions and trainings from the experts   within the company which are open to all and everyone ( from junior to senior level ) can join / attend and   are welcomed . Because everyone is more than welcome to learn what they do n’t know and want to learn   so that way she does n’t feel targeted or inferior and can easily attend the sessions .   This worked really well . She really needed compassion and listening ear for that brief time to share her   story , and she ended up with a true support . She was so motivated then to practice all she was learning   and I want them to pick her instead of me so that she can feel empowered . 

 The examples of the tools in this course made me see these story - telling and visualization tool in a new   way . I 've used it as an ad hoc tool , but now I ’m learning to prepare ahead in my career and assist me in   presenting my ideas and best illustrate them better . 

 I have a tech background , but I ended up as a managerial level compassionate work more than my field   related work . I had no idea this would ever be considered an asset , but I am so very grateful that it is   actually !

"Reflection   ­   Mind   Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I ’m   a   Design   Consultant   in   an   organisation .   The   challenge   was   to   search   the   opportunities    where   the   client   ( A   Leading   Train   Manufacturer )   can   make   the   biggest   impact   in   the   industry    by   innovation   using   latest   technologies .   These   days ,   passengers   have   many   options   to    commute ,   which   are   very   easily   available ,   they   can   call   the   cab   anytime ,   anywhere .    Nowadays ,   somehow   passenger   are   not   very   inclined   to   choose   trains   as   a   daily   transport .    How   can   we   make   trains   smarter   and   user   friendly . 

 Selection 

 I   chose   <NAME>   mapping   tool   taught   by   <NAME> <NAME> .   <NAME>   mapping   tool   is   a   quickest   way   to    gather   more   ideas .   It   can   give   you   more   ideas   connecting   to   main   central   topic .   These   ideas    and   relationships   become   very   effective   points   can   become   insights   to   find   the   scope .   It   is    also   know   as   creative ,   intuitive   and   innovative   design   thinking   tool . 

 Application 

 I   found   a   big   hall   having   the   capacity   to   sit   around   10   people   with   a   large   whiteboard .   I    conducted   this   session   with   stakeholders   and   a   group   of   different   passengers .   We   wanted   to    capture   the   mind   of   the   passengers .   I   distributed   a   bold   pen   and   different   colors   of   sticky    notes   to   the   participant .       I   started   the   process   by   asking   a   brief   introduction   about   themselves   ( each   participant   one    by   one ) ,   so   that   everybody   knows   each   other   a   bit   about   what   they   do .   Then   I   re­phrased    the   topic   in   front   of   them   again ,   although   they   already   had   the   idea   what   is   the   topic   and   we    are   going   to   do .    Then   I   wrote   the   main   topic   on   center   of   white   board .   Then   I   broke   down   the   main   topic   to    subtopic   branches ,   on   the   basis   of   my   research   and   available   data   and   the   response   coming    from   group .      After   that ,   I   asked   participant   to   have   related   ideas   around   them ,   and   present   one   by   one    his / her   sticky   notes   and   paste   around   the   related   topic   or   subtopic .   During   presentation   of    sticky   notes   participant   shared   their   thought   what   comes   in   his / her   mind .   That   gives   us   a    base   to   discover   new   relation   between   the   keywords .   In   our   case   ‘ Train ’   was   the   main   topic ,    and   subtopics   were   like   customers ,   technology ,   baggages   etc .   Points   were   coming   out    automatically   from   other   points .   I   give   them   30   minutes   for   each   section . 

 I   splitted   the   whole   session   in   few   small   sections   on   the   basis   of   processes .   For   example    while   booking   the   train ,   what   are   points   come   in   their   mind ,   so   I   wrote   again   on   the   board    and   ask   participant   to   have   ideas   around   that ,   write   on   sticky   notes   and   paste   close   to   the    topic .   In   the   same   way ,   what   comes   in   the   mind   while   you   are   in   train .      From   above   exercise   we   got   lot   of   ideas   like   what   happens ,   if   you   miss   the   train ,   if   you   do n’t    get   seats   etc .       Then   I   gave   them   10   minutes   to   review   their   own   sticky   notes .   Then   we   grouped   the   sticky    notes   on   the   basis   of   similar   theme   and   patterns .       At   the   end   of   session   I   asked   them   to   vote   the   ideas   by   just   adding   dot   to   sticky   notes   which    were   pasted   on   whiteboard .   It   was   like   the   main   keyword   or   outliers .   They   may   serve    inspirations .   After   that ,   I   synthesized   then   digitised   them   and   created   a   report   to   find   the    pattern   and   theme . 

 Insights 

 Well ,   after   conducting   this   exercise   we   had   a   better   understanding   of   ‘ what   is ’ ,   the   current    problems   and   it   gave   us   a   solid   foundation   for   next   exercise   that   is   ‘ what   if ’ .   It   was   a   lot   of    fun ,   and   everybody   enjoyed   this   session .   Now   we   can   sense   that   why   people   are   moving    away   from   trains ,   what   are   their   problems   space   with   train .   Like   train   travel   takes   a   lot   of    efforts   and   has   lot   of   uncertainty ,   availability   of   parking ,   connecting   trains ,   seat   availability ,    dirty   toilets ,   etc .    We   had   several   outlines   to   discuss   further .   We   discussed   about   this   complete   session   again    with   stakeholders   and   find   the   way   to   have   a   big   impact   on   this   industry .    I   found   this   tool   intuitive   to   gather   lots   of   ideas   very   quickly .   It   was   my   first   project   and    learned   a   lot   by   having   shared   understanding   with   different   kind   of   passenger   e.g.   techy ,    late   comers ,   disables ,   very   busy   people   etc .    It   helped   us   to   identify   the   insights   relating   to   each   keyword .   Then   translate   the   insight   into    design   criteria .   Now   we   can   move   on   to   thinking   about   possible   solutions   to   our   design    challenges . 

 Approach 

 Next   time ,   I   will   clearly   say   that   on­one   is   going   to   judge   any   body .   I   experienced   in   this    session   that   if   someone   giving   the   idea ,   another   person   was   stopping   and   judging .   Because    of   this   problems ,   some   participant   were   getting   defensive   about   their   ideas   which   resulted    to   limited   ideas .   This   problem   remained   there   for   a   short   while   after   that   this   session   went    well .

"Reflection - Storytelling 

 First of all , sorry for my English level . 

 <ADDRESS> and selection 

 When I was a child I used to watch a TV program “ Brothers Grimm tales ” , that was the best   way for me to travel , to transport my mind to other countries , other cultures , that was a   way to live new experiences and learn . 

 Nowadays I work as a consultant in productivity , responsible for guiding companies in how   to produce more and better . My job is training people in different levels , machine   operators , supervisors , managers , etc . During this process I have asked myself what do   people have in common in their learning process ? And what is the best way to teach and   learn . After years of experiences I identified that the best way to connect with these people   is telling a story , transporting these people to events that have happened to you or to   anyone in other factories , in other process . Even I invent a story to explain a new concept ,   they act as characters of this story and the way that they learn the concepts is easier and   funny . 

 Application 

 One of the tools that I use in my courses is “ Job instruction ” this is a method to instruct an   operator how to perform a job correctly , safely and conscientiously . I use storytelling to   teach this method , I have invented a story about a rescue boat , people who are being   trained are part of this rescue boat , they must learn different activities , the first one is that   they must learn how to tie a rescue knot , I explain them that this is a very important activity   because this is used to rescue people in the ocean , so it must be done very well . I give them   the rope , glasses and everything what they need for this activity . After following the   method , try some times , make mistakes , and have fun , they learn the process to train   people correctly , safely and conscientiously . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Applying this tool I have learned that the best way to train is creating empathy with the   people , most of all identify with experiences that others have lived , when you tell a story ,   people feel identified , connect with you , even enjoy the story and open their minds . As   leader this is an excellent tool to engage attention , inspire action and be a more persuasive .   People move by emotions . 

 In companies training process , storytelling can be used to organize information that can   provide structured learning .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 Waste disposal in college campus has been one of major problem I had to deal 

 with . One must think of this as very trivial challenge for design thinking . A simple solution to this challenge is to install waste - bins all over university campus . Although one might be tempted to end discussion with simple solution , this problem , I believe needs more thought . I am from <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . Here people tend to dispose waste on public grounds , litter empty juice cans , toffee wrappers , plastic bags on road . This is a sociocultural problem which could not be solved by installing waste disposal bins . Students are not interested in finding one and disposing instead of littering . Littering also leads to pollution , outbreak of seasonal diseases etc . We needed to find much better solution for this issue . 

 Selection 

 I choose learning launch as a design tool for this challenge . Learning launch is a 

 small experiment that tests an idea in real environment or a real market place . It follows the principle of fail cheap and fast instead of building large scale plans and failing incurring huge losses . I think learning launch is an amazing design for this challenge as it helps us in finding flaws in our plan and perfect it . We could track how students respond to a solution and this gives us a chance to improvise . 

 Application 

 First our group of student committee brainstormed for exact problem we face . 

 Years of conditioning to throw waste around public places was one of them . So interest should be generated among student population in proper waste disposal . We created survey forms , passed it around faculty and students to inquire about the reluctance in using normal waste bins , what would spark interest in using them , how they feel while using one and while not using a waste bin , etc . A lot of responses were received and analyzed . 

 We decided to create an IoT based waste bin and test one in most crowded place 

 in campus . It had automatic opening system . A mobile app was made specifically for this and people were awarded points based on amount of waste they disposed . Students could track their points with that mobile app . Every week a winner was selected and awarded special titles . 

 Response from student community was mind - blowing . At first only very few 

 students started using it . Then number of students grew rapidly . Winner series became a hit and competitions became high . Since that one bin became success we decided to implement the same in different parts of campus . As a result of these efforts campus became waste free and much more beautiful than before . 

 Insights 

 Even with this idea we never expected this outcome . Interest shown by students 

 were really good . More than the interest in the product what shocked us was sheer support by faculty , students in realizing this project . A positive change in very few people ’s outlook could be projected outwards and gradually it can change the entire society . These waste bins were installed only inside campus , but people started using waste bins even when they are out somewhere else . More students came with ideas to 

 improvise these . We thus succeeded in creating a new positive outlook among student community which supported proper waste disposal methods and recycling . 

 Approach 

 Learning launch was a very good technique to use for this particular challenge . 

 But all the data collected from students and faculty were analyzed collectively by our student committee and every member focused on what they found to be a very good idea . This resulted in loss of many other ideas and factors which were ignored by majority members . Also in this method opinion of one member can influence opinion of other . So I would combine it with mind mapping technique . In mind mapping we could arrange all the data extracted into various groups and then displayed . Every member would not down what they find interesting and at the end these suggestions can be pasted on a board and can be easily analyzed . In this way we can ensure that every member is equally given a chance to present their opinions without influence of anyone else . This can result in much better idea generation and brain storming sessions .

"Visualization 

 Challenges & Selection 

 While I am working as the coordinator of business , I used to face some circumstances that I should describe something in a simple and clear way . In that case , I prefer to build some structure and drawings taking into account relationships between each matter and topic that are raised during the meeting . That ’s why I started with Visualization that I mostly prefer to communicate in the workplace . 

 There was a big challenge for me to set out the MBO in a new platform for some people who have been using it for a long time under their own management style and other people who have never experienced MBO for their management . It was very difﬁcult to change something that people used to do in their own way and to start new thing which is the additional works for them with the limited time . 

 Application 

 I tried to organize two different approaches for dealing with both different parties in order not to make any confusion on this new system . For the ﬁrst group who have been using MBO under their management way , I tried to structuralize the difference between the classiﬁcation and deﬁnition of each indicator used in the past and the new ones for new MBO to be revised by making the two different simple tables to be able to easily identify which part will be changed and updated . 

 For the second group who have never experienced for MBO system , I made a global explanation tool to be able to make people access whenever they want to look into the details , and on top of that , I made the chart to show the structure of MBO and the ﬁnal goal and methodologies that we will take for inputting data . 

 After that , some people get accustomed to what the MBO is and What for , I tried to go into detail step by step . Also , I ran some exercises in front of them to show how it is working and how we can manage data in a simple way . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I learned from this project is that the most important thing was how people feel it when they got this information ﬁrst . If it seems to be difﬁcult and complicated , it was not easy to make people be interested in what I have shown . Also , I took into consideration the convenience as much as possible for people who will directly use this tool and system by restructuring all relevant documents to be able to avoid any duplicate input and information . 

 So , it allowed me to help people in a practical way , and also to proceed with many supports from all parties . I have recognized again that the simple and clear message with the impressive view always makes people be interested and remember this information easily .

"Challenge 

 Our campus organization for Electronics Engineers ( ECE ) strives for academic assistance for the 

 students . As one of the key officers , we organize events that will help students gain additional knowledge   that they might not be able to learn during lectures and also assist them in the courses they are currently   taking . And being a student myself , we are attracted and constantly looking for things and events that are   interesting - at - first - sight . Not only that , we are also looking for such things that can maintain its interesting   side until the end of the program . Traditional knowledge - sharing events ( i.e. seminars ) can be interesting but   not catchy to some . With this , to provide creative solutions to aid our fellow Electronics Engineering students   with their academic studies became a part of our organization ’s agenda . 

 In our institution , the culture of seeking help from senior students had developed and somewhat 

 improved the students ’ performance , especially if the seniors that they asked helped from are close to them .   This also became one of the organization ’s agenda , to unite the members comprising from seniors to   freshmen . 

 Selection 

 The key officers , though informally , chose the Learning Launch tool to see if the ideas they developed 

 are effective . Before using the tool , the team brainstormed for ideas on the problem on how to assist students   in their major academic courses ( Mathematics , Electronics , General Sciences , etc . ) all the while introducing   them to the seniors . <NAME> <NAME> was used so that different ideas could be experimented on the group   of students interested in taking part of the launching of our ideas . 

 Application 

 During the brainstorming , it was brought up that peer mentoring has shown its effectiveness to some 

 students . It was brought up that students learn more when they are comfortable around the instructor . Some   factors that increases comfort of the student to the instructor are : the age gap , enthusiasm of the instructor ,   and his friendliness . And around that time , the culture of the juniors asking assistance from seniors were   already around but not prevalent . Thus , for the first school year implementation of <NAME> <NAME> , groups   were assembled in which each group comprises of at least 2 seniors and 4 lower classmen . Each group has   to log the date and time of the peer mentoring session but it was up to the group members of how they will   reach out to each other and manage the topics that they can tackle . During this first implementation , I was a   participant since I was n’t one of the key officers yet . But at that time , I could say that it was ineffective due to   the seniors ’ unresponsiveness , the conflict of schedules , and lack of monitoring from the organizing team . 

 The following year , it was decided to accommodate as many lower classmen as it takes . There were 

 brainstorming sessions again regarding the flow of the program . It was then decided that the students or   interested participants will be grouped according to their year level . The mentoring sessions and the courses   to be tackled or reviewed will be according to the responses of the participants . The seniors were the tutors   and were given the courses that they will review to the students . All sessions of all groups were done in a   single day , courses having a limited time for review . The three groups – 1st , 2nd and 3rd years – had their   sessions in parallel . At a certain time period , three different seniors are teaching 3 different courses , each for   the respective groups . And for the next time slot , these tutors will either exchange or be replaced . At this 

 point , I think the effectiveness was reduced since the ratio of a senior to lower classmen in a group was   around 1:20 . Though the purpose of peer mentoring and getting to know the seniors are still present . 

 Insight 

 The assigned tool could be effective if implemented properly . For me , this tool helps prove ideas and 

 experiments that the methods were effective . But along with the implementation of this tool , there must be a   strict time management for the experimentation processes , great planning before execution of experiments ,   and effective manpower management . 

 From the activity and from the lessons , I realized and learned the importance of your subject ’s needs . 

 These needs can help generate ideas that can be used to develop interesting and effective experimentations .   We wanted our activities to be enticing and helpful to the students . 

 Approach 

 I think the Learning Launch best fits this kind of projects of the organization . But perhaps if combined 

 with the ethnographic tool that can aid us in dwelling deeper in the students ’ specific needs , we can develop   better ideas for experimentation . Our Learning Launch relied on our experiences as ordinary students and   limited responses from others . We can up our game if we get to know the students on a personal level and   generate helpful ideas .

"Reflection – IT Customer Service - Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 With the explosion of online services , our company , which provides IT services to other small and medium scale   companies is facing challenge of identifying the priority and severity of issues when a customer or customer   infrastructure experiences problem . Problem gets bounced between various departments even before proper diagnosis   is done . I intend to use Visualization or Visual Thinking approach to get a shared understanding between various   departments and levels . I have used whiteboarding , flow chart , straw man visualization of various problem domains   and their relationships with set of simple questions and prompts for various stake holders for discussion and scoring   of issue from their perspective . This helped identifying priority , key elements , scope , boundaries and relationship   between elements and departments . This detailed level visualization helped identify key issues to consider when we   identify improved process and solutions . 

 Application 

 Before I even start the Visual Thinking , a small group of experts ( Digital Transformers ) consists of departments collect   the current processes , tools , number of issues each department solves and other relevant monthly reports , KPI ( key   performance indicators ) various departments use . Have each of the member to conduct a survey / informal interviews   to collect relevant material to augment the documented materials . 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man graphic , I will   draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing material may be operational or   procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or other auditing reports . If materials are not   available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the stakeholders who serve as my main points of   contact on the initiative . 

 As mentioned in the example assignment , if appropriate to the situation , I will borrow strategies and approaches   mentioned in <NAME> <NAME> ’s book , “ The Connected Company ” to identify internal services to identify Partners and   Value Chain Providers ( we already work with vendors for various internal and customer services ) . The “ front- stage / back - stage ” approach helps us identify key elements and relationships between and internal and external   stakeholders . The straw man graph / diagram will utilize simple online tools like draw.io and Google Docs to visualize   and collaborate . Once High - level graphic is ready poster - size board is created . 

 Once the relevant material is available , For the activity , I will enroll a large group of people and divide into smaller   5 - 6 participants each representing different departments and levels . Each group will receive a poster - size copy , sticky   notes and easel board for internal discussion and updated graphic from their perspective and will be grouped in a   separate table . Each group will be tasked to prioritize a set of issues and 2 - 3 questions to answer . I give them 20 mins   to complete the task and give questions after completing the tasks . Each group will be given opportunity to make a   presentation of their priority list and answers to the questions . Update the poster board with their modifications . I   record each group list and answers . I recreate <NAME> <NAME> and draw.io diagram to reflect each group – group think .   After Discussion , Updated Document reflects the shared knowledge and additional details , as it contains feedback and   changes the group agreed upon . I will create a template for future Visual Thinking exercises relevant to our company .   This will be used as guide to future sessions to further enhance the process thru Iterations . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Insight from the session and approach I have taken has helped us create a sustainable process to involve and enhance   shared knowledge of technical capabilities , identify problem types and categories , prioritize them . This helped identify   some of the issues involved in solving problems with in internal and external stakeholders . The graphical   representation provided various stakeholders to provide feedback and shared understanding on the process and   bottlenecks in the system .   It also helped identify other KPI that needs to observe by the managers and executives to   help engineers to focus on the issues , external bottlenecks that are not in control of internal stakeholders . It provided   template for future sessions to expand the services , identify relationship between them , identify bottlenecks in   collaborating between internal and external stakeholders .

"Mind mapping 

 The   first phase of design thinking process , 

 At what is . .in doing so , we amass a huge amount of data . Before moving to the next phase , what if , we   need to distil all that data into information and insights that can be easily communicated . 

 Mind mapping is looking for patterns and insights in a large quantity of data you collected during   your exploration of what is the current reality . 

 This phase is pivotal in the design thinking process . Mind mapping provides a Segway from what is to   what if . its an engaging alternative to that giant report we might otherwise have written to sum up and   communicate in prose and charts and spreadsheets 

 Mind mapping is more intuitive . It 's more creative . It 's more visual , and it 's more engaging .          <NAME>   <NAME> , the founder of IDEO said , when I want to do something analytical , I make a list . 

 When I 'm trying to do something creative , I make a mind - map . That said , let 's be clear what we do n't   mean by mind - mapping and the design - thinking process . 

 In design thinking we use the mind mapping process to capture and represent the minds of our   customers . That 's minds , of our customers . We involve our colleagues in order to develop a   common mind among them regarding the current reality of a design challenge . 

 Through mind mapping , we extract meaning from data in a way that lets patterns and insights emerge .   But the design thinking process of generating the map , deliberately involves many stakeholders .   Standing of the current reality . This can be a big help as you move forward in the design process .   Now   be sure you 've reminded them of the design challenge so they have that mind as they browse . Ask them   to take note of what fits , as well as what does n't fit . Sometimes the good stuff is what appears to be an   outlier . After the participants have viewed the gallery , ask them to return to the workshop   room , arranging themselves at tables of five to six participants each . 

 Before they start to share their good stuff , give them about ten minutes to review their own sticky notes   and group them into themed clusters on their clipboard . Then the sharing starts . Have one member of   the team start with the theme presenting his or her sticky notes related to that theme . Put these on a   large foam core board , a wall , or whatever so that the whole team can see them . Then another team   member adds their sticky notes that are related to that same thing . The next team member does the   same . Then a second team member will suggest another theme , and so forth , until all the sticky notes   are on the board . Yes . Even the outliers go on the board . Stick them around the edges . They may work   their way in later . 

 And they may serve as , inspiration in some way you have n’t anticipated . Identifying the insights that   each cluster reveals . This is also one of the toughest parts of the process . Your participants have to   move from a theme that has probably been more like a label , for example guilt or no time , which is easy 

 to come up with . To an insight statement . An insight statement is more than just a word . Your   participants have made observations . Now they must turn those observations into insights . They need   to uncover what 's implied by the observations . A good way to get this started is to ask , so what ? You   might need to ask , so what several times . Continue until meaningful insight statements emerge . For   instance , guilt becomes people avoid thinking about their health , because it makes them uncomfortable   to realize they are really in charge . No time becomes people ca n't see how to work an exercise routine   into their daily lives . The pivot between what is and what if , is the generation of a design criteria   statement . The topic of design criteria , an important project management aid , is covered in more depth   elsewhere . But for now , just know that design criteria are the conditions your design solution must   satisfy in order to solve your customer 's problem . These are conditions based on the insights   you 've uncovered through your deep understanding of what is . For instance , your solution to the   exercise problem , will have to be one that the user can easily fit into their day . Now , a compelling way   to generate design criteria , is to ask yourself , if anything were possible , if anything were possible , what   criteria would our new design meet . Once you have your design criteria in hand , you 'll be ready to move   on to thinking about possible solutions to your design challenge .

 Introduction      As​ ​a​ ​designer,​ ​one​ ​challenge​ ​that​ ​I​ ​often​ ​face​ ​is​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​strong​ ​branding​ ​for​ ​my​ ​clients .   Branding​ ​is​ ​much​ ​more​ ​than​ ​a​ ​logo​ ​and​ ​nice​ ​colors,​ ​it​ ​involves​ ​research,​ ​strategy,​ ​creation ,   <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ​the​ ​company​ ​and​ ​employees​ ​values​ ​must​ ​be   reflected​ ​in​ ​the​ ​branding,​ ​a​ ​deep​ ​investigation​ ​must​ ​be​ ​realized​ ​in​ ​early​ ​stages​ ​to​ ​capture   elements​ ​and​ ​values​ ​of​ ​the​ ​company​ ​and​ ​its​ ​employees​ ​that​ ​will​ ​match​ ​with​ ​clients   expectations.​ ​Branding​ ​structure​ ​can​ ​be​ ​divided​ ​into​ ​4​ ​segments;​ ​graphic​ ​elements​ ​(logo​ ​and   colors),​ ​user​ ​experience,​ ​voice,​ ​and​ ​character .     To​ ​achieve​ ​brand​ ​character​ ​you​ ​must​ ​incorporate​ ​on​ ​it​ ​human​ ​characteristics​ ​to​ ​achieve   personality.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​more​ ​than​ ​just​ ​an​ ​appearance;​ ​it’s​ ​an​ ​experience.​ ​People​ ​connect​ ​with   your​ ​brand​ ​and​ ​whatever​ ​meaning​ ​they​ ​assign​ ​to​ ​it​ ​is​ ​due​ ​to​ ​its​ ​personality .     Brand​ ​personalities​ ​can​ ​be​ ​classified​ ​as​ ​archetypes.​ <NAME> ​Jung​ ​described​ ​archetypes​ ​as   universal​ ​collective​ ​patterns​ ​of​ ​the​ ​unconscious.​ ​As​ ​per​ ​Margaret​ <NAME> <NAME> ​Carol​ ​S.   Pearson,​ ​“Archetypes​ ​are​ ​the​ ​heartbeat​ ​of​ ​a​ ​brand​ ​because​ ​they​ ​convey​ ​a​ ​meaning​ ​that   makes​ ​customers​ ​relate​ <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ​as​ ​if​ ​it​ ​actually​ ​were​ ​alive​ ​in​ ​some​ ​way”.​ ​Because​ ​they   are​ <NAME> <NAME> ​and​ ​unconscious​ ​themes​ ​of​ ​humanity,​ ​we​ ​can​ ​always​ ​connect​ ​to   archetypal​ ​stories .     There​ ​are​ ​12​ ​master​ ​archetypes​ ​and​ ​they​ ​are​ ​a​ ​great​ ​way​ ​for​ ​companies​ ​to​ ​‘manage   meaning’​ ​in​ ​a​ ​structured​ ​way:​ ​the​ ​creator,​ ​the​ ​hero,​ ​the​ ​outlaw,​ ​the​ ​lover,​ ​the​ ​everyman,​ ​the   <NAME> ​the​ ​explorer,​ ​the​ ​innocent,​ ​the​ ​ruler,​ ​the​ ​jester,​ ​the​ ​caregiver​ ​and​ ​the​ ​magician .     The​ ​challenge     A​ ​software​ ​company​ ​that​ ​provides​ ​human​ ​capital​ ​management​ ​solutions​ ​is​ ​struggling​ ​with   awareness​ ​and​ ​consequently​ ​not​ ​generating​ ​many​ ​leads​ ​or​ ​selling​ ​the​ ​products.​ ​The   marketing​ ​team​ ​keeps​ ​changing​ ​strategies​ ​trying​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​the​ ​frequent​ ​change​ ​of​ ​business   directions​ ​generated​ ​by​ ​the​ ​executive​ <NAME> <NAME> ​don’t​ ​quite​ ​understand​ ​the​ ​power   of​ ​a​ ​strong​ ​branding​ ​and​ ​how​ ​that​ ​would​ ​help​ ​them​ ​to​ ​sell​ ​more .     Insight      I​ ​believe​ ​that​ ​a​ ​strong​ ​brand​ ​must​ ​be​ ​created​ ​by​ ​a​ ​collaboration​ ​process​ ​involving   stakeholders,​ ​employees,​ ​customers,​ ​design,​ ​and​ ​marketing.​ ​Some​ ​meetings​ ​are​ ​scheduled   to​ ​stimulate​ ​the​ ​discussion​ ​and​ ​sketch​ ​people​ ​vision​ ​and​ ​minds​ ​about​ ​the​ ​branding​ ​meaning .     Selection​ ​and​ ​application    I​ ​have​ ​chosen​ ​mindmaps​ ​as​ ​the​ ​main​ ​tool​ ​to​ ​capture​ ​people​ ​vision​ ​about​ ​the​ ​ideal​ ​archetype   for​ ​the​ ​branding.​ ​I​ ​divide​ ​the​ ​process​ ​into​ <NAME> ​few​ ​meetings​ ​where​ ​all​ ​involved​ ​will​ ​have​ ​the   opportunity​ ​to​ ​showcase​ ​and​ ​also​ ​be​ ​challenged​ ​to​ ​defend​ ​their​ ​point​ ​of​ ​view.​ ​The​ ​process​ ​is   the​ ​following : 

 First​ ​meeting:​ ​Understanding​ ​that​ ​not​ ​everybody​ ​in​ ​the​ ​meeting​ ​was​ ​educated​ ​in​ ​branding   process​ ​or​ ​familiar​ ​with​ ​archetypes,​ ​I​ ​start​ ​the​ ​process​ ​with​ <NAME> <NAME> ​to​ ​clarify​ ​the   meaning​ ​of​ ​it.​ ​After​ ​that,​ ​I​ ​invite​ ​participants​ ​to​ ​think​ ​which​ ​archetypes​ ​the​ ​company​ ​or   product​ ​would​ ​fit​ ​and​ ​ask​ ​them​ ​to​ ​come​ ​to​ ​the​ ​next​ ​meeting​ ​with​ ​visual​ ​images​ ​of​ ​many   movie​ ​characters,​ ​singers,​ ​actors,​ ​songs,​ ​artists,​ ​etc.​ ​that​ ​has​ ​an​ ​emotional​ ​trigger​ ​on​ ​him .   For​ ​example,​ ​if​ ​the​ ​participant​ ​chooses​ ​the​ ​archetype​ ​rebel,​ ​he​ ​or​ ​she​ ​can​ ​bring​ ​to​ ​the​ ​next   meeting​ ​some​ ​images​ ​of​ ​James​ ​Dean,​ ​Madonna,​ ​Harley - Davidsons​ ​or​ ​whatever​ ​image​ ​he   thinks​ ​that​ ​has​ ​an​ ​emotional​ ​rebel​ ​component​ ​to​ ​him .   Second​ ​meeting:​ ​With​ ​all​ ​archetypes​ ​selected,​ ​and​ ​with​ ​this​ ​visual​ ​data​ ​os​ ​images   collected,​ ​the​ ​participants​ ​are​ ​invited​ ​to​ ​explain​ ​why​ ​they​ ​think​ ​that​ ​is​ ​the​ ​best​ ​archetype​ ​to   reflect​ ​the​ ​branding.​ ​The​ ​participants​ ​are​ ​free​ ​to​ ​change​ ​their​ ​minds​ ​whenever​ ​they​ ​want​ ​to .   The​ ​main​ ​idea​ ​is​ ​to​ ​ramp​ ​up​ ​the​ ​discussions​ ​and​ ​boost​ ​the​ ​stakeholder's​ ​creativity.​ ​After   that,​ ​participants​ ​will​ ​receive​ ​blank​ ​printed​ ​storyboards​ ​where​ ​they​ ​will​ ​be​ ​asked​ ​to​ ​write   and / or​ ​draw​ ​stories​ ​where​ ​the​ ​product / service​ ​would​ ​act​ ​as​ ​the​ ​archetype​ ​selected.​ ​The   stories​ ​will​ ​be​ ​revised​ ​at​ ​the​ ​next​ ​meeting .   <NAME> ​meeting:​ ​This​ ​meeting​ ​is​ ​the​ ​most​ ​productive​ ​and​ ​fun​ ​meeting​ <NAME> <NAME> ​Stakeholders   will​ ​present​ ​their​ ​stories​ ​and​ ​this​ <NAME> <NAME> ​will​ <NAME> <NAME> ​stories​ ​in​ ​the​ ​group​ ​mind .

 Assignment : Reflection – Storytelling 

 Design Thinking Innovation ( University of Virginia ) 

 <NAME> <NAME>   6/14/2020 

 Reflection - StoryTelling 

 Challenge & Selection   I work for an Insurance company based out of <ADDRESS> . My respective department is Innovation & Digital   Transformation . I work with the Analytics , IT and Business Teams closely to discover better ideas and   solutions to increase business efficiency and profitability . Our team comprises of 6 employees , each   from a different background and having multiple skill sets . In Insurance Industry , we are the risk takers   for any consumer and in exchange of Premium ( Amount paid by the consumer to protect an asset in   case of any uncertainty ) , we assure them a promise . For the consumer , the only value that he / she has   from an Insurance document is the service . For us , customer satisfaction matters the most and is an   important component for us to renew that customer for her/ his future needs as well . The basic motto   of our department is to develop certain tools and methods to provide customer a seamless service in   purchase of policy and a efficient experience in claim settlement . A customer can have various claims in   his lifetime , like health , motor or any general Insurance Claim . Its our duty to be the best on the ground   and help the customer in all sort of ways . We give our best as an organization , but its always important   for us to keep our customer ’s demand and expectations in mind too . It might be that we would be   thinking from an organizational point of view keeping profit / loss in mind , but its always important to   hear the customer too . During the Coronavirus Pandemic , we decided to have a conversation with our   golden customers and listen to them . Surprisingly , we came across a unilateral view that we were still   being a Traditional Insurance Company and we had great opportunities in the Digital Field . For us the   focus was now , not to be only an Insurance Provider but also a Tech savy company with digital solutions   on the go . We had to deliver digital solutions to the customer , where he could instantly claim for   settlement in case of any loss , i.e. , the customer need not follow up with the <ADDRESS> / customer care   executives or go to the Insurance Office with a lot of policy documents , but instantly receive a claim   settlement at the comfort of his location . 

 Selection   The reason for selecting the <NAME> telling tool was intimating all the teams the consumer experiences .   We have a duty of covering their losses in case of any uncertainty and we wanted to view the digital   solutions that could be provided by the organization for digital claim settlement , efficiently and   paperless . 

 Application   We had a word with around 40 - 50 customers and all of them had a unilateral view of digital claim   settlement . No one wanted to get out of their home for any claim issues and wanted to solve it from   his / her place itself . We had a word with the IT Team and they said we would require a streamlined data   structure aligned with the company ’s website with real time tracking of the claim . I remember giving   them an example of a lady who was in her mid 70s , she had to claim for her husband ’s health expenses 

 and she was in a complete mess with respect to understanding the Claims Procedure and the steps to be   take for claim settlement . The TAT for any settlement is 7 days but it took 20 days for her to complete   this process . We had to design a structure which could instantly allow the user to upload all the   necessary documents on the portal and ask for a claim settlement on the go . It was difficult to start with   all the verticals together so we planned to take Motor Claims as a priority and started working on it .   There are various documents which are required from the Customer ’s side for a motor claim and he / she   also has to travel to the Service Station for the Claims Process . We came on a conclusion to automate   the entire claim process . With the help of Business Teams , IT Team & our Customer Support Team , we   hosted a helpline , anyone who had a claim could just call on the given contact details and start the   procedure . The following steps were to be followed : 

    Call the Helpline . 

    Register the Claim , Mention Policy Details and the Insuree name . 

    Provide the details of the Car ’s location and if any assistance was required ( car to be taken to   the service station/ picked up from home ) 

    Upload the necessary documents   on the web portal 

    Track the claim 

    Car drop to Customer after the claim being settled and the car being repaired 

 Insight   After this process being launched for our Motor Claim Vertical , we went on ground and had a feedback   session with all our Motor Claim customers . They all were very much satisfied and they also encouraged   us to start this process for all our verticals . We took it as a challenge and started thinking on various   modules on how we can provide value to the customer . We recently are building a customer ’s app   which could help the customer raise a claim without calling the <ADDRESS> and just uploading the video/   image of the car . The process would become more efficient and could help company save on various   expenses as well . It could make our company the first mover on <NAME> <NAME> , first in the industry   with Instant Claim Settlement Quotations . Though it needs a lot of data modeling and IT Support , we are   building are infrastructure for the same as this is the defined future . 

 Approach   For us as an organization , the StoryTelling Tool , really worked well . For any organization , its necessary to   listen to its customers and the services that they might be expecting for better brand building and   increasing sales as well . I think these customer experiences , mattered the most for all the teams and   they were working to achieve a common target , i.e. , <NAME> <NAME> . 

 Over the months , our customer base has increased rapidly . The customer is fully satisfied with the   services and we also have achieved an increment % in retaining our valuable customers . We are nomore   a traditional insurance company but a tech savy Insurance Providers .

"Mind mapping ( <NAME> 3 ) 

 1 . Challenge 

 Three years ago , I had to lead a workshop in a French large bank , with a public of about twenty   Business and IT executives . 

 The first part of the meeting was to show them the state of the art of the artificial intelligence   technologies for creating new banking services . 

 The second part of the meeting was to identify and explore several possibilities for them to create   new services for their customers , where we used mind mapping . 

 2 . Selection 

 The room for the meeting was well equipped , with walls where we can fix large papers and write and   scotch post - it . We also had several tables where we can divide the population in small groups . 

 We have used this to create several mind maps , one for the whole group in order to collect ideas in a   first step , and others – one for each group - to illustrate the ideas we collected . The mind mapping   tool seems to be the best tool for this work because it is one of the most powerful tool of the design   thinking toolbox , and it is perfectly adapted for contexts where we have to be creative and visual . 

 3 . Application 

 First , we have collected ideas : we have given each participant of the workshop several post - it where   they had to write a small description of the ideas for the next challenges in their banking   environment . We collected all these papers and we put them of the first global mind map . During   this work , we have had about one hundred of ideas . We have visually organized these ideas on the   paper fixed on the wall , and our graphical facilitator illustrated this with the different comment made   by the participants . Them , with a collective voting process , we have selected the four most important   challenges we wanted to explore . 

 Second , we have separated the participants in four groups . Each group had to explore one idea and   imagine how can artificial intelligence address the challenge , by example with the creating of a new   service , or y the improvement of an existing one . For the moment , the objective was only to illustrate   IA in the challenge , and not to identify the solution ( this point was addressed later during a second   workshop ) . 

 For this job , we have given the 4 groups , several magazines , markers , paper scissor , glue sticks and a   large paper . They have to use all these materials to create a support for illustrate their subject . Our   graphical facilitator was in the room , and he was moving from table to table to assist to groups in this   work . We was also completing their work with illustrations with the markers . 

 At the end for this work , the four groups have shown their work in front of all participants , and to   defend their ideas . 

 4 . Insight 

 The workshop was a success , and the use of mind mapping was a great idea , for the following   reasons : 

 -   it is a visual tool , and all participants understood easily the ideas shown of the papers . 

 -   It is easy to create a collaborative approach inside the group , in a positive way . This leads to   the emergence of a large number of ideas and comments 

 -   We had at the end of the meeting a support with the paper constituted together , wich was   part of the minute of the workshop 

 5 . Approach 

 I’am very satisfied for the use of mind mapping for this meeting but one lesson I learned was about   the timekeeping . Once the participants are launched in their cutting work for magazines and sticking   them in a large paper , the wanted to be perfectionists and it is easy for them to get lot in graphical   useless details . When we organize such meeting , I now think that we have to define a maximal time   for the work and to announce in the beginning of the workshop that the most important if not the   graphical quality of the mind map , but the ideas they find . 

 Second important point for this case : I have given whole magazines to the participants and they   have to find the picture before cutting and sticking them . If I have to redo such workshop , I would   directly prepare a large set of picture and cutting myself the magazines in order to facilitate their   work . I think that this preliminary job is a good accelerator for this kind ofmeeting .

"RP- Design - thinking - lab - work - using - Learning Launch . 

 Challenge    One of our clients envisioned to keep abreast with the latest changes in technology and wished to have   business transformation coupled with resolution of some of the lessons learnt and process changes   improve customer experience . As part of this journey the customer wanted to test the waters by taking   some of his applications , involving both legacy and third - party applications and explore the processes to   the methods of scrum project management . From the business perspective challenge is to improve the   workflow within the departments to increase overall online sales . The project has been time boxed to be   completed within 12 months based on the outcome the final project decision depends on .      Selection    The client has already invested in certain software and tools based on prior discussions with vendors   and experts . Even though the tools are in place we need to educate the team with necessary processes   and tool implementations so that we can launch the process to wider audience .   In short , the launch is   an experiment to test all the processes starting from Boxing the requirements , the design approach ,   trainings involved and removing the kinks in the process so that the final deployment for all applications   will go through without major hinderances .     Application    To begin with , we have focused on the existing landscape of all applications and how the various   systems are interacting with each other . On analysis have realized that we have a backend system   talking to a middleware system to which all applications are talking to . In the launch the backend is the   one going to be changed and with this the changes trickle down to middleware and all applications .   Since the project is timeboxed and must explore all different tasks , project types and processes , have   identified a representative set of applications from the overall applications from different workstreams .   Once this initial assessment is made have structured the tasks within application projects to meet and   adopt to the scrum project management and arrived at a project timeline such as the various sprint   ceremonies , specific meetings , reviews in an effort to be agile . We had a buy in for this process with the   senior management as this is one of the requirements of the challenge . Following buy - in on the   approach had a training session with our team on the scrum project management . Then we had training   sessions cum workshops with he different workstream selected members to methodology and   structured the various tasks and processes following agile way . In the process we have created various   documents including governance , methodology , processes , workflows .   This has gained the confidence   and clarity from our business stakeholders one of the requirements we are satisfying and answered all   questions regarding prioritization of tasks , process changes and workflows and understanding of the   new process . The tasks of Business stakeholder and stakeholder buy - in was completed in about 4 weeks .     Insight    Applying the launch tool , based on the assumptions made and designed launches to test these   assumptions , our actual results varied from what we have anticipated for all the workstreams . While our   team was more open to the prioritization of tasks following the scrum methodology and tools used ,   some of the workstreams due to their nature of work have to resort to different workflow methodology .    The team along with stakeholders have agreed to incorporate these in the future design launches .    There were additional learnings as to how many meetings were needed to follow up both horizontally   and vertical , some process and workflow changes and improvements were needed which have been 

 documented . These learnings are important and to be incorporated to have a successful roll out of the   entire project and part of design thinking .      Approach    The fact that the customer has already invested in certain software and tools and project being time   boxed makes the design thinking a bit more challenging As mentioned the team has to come up with   innovative ideas to perform the launch to help understand the intricacies in the launch . It is important to   review the learnings and incorporate them in future launch designs . Lessons learnt , progress made ,   should be reflected in each o the launches from previous ones and reach the goals for a complete   solution .

"Life Defining Events 

 In my 18 years of existence , describing the person I am today is an account of all the days I have   lived . Every day brings new challenges and unexpected learning opportunities . It will be difficult   to recall all of the lessons and memories from beyond the line . Some trials , on the other hand ,   are worth remembering . My mother used to tell me that when a human is born , he or she is   like a lump of soft clay that can be molded . You can do whatever you want . You can give   characters and shapes that are one - of - a - kind . The thing , on the other hand , will survive longer if   it is adequately heated . The clay 's purity is ignited by heat . It was a problematic ideology for me   to relate to in the context of real life . For me , the healing process was analogous to life 's   hardships . I 've always thought of hurdles as issues . To be clear , problems are not an issue ; it is a   matter of perspective and how people respond to them . I 've always believed that trials make   you weaker because you fall back and injure yourself every time you hit a brick wall . I did n't   know until one day that I could pull down the brick wall ; all I needed was patience and   determination . Furthermore , it is acceptable if you can not overcome the brick wall ; you must   learn to work around it . 

 Other elements like upbringing , personal preferences , and self - consciousness are all critical in   defining a person . There are times of appreciation , thanks , enjoyment , and pleasures that come   with trials . There have been times when I had made my parents and family proud , like when I   received the <NAME> 's "" best student of the year "" award or simply by graduating from a reputable   college . We need to remind ourselves to remain modest and grateful during times like this . This   is something that both of my parents have . 

 Stress Management and Life Balance . 

 <NAME> 's minds are under a lot of stress as a result of their increasingly hectic lifestyle . Stress is   a mental state of tension brought on by stressful , demanding , or complex conditions . Stress   harms one 's mental stress and mood , as well as physical health . 

 When a person is stressed , cortical is produced into the bloodstream , reducing the digestive ,   reproductive , and immune systems ' optimal functioning . This is why , to maintain one 's mind   and body healthy , stress management is vital . 

 When someone is in a difficult position , stress management is making regular changes to one 's   life using various approaches and strategies . Preventing stress through self - care and relaxation   and managing one 's response to stressful situations when they occur are all part of stress   management . 

 <ADDRESS> is harmful to one 's health . When the human body believes it is in danger , stress is a   survival instinct or response . This is why the sympathetic nervous system activates , raising the   heart rate and releasing the energy hormone adrenaline , which aids in dealing with any   scenario . This is also referred to as the fight - or - flight reaction . 

 The issue arises when a person is constantly stressed and worried or unsure how to deal with   difficult situations . Stress management has become increasingly vital in people 's lives to live a   meaningful life , maintain strong relationships , and avoid negative health repercussions . There   are various stress management models , each with explanations for how to deal with or control   stress . 

 Identifying the sources of stress in one 's ongoing life is the first step in stress management .   While significant stressors such as an unpleasant or poisonous relationship , career changes , or   the process of moving are easy to treat , determining the actual cause of chronic stress can be   difficult . 

 <ADDRESS> and producing mental and physical strain can also generate tension and even illness ,   affecting many aspects of one 's life . Stress management is helpful since it lowers the risk of   heart disease , digestive issues , blood pressure , and various other physical disorders . Stress   management is also beneficial in the treatment of mental illnesses such as anxiety and panic   disorder . 

 Several methods reduce stress in one 's life , ranging from meditation to exercise to journaling .   Yoga is a well - known physical stress - reduction strategy . A jog and other forms of cardio   workouts help the body release pleasant hormones called endorphins . 

 Implications for my Leadership Performance and Style 

 Organizational success and leadership have a direct cause - and - effect relationship . Values ,   culture , change tolerance , and employee motivation are all determined by leaders . They   influence institutional initiatives , including how they are implemented and how effective they   are . Leaders can be found at any given level of an organization , not just in management .   Successful leaders , on the other hand , share one trait . They exert influence over others around   them to get the most out of the organization 's resources , particularly its most valuable and   costly asset : its people . Libraries , like businesses , governments , and non - profits , require   leadership . In reality , leaders ' influence and efficacy in bringing people together around a   common goal can directly impact the library 's people , materials , and how patrons utilize or 

 interact with them , as well as whether or not that experience is positive . Given the importance   of leadership in the success of information centers and patron experiences , it 's worth thinking   about the many sorts of leaders and their potential impact on libraries as organizations . 

 My distinctive leadership competencies 

 Leadership abilities are defined as an individual 's capacity and strength to achieve goals by   supervising processes , guiding initiatives , and managing workers . Taking intelligent decisions ,   allocating resources , and delegating , motivating , and communicating effectively are all valuable   leadership characteristics . Honesty , confidence , devotion , and innovation are some of the other   leadership qualities . In an organization , leadership competencies can be utilized to choose ,   develop , and promote leaders effectively . The distinction between leadership skill and   leadership competency may be stated as follows : skill is the required level of efficiency to   complete a task set , whereas competency is the quality to achieve the same . Certain aspects ,   such as corporate strategies and future trends , are considered when developing leadership   capabilities . HR practitioners should leverage business strategies to drive the use of   competencies in choosing and developing leaders . The firm will maintain a competitive   advantage if it can effectively create a distinctive set of talents for its leaders . A project   manager 's job has always piqued my curiosity .

"Visualization Challenge & Selection        The tool I chose to use is storytelling because in my opinion people feel more connected   to stories other than anything . And especially the topic I chose story telling is effective other   than anything else . 

 Application 

 I started to interview different people and observe people in my area . I interviewed localists   and some shopkeepers and some of their customers . I told them about my topic and asked for   their opinions .    Insight & Approach 

 What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the opinions –   especially the revised public opinion that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve ; the more valuable aspect of the activity is the   shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem spaces . 

 I am sharing a story of a shop owner whom I interviewed he runs a business of Chemical fertilizers . 

 He does n’t have that much of expanded business . What his opinion was people do n’t want to pay a   rupee more basically they want things at cheaper costs . He told his customers about the made in <ADDRESS>   products and their pros and cons . Some of his customers denied him for buying alternatives because of   its higher costs . But some of them got ready to buy the alternatives . But after the clash on <NAME>   border majority of his customers buys alternatives even without telling . The surprising thing for me was   that the owner was facing loss still he was promoting alternatives . And people became aware about   what products are they purchasing . I believe if we can boycott made in <ADDRESS> products it is a chance for   us to enter in a global market as a worthy and strong opponent of <ADDRESS> .

"Re - design our Access2Funding Service – Mind Mapping tool 

 Challenge 

 I am currently enrolled as Startup Programs Expert in a University of Saint Francis based in <ADDRESS> . My job consists in   monitoring the evolution of our portfolio through the analysis of the business potential of each project and   the measurement of the effectiveness and quality of our service offering .   Few months ago , I was facing relevant problems concerning the Access2Funding proposition : the service   conceived to help and support incubated startups in the fundraising activities . Despite the importance and   the relevance of capital to our clients , the performances of our service were very disappointing : the rate of   adoption had never succeeded the 10 % of our entire portfolio since the launch of the service itself , and the   customer churn rate had been dangerously high ( meaning that almost nobody renewed the subscription of   the service after the first year ) . It was time for us to face the reality and to understand what was the sources   of this tremendous mismatching between our offering and our clients . 

 Selection 

 We started our re - design process taking a look at the current reality ( e.g. the incubated startups ): our team   conducted informal interviews ( “ coffee sessions ” , we called them ) with a representative subset of our   portfolio trying to understand in a better way all the challenges and the problems faced by our clients before   during and after their fundraising campaigns . We focused our attention exclusively to the “ problem - side ”   ( “ What - is ” ) and we mentioned our service only with our former subscribers to find out the pros and cons of   their experience with the Access2Funding team . After 3 - weeks sessions ( and too much coffees ) we had   amassed a huge amount of data and we needed a tool to distill all the information gathered into patterns   and insights , defining the design criteria of our new Access2Funding service . We decided to go with the <NAME>   mapping tool , rejecting the classic PowerPoint presentation . 

 Application 

 We booked our biggest conference room for an entire afternoon and we invited three different kind of   stakeholders to join our session : the whole Access2Funding team , some of the previously interviewed   startups , Venture Capitalists and Business Angels ( for a total of 12 people involved ) . We posted on the walls   a synthesis of our interviews in order to explain and remind them the problem and the design challenges , we   gave them approximately 30 minutes to observe the data , in silence , and then we asked them to organize   themselves in 3 “ Discussion Groups ” made of 4 people each ( diversity of the members of each group was   guaranteed by us ) . Every Discussion Group had a clipboard and some sticky notes they used to share their   opinions and group them into themed clusters on their clipboard . The second part of the session was then   dedicated to the sharing of the works done by each group , giving the possibility to every group to add and   comment the sticky notes of the others . At the end of the session I personally reviewed in front of the   audience the 3 clipboards collected , summing up in large orange sticky notes the insights and patterns of the   clusters identified by the participants . 

 Insight 

 The results of the Mind Mapping session were simply eye - opener and allowed us to rethink from scratch the   whole Access2Funding value proposition , starting from the role that incubator should have in the fundraising   activities of its startups . We were convinced that the incubator , and the Access2Funding team in particular ,   had to play a role similar to the consultant ’s one , supporting side - by - side the startup team in structuring the   materials and the documents needed to its fundraising campaign , reviewing the business strategy ( if needed ) ,   estimating the right financing need and choosing the typology of capital to raise ( equity , grant or debt ) . On   the contrary , <NAME> <NAME> revealed us a reality that was pretty different : our startups want to be   “ independent ” during fundraising activities . Our Entrepreneurs want to have full control and continuous 

 visibility on the strategy of the companies they run , and due to the strategic impacts of fundraising choices ,   they are not willing to externalise these kind of activities to third parties ( incubators included ) , preferring to   learn on their own the notions of finance they need , being autonomous in such decisions ( quality that is very   appreciated also by investors ) . On the other hand , the session conducted , revealed us some uncovered needs   about our clients that we were not able to identify in the past : the incubator should focus on providing basic   training about finance and accounting to the incubated startups and instead of the consulting role , the   incubator should leverage on its vast network to support the startups through the exploration of the funds ,   corporates or business angels potentially interested in financing the project , speeding up the whole process . 

 Approach 

 Going back in time , I would diversify the dataset of the what - is phase , integrating the information coming   from customer interviews with visual tools and some formal quantitative data . Anyway , <NAME> <NAME> is   really a great tool to align the organization around a common understanding of the current reality , helping   us removing our own bias and approaching the world through the eyes of the customer . Now that we have   successfully identified the insight and pains of our customers , we now possess the right criteria to start re- designing the Access2Funding service .

"<NAME> <NAME> – Design Thinking for Innovation 

 Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 My challenge that I have selected is setting up my own company ! After many years of being a CEO of an   Economic Development organization I have decided that I will open my own company . 

 Selection 

 I have selected the Visualization tool , to achieve an understanding of the opportunity and problems for   myself as well as a reference group to identify and define viable solutions to the opportunity . I also have   selected this so I can use a diagram to visually see all the components in the process of defining the   scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain   points and opportunities . 

 Application 

 I used this approach with myself first to start the process by creating a straw man graphic ( like a mind   map ) to do a brain dump of all the components of the opportunity . To develop the straw man graphic , I   will draw from any existing material and experiences that I may have available to understand the   environment . 

 There is supporting material to assist in this process such as <NAME> <NAME> ‘ visualization techniques to   manifest your desired outcomes ’ to assist in the process . The template I often start with also has a   column on the left to identify Partners and Collaborators and a column on the right to identify Threats   such as competitors , Industrial relations constraints etc . After I complete this I will then undertake the   same type of process with my reference group . 

 After the group looks over the whole idea I will then look to break up the group to work on the   independent idea ‘ clusters ’ that have developed for a deeper dive into the areas that have been   articulated . I will ask each group to use questions such as 1 ) What key elements are missing ? And , 2 )   What would you change ? Then I have each group report out on their answers and explain why for the   rest of the group to understand the logic . This feedback and different ways of looking at the opportunity   would create a process and map that is ‘ market tested ’ . 

 <NAME> <NAME> – Design Thinking for Innovation 

 Insight & Approach 

 I think it is very important for the group to be in an environment that is non - threatening and very open   to different ideas and perspectives . It is also important for each of the stakeholders and groups to have   a chance to express their opinions and receive positive feedback and suggestions in a group   environment . 

 This approach that is very visual as well gives a plan that can be updated and changed with additional   information and ideas . This can occur throughout and at the end of the process and also gives way to   open ideas being expressed . 

 This approach I feel would be helpful at any stage of a project to ‘ market test ’ and ground truth the   projects direction . I would definitely think that the open nature and ease of this process is very inclusive   and is valuable to all businesses as a tool that adds a lot of value and buy - in !

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 Spare parts are fundamental to maintaining the availability of production trucks in the mining   industries . Unfortunately , sourcing in remote areas of <ADDRESS> often remains difficult . Indeed , parts   must be ordered and then transported through a long supply chain where delivery time is often to   the detriment of the requesters . Even worse , if the right part is not delivered , the entire production   schedule often has to be revised . 

 As a supplier of spare parts , mainly serving mining companies in the West African zone , I have an IT   platform that centralizes my spare parts servicing activity . My challenge is to create a simple   technology that buyers from different companies can easily access considering that most mining   companies operate in remote areas with limited access to Internet services . This project includes the   IT staff , as well as the purchasers and the method preparers of the SOMA partner company 's engine   maintenance services . 

 The project is managed by volunteer time on a schedule of no more than 10 weeks for our   development team to deliver a prototype software solution . Our partners from the mining company   SOMA will help us structure the first prototype of the technology so that we can test it with our main   users . 

 Once the prototype has been developed , our technical sales team will conduct the first marketing   study . 

 Selection 

 After consultation , our team decided to use the learning launch tool . The idea was to develop an   effective , yet simple - to - use technology to make it easier for users to test searches . In collaboration   with method preparers and SOMA buyers , we conducted several conceptual thinking activities and   developed a software prototype that will help us go through an iterative process that will allow us to   improve our solution idea with teams from other mining companies in the sub - region . 

 Application 

 Our first launch was to introduce a web application , available through the internet to allow all   customers to connect to it from anywhere in the world . This application presented functionalities   allowing to search for spare parts from references and providing synoptic and functional diagrams of   the different parts . The aim was to ensure that by using part numbers to search information in a   database previously supplied by the parts manufacturers , operators would now order the right spare   parts . But after a long observation , we realized that : 

 - Firstly , the cost aspect was missing , which was of great interest to buyers in order to align with   budgets . 

 - Secondly , most customers would have difficulty using the platform because of their geographical   location , which limited or required them to have an internet connection due to their location . 

 We spent the next 3 days with our project team to improve our prototype by integrating the cost of   parts into it . We worked on several alternatives and finally decided to use a web application ,   available from DVDs that could be used offline on desktops . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning tool , we have designed and tested our solutions . Thanks to this process , we   were able to improve our web application to meet user expectations . This process showed us that   our method preparers and buyers were more comfortable with the second web application . Our   technical sales department used the test results to review our strategic direction . In the future , our   company will adopt similar approaches to offering products and services . 

 Approach 

 The learning launch is the right tool for our company . As a team , we need to review the knowledge   gained from our initial launches and integrate this information into future launch designs . This allows   us to effectively address and highlight solutions . In the future , launch designs will project themselves   through the knowledge highlighted , as well as the progress made to get closer to a convincing out - of- the - box solution .

"Visualization is about using images . It ’s not about drawing ; it ’s about visual thinking . It   pushes us beyond using words or language alone . It is a way of unlocking a different part   of our brains that allows us to think nonverbally and that managers might not normally   use . 

 Journey mapping ( or experience mapping ) is an ethnographic research method that   focuses on tracing the customer ’s “ journey ” as he or she interacts with an organization   while in the process of receiving a service , with special attention to emotional highs and   lows . Experience mapping is used with the objective of identifying needs that customers   are often unable to articulate 

 Mind mapping is used to represent how ideas or other items are linked to a central idea   and to each other . Mind maps are used to generate , visualize , structure and classify   ideas to look for patterns and insights that provide key design criteria . We do this by   displaying the data and asking people to cluster them in ways that allow themes and   patterns to emerge . To succeed , mind mapping must be a team sport . 

 Rapid prototyping techniques allow us to make abstract new ideas tangible to potential   partners and customers . These include storyboarding , user scenarios , experience   journeys and business concept illustrations — all of which encourage deep involvement   by important stakeholders to provide feedback .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool that I used was the tool of <NAME> . As a college student who do n’t have any   working experience , I find that <NAME> is the most familiar tool for me . I often use this   approach to introduce my idea related to the discussed lesson in the class . Usually , I use this   approach especially when I have to do a presentation in front of the class . It ’s because the   presentation material usually is a new material that I need to tell the other friends and I have to   make them understand about what I talked about . So , I prefer to use a storytelling tool because   storytelling allow us to deliver the material in an easier way . Besides that as we know that   storytelling allows us to create energy , passion , and excitement around something & allows us   to make strategy accessible . 

 Application 

 So , my story about storytelling is when I have to present my business idea in front of my lecture   and the expert . My lecture suggested us to deliver our business idea in a storytelling style . So ,   my friends and I start to make the PPT as simple and fun as possible , and we try to not put too   much text in it . So , when the day came , my friends and I started to present our business idea in   front of the lecture , expert , and our classmates . We started the story about the background of   our business idea , we told them that there were so many people who have difficulty in finding   gifts for their relatives . We even share our own stories , such as when we have difficulties to   find present for our friend ’s birthday . 

 Insight & Approach 

 After we ended our presentation , the expert told us that at that time he realized that surely there   were so many people who experience it , the difficulty to find gifts . He also said that our story   was really relate to him because he also had experience it before . And finally , he said that our   business idea is quite good to be developed and of course it ’s still needs some improvement   but overall , he said that our business idea is really relatable and make sense . 

 By studying this course , I realize that there are so many ways for us to discover and develop   our idea . And honestly , I did n’t know that storytelling could be an approach to deliver our idea   before , but because of this course I know it now . I think that in the next opportunity I would   still use this approach and practicing more to make it perfect and it ’s not impossible that I want   to try other approach such like visualization or may be mind mapping because I think both of   them are really worth to try .

"1 . My Three Key Learnings from Design Thinking : 

 •   Empathy : Empathy can be a useful way of solving problems . Listening to people and what they   have to say goes a long way . 

 •   Ideate : Brainstorming about ideas and thinking about them from a different perspective gives   you a real insight . 

 •   Do n’t be afraid to fail : Failure makes you go on a different path and makes you doubt your ideas 

 2 . My Mind Map : 

 3 .   Reflection on how to apply Design Thinking to my workplace :   Design Thinking gave me insights on   how to make those sessions more fruitful . We had a brainstorm meeting during my second week of   taking this class . I told everyone to stand up and use post - it notes to make mind maps and help us with   our ideas . And it worked ! Standing provides a more interactive environment than sitting and writing ideas   on a whiteboard made sessions more productive 

 4 . Insight : Design Thinking made me want to share the ideas I learned in the course and how I could apply   it to improve our problem - solving processes . While we do already think of creative solutions for   problems , forming ideas , making prototypes etc help a lot in solving challenges . 

 Here is my list of <ADDRESS> : 

 •   Share my findings with colleagues . 

 •    Give a talk during a staff meeting about each of the steps in Design Thinking . 

 •   Interview readers to find out what they like and do n’t like . 

 •    Make sketches for more prototypes . 

 5 . Here are my ideas that I would further prototype and test : 

 •    Share my learnings with colleagues . At the end of our weekly production meeting , I could go   over one of each area that I learned about . 

 •    Make a list or write a summary of how to make brainstorming meetings more productive and   share it with the entire Marketing Division in one of our monthly meetings .

"Reflection - Story Telling 

 Challenge & Selection     Story telling is one of the most commonly used tools by me in my daily work as I am leading   the Tech Innovation & Analytics function for our APAC office .       On my daily job , I need to spend half of the time exploring with external tech start - ups and   incubators to source the latest technologies while the other half of the time engaging the   internal stakeholders to look for “ proof of concept ” opportunities to drive digital   transformation . Therefore , it is always a challenge for me to attract competitive or popular   startups to run a pilot with us while same time convincing my internal stakeholders such as   marketing and sales to come forward to invest time and funding resources to test a potentially   scalable innovation solution that could help uplift the business value .      And I find story telling extremally powerful and effective when it comes to pulling the   external tech startups / incubators and my internal business stakeholders to join forces to test   out new creative ideas or solutions .      Application     Here is one recent example of how I applied storytelling to unite external tech startups and   my internal business functions to join force in testing new innovative “ proof of concept ”   project that is named AI On - Demand Video Interview Evaluation .   Initially , I identified this   tech company that has the video AI interview evaluation capability , then I went into my   monthly catch - up meeting with our regional people VP , sharing with her the story of how   Uniliever has successfully transformed their recruitment process by applying AI technology   and removing biases to candidates which has received very positive employee branding effect   as well as a very attractive ROI of the project . That story has around interest by my people   VP on the topic of how AI could help her digitize her recruitment process to the next level ,   knowing her as a very ambitious and competitive leader . With her confirming her interest in   talking to this tech vendor , I reached out to the AI tech vendor to give their sales team a story   of how my people VP has successfully led her last digital transformation in employee self- service platform that led to the global adoption of that vendor ’s solution which has sparked   the interest in working with us to run a pilot .      With my story telling , my people VP and the AI tech company soon entered into a 1 - year   pilot contract that has eventually led to a big success and this year , we are moving into   <NAME> of the pilot to scale up to rest of the APAC office .        Insight & Approach     Therefore , we could see that story telling sometimes is even more powerful than hard sales   pitches or advertisements to unite people from different walks of areas at work and get the   desired outcome .      As a result of the successful pilot I led of the AI interview evaluation in APAC , I went on to   share the successful story to my global team in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> about how the adoption of this   cutting edged AI technology has helped our APAC offices transformed our recruitment 

 process and improve process efficiency which is also a common pinpoint in our north   <ADDRESS> office and they were surprised that there is such a great tech company from the US   that has delivered such a great project and they were n’t even aware of it .   Eventually , through   another story telling back to the vendor , they managed to sign another deal with our <ADDRESS>   office to scale up the solution we built from APAC and the project is still scaling as I wrote   this reflection .      As a digital innovation and transformation leader , I will continue to apply the story telling   skill not just at my work but beyond to benefit those whom I encounter in my life .

"Improving Customer Experience for SME Customers     Challenge     I work for a telco Company and one of the main problems is customer satisfaction , even   more for small enterprise customers ; for years Customers Satisfaction Index ( CSI ) and   Net Promoter Scores ( NPS ) have been the lowers numbers not only of the company but   also of the market , CSI=6.36 and NPS = -27 % ; so we have the assignment to level up   those numbers for the next two years . The customer experience team was composed   for young executives with a lot of energy but lack of experience about legacies and   company culture so any idea bumps over the walls constantly .     Selection     To accomplish these assignment we must form a multiarea team and make a   sensibilization job in order to made understand all of them that the focus of everything   in the company is the customer and to make this clear we use <NAME> <NAME> ,   because in a graphic mode they can not only understand better the problem but most   important make all of them participate and collaborate providing their experience and   ideas about how the company works and more important how the customers feel about   the service .     Application     We draw all the costumer journeys and the moments of truth when this teams are   involved in their daily shores . It was interesting how team members start to discover the   importance of all the things they normally and how that impact on the customers , they   never realized that any task that they deliver incomplete for any reason starts a snow   ball that finally reach the customers as an avalanche .     Insight     As a result of using these tool the team not only discover problems they discover that   working together they can make the job of everyone easier and finally make happy   customers ; more important , once they have every customer journey draw in the wall   they could bring a lot of different ideas about how improve some process , also identified   some task that were no longer necessary to do and others that have to be deliver for a   different area so they were able to optimize their own processes .     Approach     Visualization tools helped us a lot as a first step in order to improve customer experience   by knowing what is going on inside the company that make us deliver and inefficient   service , now we have to implement those ideas , the better ones , and so we decided to   use the learning launch tool to start , in a fast way , deploy improvements in our call 

 center for example , using a group of agents for experiment with new channels of   attention using AI ( chatbots ) and a new front end with <NAME> .

"A new library management system 

 In 1999 , with a 12 year - old system running on a 386 server , Horowhenua Library Trust ( HLT )   needed to replace our library management system ( LMS ) . We followed the usual Request For   <NAME> ( RFP ) process , and after reading a staggering amount of papers , found we were not   satisfied with any of the options . There were systems available that would over - deliver at a cost we   could n’t afford , systems which we could afford but did n’t meet our needs , and all of the systems had   much more expensive communications solutions than we had been using . Plus , none of them used   a web browser interface . 

 We engaged Katipo Communications to develop a web - based LMS for us , and they suggested it be   released under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) as a way to ensure the project had longevity   ( they did n’t necessarily want to spend the rest of their days supporting a proprietary system ) and this   would encourage other people to use it — improving and enhancing it along the way . The GPL would   also ensure that subsequent modifications and additions by other organisations were open source   as well , benefitting all users . 

 While "" shareware "" and "" freeware "" have been available since the earliest days of computing , open   source software had developed in the years leading up to 2000 on a different scale entirely . It was   no longer confined to the realm of "" hobby "" programmes . Open source projects were starting to   produce software that matched or exceeded the quality of commercial products at the time , and   <NAME> was starting to challenge Windows in very large - scale projects . 

 Librarians and FOSS 

 Librarians and free and open source software have lots in common . They both : 

 •   believe that information should be freely accessible to everyone 

 •   benefit from the generosity of others 

 •   are about communities 

 However , working with free and open source is a very different way of working for librarians who are   traditionally more comfortable in a co - dependent relationship with vendors . A significant mind - shift is   required in order to maximise value from open source . 

 It is NOT about accepting what you are given but articulating what you want . Librarians need to   develop new skills in order to interact or participate fully in the community that is the heart of open   source projects . 

 Open source community 

 Open source projects only survive if a community builds up around the product to ensure its   continual improvement . <NAME> is stronger than ever now because it is supported by an active   community of developers , librarians and vendors — who actually talk to each other ! 

 Each partner has a role to play in a successful open source community : 

 Librarians and the patrons or end users whose interests they represent are the ultimate judges as   to whether or not a product or service is desirable , and they define a product or vendor ’s success . 

 Developers who create the code and tools . 

 Vendors filter ideas and bring only the viable , potentially profitable , and sustainable options to   market . 

 My keynote address at ComicCon11 in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> explored this community of partnerships and how   crucial it is that the interactions between each is balanced . 

 Vendors and libraries 

 When the relationship is in perfect balance the relationship thrives ; vendors get excellent input and   feedback on feature development , exhaustive usability testing for design and function , and   truckloads of free promotion . However , if the desire to have a congenial working relationship   dominates over sound business decisions , development stops being financially viable and economic   sustainability is lost . On the flip side , if short - sighted business decisions override the needs and   wants of the library , including the open source philosophy , we get into trouble as well . 

 Developers and libraries 

 When it works well , we get speedy development of solutions that do the job . A reality check informs   technical development ; developers do n’t just develop something because it sounds cool but because   it ’s a ‘ good ’ solution to an existing problem or will add value . When it gets out of harmony , we risk   getting bad features developed at the initiative of either the library or the developers . Libraries may   request really useful features but developers may not want to incorporate them , or too many bells   and whistles could get developed , sacrificing function over gizmos . 

 Vendors and developers 

 Many businesses fall into the trap of focusing most of their energy in the business side ( cost savings ,   process improvements , efficiencies , quality control ) instead of taking the time to focus on the people   and relationships . When pure business goals start driving development we get bad stuff happening   due to corporate greed , but when we get the balance right we get high quality , innovative , viable ,   rapid , and sustainable development . 

 Take a holistic view 

 While each of the relationships between the partners are important the holistic view is even more   important . It is really important that librarians are actively involved and do n’t just leave development   to the developers and vendors . We need to keep in mind the end user who we serve . For example , if   you ask : "" Do these new bells and whistles help the people accomplish something or do they just get   in the way ? "" it helps you avoid the "" just because you can "" syndrome . 

 Linus Torvalds in an interview by <NAME> <NAME> - <NAME> for a Hewlett - Packard publication had this   to say about software development : 

 The other thing ... that people seem to get wrong is to think that the code they write is what matters   ... No , even if you wrote 100 % of the code , and even if you are the best programmer in the world and   will never need any help with the project at all , the thing that really matters is the users of the code .   The code itself is unimportant ; the project is only as useful as people actually find it . "" 

 Moving to open source was philosophically a good fit for Horowhenua Library Trust . It has also been   a good financial and practical decision . But most importantly it helps us to put the end user , our   patrons and the people we serve , at the heart of decisions we make as an organisation .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The primary apparatus I utilized was the instrument of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to   accomplish a common comprehension of an issue space among a different gathering of partners   before endeavoring to recognize and characterize potential answers for the issue . I utilize this   methodology frequently with our clients , who are government organizations attempting to apply   innovation developments to modernize their strategic the conveyance of their administrations to   their client , which might be <ADDRESS> residents , organizations , and non - residents . I have utilized the   method of utilizing a misrepresentation representation of an issue space with a lot of inquiries or   prompts for conversation to permit an assorted gathering of partners to gain from one another   during the time spent characterizing the degree , limits , key components , and connections between   components to consider whenever recognizing torment focuses and open doors for upgrades or   arrangements . 

 Application 

 I start the procedure by making a misrepresentation realistic of the difficult space . To build up the   misrepresentation realistic , I will draw from any current material accessible to comprehend nature .   The current material might be operational or procedural records , preparing materials , showcasing   materials , GAO or other examining reports . On the off chance that materials are not accessible , at   that point I lead casual meetings with one - three of the partners who fill in as my primary concerns of   contact on the activity . 

 On the off chance that proper to the circumstance , I will obtain the idea to "" front - stage / back - stage ""   from past exploration , and examined in <NAME> <NAME> 's book , "" The Connected Company "" . The front- stage / back - stage approach assists with strengthening the idea that each help – even an interior   assistance – has clients with whom the specialist organization cooperates and inside procedures that   empower the association to offer the support . The layout I regularly start with likewise has a section   on the left to recognize Partners and Value Chain Providers and a segment on the option to   distinguish Oversight Organizations , for example , Congress , GAO , trade guilds , support gatherings ,   and different elements that may add limitations to how the association works . The   misrepresentation realistic is basic , utilizing straightforward shapes and symbols accessible in <NAME>   or on the Internet . In the event that the front - stage / back - stage see does n't work , at that point I will   make an alternate kind of visual , either dependent on a significant level procedure stream with swim   paths for various partners , or another configuration . 

 For the action , I will separate the partners into gatherings of 5 - 6 members each speaking to an   alternate association or region of intrigue . Each gathering gets a banner size duplicate of the   misrepresentation realistic that they can compose on straightforwardly , or utilize clingy notes to   offer remarks . I offer them two - three inquiries to response , for example , 1 ) What key components   are absent from the realistic ? 2 ) What might you change about the realistic to make it all the more   precisely mirror your difficult space ? 3 ) What key experiences do you have about the connections   between the substances in your difficult space ? I give them around 20 minutes to talk about the   inquiries and increase the realistic . At that point I have each gathering report out on their responses   to those three inquiries while highlighting the imprint ups on their banner . As each gathering reports   out , I record shared traits in the bits of knowledge of each gathering , and afterward extra 

 experiences that originate from the gathering conversation on an extra duplicate of the realistic .   After the meeting , I digitize each gathering 's banner as an ancient rarity , make a view that joins the   common and new bits of knowledge from the gathering conversation , and afterward make an   amended realistic that fuses their criticism and proposed changes that they consented to as a   gathering . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What I have gained from directing this activity with a few gatherings is that while the realistic –   particularly the modified realistic that fuses their input – is significant for fortifying their   comprehension of the difficult they are attempting to illuminate , the more important part of the   movement is the common bits of knowledge and shared discovering that happens while they are   attempting to characterize their difficult space . The realistic gives the various gathering of partners a   point of convergence for conversation that permits them to share their viewpoints and form bits of   knowledge into potential main drivers of their issues . While they could make the realistic from a   clear record in a shared way , beginning with a misrepresentation kicks off the discussion for them .   They can rapidly recognize where they are in the realistic – or on the off chance that they are missing   – and can all the more rapidly increase new bits of knowledge about connections between key   elements as opposed to setting aside effort to distinguish them . They can likewise recognize factors   in the difficult space – that is , it encourages them to distinguish what they do n't have the foggiest   idea , in what zones they have to get data or information to give the qualities to the factors . 

 Since I found that the most significant angle is the mutual bits of knowledge and learning , next time I   would utilize the perception movement as a beginning stage for a progression of configuration   thinking exercises . At that point the changed realistic that consolidates their joined input can fill in as   a source of perspective apparatus all through the rest of their work .

"Reflection 

 Challenge 

 As a member of quality department , one of the most important activities is 

 reduce loses and helps to produce parts with   the best possible standards to satisfy   final customers and reassurance the company image though all value chain . To reach   this goal , it is important that all product characteristics has standards knowing by   production employees . After define the quality requirements with customers after   evaluate parts with defects , the information needed to be shared with employees   responsible for process and production to correct fails and supply parts according to   customers ’s expectations . 

 Selection 

 I decided to use visualization tool to improve the knowledge of standard parts 

 between production employees who are responsible to approve the final product   because it is a way to set up standards with all team envolved . 

 Application 

 .   I put some desks with good quality standard parts to be used as example in 

 final products approval process and used images with the most commons defects to   help in detection . 

 Insight 

 The visualization process makes easier to understand the most common 

 problems inside the production process and helps to identify ways to avoid them ,   change the machines parameters . Besides , reinforces quality importance . 

 Approach 

 In new project delevopment , establishes quality standards with customers 

 during try - out phases and first supplied batches and adjust process continuously to   reduce loses and parts with defects .

"Challenge 

 I am a member of my organization ’s online marketing department and our challenge is to improve the   workflow or a product within the company in order to increase sales in the online channel and to spend   marketing budgets on the right campaigns . 

 The project/ product scope online application and interactive website for the insurance company   includes the online marketing department composed of 4 employees , hat needs to deal with larger   department and IT department , with whom we work closely . The project is limited to internal resources   ( i.e. , budget and employee time ) . The project should not exceed 15 days and the solution should include   an even distribution of working hours amongst the team members . We will focus on trying to uncover   what our team members , as well as key stakeholders within the larger marketing department and IT   department , consider to be ineffective or problematic about the workflow . 

 Selection 

 Our team has already gone through several design thinking activities and sessions , so we are ready to   try the launch of the website and application .   the application launch is an experiment meant to test an   idea and service of a new feature integration . 

 Application 

 For our first application launch , we focused on the execution of our online marketing tasks .   we wanted   to see if we could structure our tasks , projects , and processes to adapt the methods of other project   management for our work ( time , daily , other projects and requests ) 

 to become more flexible . the structure and execution were the main causes of our workflow challenge . 

 Our team went through a training program with a project management and time management solution   for projects . 

 Next , we went through workshops to structure our duties and processes in a more managed way . These   two sessions occurred within in a a short timeslot 

 . We expected to produce a document with a clear description of our new , application and website   processes / workflow . 

 For our second website launch , we focused on clarity about our tasks and priorities and what features   should we start with . prioritization of tasks was the main cause of our workflow challenge . 

 Our team completed several meetings and survey . Additionally , stakeholders from the larger   department and IT department also did workshops . The surveys included questions about our new ,   features , understanding the process and the prioritization of tasks , and feelings about the change , and   were conducted within the timeframe . 

 Insight 

 By applying the launch , our department identified our process and designed launches to test these   features . also , we thought through anticipated results , expecting to find that a more acceptable   approach would improve our workflow and to add more features , and that both our team and the key   stakeholders would be open to the new prioritization of tasks and process . 

 Our actual results were slightly different from what we anticipated : while our team was open to the   prioritization of tasks and process , the key stakeholders in the larger marketing department and IT   department expressed some concerns . then , our team review this insight and incorporate it into future   feature designs . The ongoing incorporation of insight is particularly important at this stage , as launches   come before a full rollout in the design thinking timeframe . 

 <NAME> 

 Given that our team has already gone through several design thinking activities / tools and at this stage   in the timeframe , the learning launch is the appropriate tool . As previously mentioned , our team needs   to review the insight gained from previous launches and incorporate this insight into future launch   designs . Future launch designs should include   insight gained , progress made , and come closer to a   compelling solution and features ready for the public .

"Visualization 

 Challenge : 

 I work for a public sector agency responsible for issuing and managing licenses for over a   million active license holders . There are at any point in time with over 100 K applicants applying 

 for new licenses annually across 250 different license categories . 

 One of the strategic goals identified was to improve time it takes to issues new professional 

 licenses in the State . Before we could improve , we needed to understand what it took issue   licenses today . Based on initial analysis it took anywhere between 3 days – 60 days to issues 

 licenses based on the type and circumstance the licensee were involved . 

 The end - to - end process of a licensing was not documented or understood among all   stakeholders ; There was some data available that was not accurate or unlikely to help us   determine the time needed for licensing . A myriad of systems and paper forms was used to   capture data throughout the life cycle of a licensing process . 

 Selection : 

 It was clear that the problem we have to first solve is to understand and define the customer   journey through the process of getting a license from the State before we could agree on how to   calculate the length of time it takes to acquire a license . Stakeholders included customer ,   testing entities , law enforcement , reviewers , inspectors , lawyers , IT , and associations   representing each license groups . The tool we selected was journey mapping to detail the 

 customer interactions with various stakeholders and systems . 

 One of the benefits of customer journey mapping is that it will help us to pick out where we may   be falling short , and where silos exist within our process . We believed that viewing the journey   from the lens of the customers gives us the ability to pinpoint any areas where we may be   missing interaction point . 

 Application : 

 We brought together a team representing the various stakeholders involved in the process . 

 Created a baseline flow of customer experience as a large poster and displayed it the   conference room for team to consume . We also provided post - it notes to users so they can   add their comments and notes about the process . Scheduled sessions where teams would   get to gather and place their notes on the workflow . The next several sessions each note   was discussed and either added to workflow , discarded , or combined with similar comments 

 from others . 

 Using a simple tool like post - it notes help us move notes around as discussions proceeded   and allowed users to create new notes as the discussion happened . There were few times   when we discovered a key piece of information that changed the process , we had to retrace   our path through the process . 

 Insight : 

 The tool highlighted the collective lack of understanding of customer ’s experience . It was 

 clear the number of assumptions made by various stakeholders on how and what the   customer did during each phase . Going through this has given us information and ideas that   would take us using other design thinking tools like brainstorming , concept development ,   customer co - creation and learning launch . 

 Approach : 

 Based on the experience that makes sense to use the same tool next time with some   changes to it . By organizing meeting in smaller groups and it makes it efficient to incorporate   feedback and frequently into the model . Organizing feedback better – Use of color 

 coordinated post - it notes to organize suggestions , ideas , and process steps . Better customer   engagement of external customer in the process from the start should help us capture their   perspective .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The one I use most frequently is a visual tool . Visualized presentation often allows groups   with different knowledge and cultural backgrounds to get the exact message that the speaker   intends to convey . I am an interdisciplinary scientist whose research fields include materials   science , electrochemistry and environmental science . Therefore , my research results usually   need to enable readers with different academic backgrounds to quickly obtain the knowledge   and data they need without consulting other materials . In a study on the reprocessing of   waste vegetables for environmental protection , the results of our study need to be elaborated   in combination with studies in the three fields . Therefore , my group chose a visual   experimental process to eliminate misunderstandings that may arise from different fields of   expertise . 

 Application 

 We used a combination of cartoon flow chart and animated diagram to express the process   and main results of the experiment . We named this kind of visualized presentation FCG , which   means the flow chart with GIFs for details .    The part of cartoon flow chart allows readers with different research backgrounds to quickly   find the core points of the research . In this research on materials for the use of waste   vegetables for environmental protection purposes , the cartoon flow chart very briefly   describes the material preparation process and the performance characteristics of the   resulting electrochemical materials . This description is easy to understand for the materials   researcher , and saves the environmental worker and electrochemistry researcher the time to   supplement the material science background for the material preparation process .   In the annotated GIFs section , we use real image shooting and dynamic flowchart nesting to   include the parts that may be of interest to environmental science and materials science   without burdening electrochemistry researchers .   Therefore , FCG structure has been proved to be a very convenient and efficient   communication tool in this research activity . Our research was confirmed by experts in three   fields and successfully summarized for publication 

 Insight & Approach 

 After this study , we believe that Visualization based FCG structures have unexpected   advantages in explaining cross - domain research . Its application is not limited to the three   studies mentioned above . By adjusting the scale and content contained in cartoon flow charts   and GIFs , the FCG process can be adapted to a variety of concise expressions of 

 interdisciplinary research . It is even possible to use cartoonish flowcharts as annotations to   GIFS in turn to accommodate interdisciplinary research biased towards the latter . More   interestingly , we find that this expression seems to be more appropriate for today 's digital   knowledge acquisition . In addition , it is more convenient to introduce some cutting - edge   research that requires rich background knowledge to the public in a popular science way . This   structure can also eliminate the possibility of errors caused by different understandings   between frontier researchers and popular science material makers in a specific experimental   link .   Nowadays , people pay more and more attention to the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge   demand , visualization tools will inevitably have more and more changes in form to adapt to   and solve various problems in the expression and dissemination of knowledge .

"Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 My team and I were challenged to sell an inventory of products that we had no experience with , nor   knowledge of .   We are a team of males who have a small online store .   We were presented an   opportunity to sell an inventory of adult toys for women .   The reason we accepted a challenge in such   an unknown field was the potential financial gains .   We were not required to put down any capital nor   required to provide any storage .   We were obligated to pay back only the cost of the products after the   sales were made , which are sold at roughly a 50 % profit margin .   No deadline was established and there   was very limited capital available for this project . 

 Selection 

 We chose to do a learning launch .   A learning launch is a quick and cheap experiment on an idea in the   real world that allows you to test your assumptions on real customers .   A more in depth explanation can   be found in <NAME> 4 of the course ‘ Design Thinking for Innovation ’ through the University of Virginia . 

 We chose this tool because we needed direct conversations with our customer base .   Instead of   researching articles and analyses of this market and its customers , we wanted to learn directly from   them .   We knew these products were in demand , however we were looking for the most effective way   to get them into the hands of the buyers .   This tool was designed to perfectly meet our goals . 

 Application 

 After researching our new product line , we held a showcase event as our learning launch .   We invited   members of our target customer group , displayed our products and displayed prototypes of potential   versions of an online store .   We raffled prizes and products and had conversations with guests .   We   gathered all the data and feedback from our conversations and questionnaires , took notes and then met   as a team to compile our findings .   The learning launch met all our expectations .   It was quick , easy to   arrange , inexpensive and provided us with a wealth of in - depth intimate information through direct   conversations . 

 Insight 

 This tool was invaluable in meeting our goals .   It set us in a new direction , turning us away from a path   of certain failure that we would otherwise have followed . 

 Assumptions held prior to the learning launch that we expected to confirm : 

 -   We assumed women did not trust or feel comfortable purchasing these products from men 

 -   We assumed an online store would be most effective . 

 -   We assumed we would need to partner with female experts to consult on webpage design and   content 

 Conclusions from the learning launch : 

 -   Customers want to see the physical products and make purchases in person 

 -   Are comfortable purchasing products from men , provided they are knowledgeable 

 -   Are interested in getting male opinions and insight on products and experiences 

 -   Most popular purchasing environment would be a Tupperware style party held by   knowledgeable males 

 These were not results we expected to receive , however it has changed our mindset and pointed us in   the direction of another quick and cheap learning launch , to validate our findings and continue   improving our methods as we move forward . 

 This tool was an effective way to quickly test our assumptions in a market that was unknown to us .   I   believe this is also true of Design Thinking as a whole .    It allows us to organize and make structured   decisions in areas that can be very murky and unknown . 

 Approach 

 I would undoubtedly use the same tool again in the same scenario .   We knew information existed that   we did not possess .   We also knew that our customers possessed this information .   A learning launch   was the best way to quickly and inexpensively make direct contact with these customers .   The only thing   I ( we ) would do differently in the future is to hold more learning launches and hold them more   frequently .

"Visualization Tool – GRC Company 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a manager of a GRC ( Governance , Risks and Compliance ) company , we had a challenge to   change and re - design our brand , due to the following points : to move away from an outdated image ,   separate us from the supplier company of our software ( Nasdaq ) and further humanize the GRC for   the clients , transforming our company as a reference of implementation and support of GRC in <ADDRESS>   <ADDRESS> . 

 The project team defined for this activity was composed of 5 people , including third parties ( a large   re - branding company ) , with whom we worked side by side . The deadline for this change was about   three months , starting from the company 's mission , through manifest and finally the logo .   The stakeholders we dealt with during this challenge were our internal team , clients who had already   contracted our services and potential clients , on a small scale . This was all done with a limited   budget . 

 The selected tool for this challenge was the Visualization tool , due to the need of getting different   views and opinions regarding this re - branding , in understanding where we were positioned and   where we would like to go , with a very graphical view , using shapes , straw man , sticky notes and a   mural of collages . 

 Application 

 With the tool set to start the work of Design Thinking , we all gathered in a great room to brainstorm   with questions relevant to the theme of brand change .   For this , each of the five involved in the process , developed in their notebooks some illustrated   figures , responding in the understanding they had about our company in the market .     After fifteen minutes , we projected these photographs onto a large television so that everyone could   get an idea of what someone else 's cognitive drawn , understanding what our current situation is . In   this way , we complement each other to arrive in our state "" What is "" .     The initial part of the process we could say it was the easiest , since against facts there are not much   of arguments , so we just had to do a little calibration to get common understanding .     The next step was to get the sticky notes and start drawing what we imagined the customer would   like to receive from our system 's benefits in their day to day and how it would feel good to know that   your company was in compliance with all the standards imposed by the government and other   regulatory bodies , and have its risks controlled by an intuitive system , in an easy way . This was   made using flowcharts and figures , to be easily visualized by everyone in the group .     After that , the output was a big set of ideas that we selected a few of them , by get the minimal   agreement from everyone from the participants and the rest of the ideas was sent to the shelf . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The group has learned that with this approach , we were able to elaborate in a much simpler way ,   through drawings , what was inside the mind of each individual in the group . Every human being has   their own cognition and their way of understanding the world , beyond their values , so things that did   not seem so relevant to one , became more important to another . In the end , we all come to a   common understanding , accepting the least feasible for all , that is , we approve as a group . What I   have learned individually is that the importance of listening to various people is that they feel part of   the transformation and resolution of a challenge .     What I understand that could be done differently for the next few times is perhaps to diversify the   group a little more , because although we have different areas involved within this scope , we still   lacked a bit more diversity , to see beyond our day the day .   But the whole process proved to be profitable and being released three months ago , the brand   proved to be disruptive in the market , with a good perception of the market with the slogan "" GRC   New Era "" !

"Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I often use visualizations in my own or group work . This method helps us to better understand   what a person wants to show and how he represents future images . With the help of visualization ,   I can recognize a person , his soaps and ideas . I am an environment designer and at the University   we often work in groups to create a common project . Recently at the lesson we were given the   task to create a museum space and it was necessary to do it in a group . All my colleagues are   creative people and sometimes it is diﬃcult to understand through words what idea or image is   being formed . To solve this problem , I used the method of visualizing thoughts . This approach   includes a research of the future topic , analysis of the idea and sketch of the future project . The   sketch can be made on paper in the form of a drawing or as a 3D design ( any imaginative   approach is an excellent solution ) . In the process , the group clearly demonstrates its train of   thought , gives others the opportunity to learn how to present a project and helps develop visual   culture , which is especially useful for a designer . 

 Application 

 I begin the visualization method with a detailed analysis of the future topic . To do this , you need to   use various Internet resources or books that contain information about the authors , existing   projects , descriptions , etc . Most often I ﬁnd the right material on the art web - sites on the Internet .   These sources are always open , which simpliﬁes the search process . 

 After a general study , I suggest creating "" tags "" for the project . A person writes all the words and   phrases that he associates with the chosen topic . They write down all the words in the form of   tree branches , creating a system that can be linked together in meaning and ﬁnd a new incredible   image for a future project . This serves as a template or basis for the work . Then you can proceed   to the visualization of the received phrases . 

 For our project about museums , we printed out all our ideas , "" tags "" , visualizations and combined   all the best in them into a single whole . The whole group analyzes each work and analyzes what   went well and badly in the project . Sometimes we can immediately cut and connect objects to   each other . So , we have a new project that has gathered all the ideas , ﬁndings and visual part . 

 Insight & Approach     I have worked with several groups using this method and realized that this approach helps to   unite the team , listen to everyone , creates an opportunity for each member of the group to speak   out , this is very important for teamwork . Feedback , discussions and criticism allow you to learn   from mistakes and make the next project better , since the visual part remains with each person in   the form of an artifact . Every time a person wants to remember how he reasoned last time , they   will be able to ﬁnd visualizations and understand what was good and bad in the project . This   develops the visual culture of a creative person and helps in future work . 

 I found that the most important point is the exchange of ideas and the creation of a common   sketch in the group , so next time you can devote the main amount of time to this . Then the   collective work can be used in the future as a model for other groups .

"<NAME> <NAME> <NAME> application in an apparent production problem 

 Challenge 

 Once I worked in a ribbon manufacturer Company . There was a lot of stopped production machines   and only one of them worked 3 - 4 hours each day , some of them had no maintenance . Only   considering the only working machine there was a production problema that i could not see . I needed   to know what was this apparent production problem by alanyzing the different sections of the   Company as a system of inner - clients by the different sub - products each section has to deliver to the   next in order to make the final product . These inner - clients has needs beyond the product by itself   and I wanted to discover them . 

 Selection 

 By using he <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> I should get some information about the needs of each Company   section and start to get to a view to the real problem . I should analyze each section as a persona and   then I should know what was the apparent production problema . 

 Application 

 I met each section idependient from the other and show the product flow of the process . I told them   to write on a post - it the common issues they watched in the sub - product when it arriver to the section   beside as how the product was planed to arrive ( freccuency , quality , etc . ) . This was a complicated   exercise to do with the administrative section because the sub - product they process is intangible . 

 Insight 

 The sub - product to ge tinto each section had usually good quality , but the problem was the quantity .   It had been a low product flow ( compared to the Company competitors and compared to the total   production capacity of the Company itself ) for 20 years . They had a lot of unused machines and a lack   of leadership , a problem to do the activities by the same way as always . I created a “ persona ” for each   section to standarice the way the inner - relations should be . 

 The main issue was located from the top of the Company , the CEO and the administrative section did   not look for more clients and the did n’t have intentions to updathe their marketing 2000 ’s system .   The biggest problem was the CEO ’s lack of leadership . He has been confortable with his Company all   this time and did not want to change anything . There was not an offering to the products that the un- used machines would produce because of the CEO ’s instentions fot not - growing . The administrative   section was the main problem , they proccesed the orders , but did not search for more . The solution is   to inspire and take the lead of a growing - upgrading administrative plan . 

 Approach 

 The use i gave to the Mind Mapping Tool results to me mor informative tan productive . The Tool ’s use   i defined from the beginning was to find the origin of a problem by watching the relation of different   company ’s sections instead of defining a definitive solution . The tool facilitated the road to solve the   ptoblem but not the solution itself . The next time i would make a better definition of the reach of the   tool ’s use from the start .

"Example Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 I am working in the field of management consulting as a consultant and therefore our main   challenge is to improve business activities and processes in order to increase key factors like   sales , total revenue and profit . Our clients usually are from the insurance business and due   to significant changes in this sector , the sustainable improvement of inner - company   processes at all relevant interfaces is a key factor for improving success . The project scope I   am talking about in the following sections includes the claim all department of a big   insurance company . This all department should be totally reorganized . So the main challenge   that we faced was who to structure the new all department in different departments – as   little as possible but so much needed . 

 Selection 

 My team and I started this project by arranging several workshops to go through different   design thinking tools . After analysing several options , we decided that mind mapping could   be a very good option for us so we started to use it as our designing tool for our challenge .   Despite of the other tools , mind mapping is a useful tool for the case where you have a lot of   things to demonstrate and you want to extract your goals from it by focusing directly to the   required things to achieve our goals in most efficient , simplest and practical ways . 

 Application 

 We started our mind mapping by two sessions divided in a week time , stating all scopes   related to sustainability that each member might think of a stick it to our mapping board .   We collected all approaches off the different points of views . At first there are the costumers   which can use different ways who to get in contact with company in case of a claim ( for   example telephone , e - mail , etc . ) . After that we have different insurance divisions . Moreover ,   it can be useful to differ the claim in height . There can be good cases and arguments for   specialists and generalists . After we stated all related topics , we planned 2 days per week   workshops in a three weeks ’ time - period . The aim of these workshops was to connect our   ideas with the different people group ( e.g. customers , employees from the different parts of   the company , etc . ) After this time , we connect all the different maps with a good feeling to   have important inputs . Finally , we ended our mind mapping sessions by looking at where   each member if our team has an interest and in what scope of work each member can do his   best – not only in the project also in the time after for all the people of the claims all   department . 

 Insight 

 The Outcome of this mind mapping tool was having 6 different types , how the new   organisation of the claim all Department could be . We decided that each team consist of 2   members working on this specific type , to find a good reasons and arguments , why their   type should be the new form of the organisations . By applying the mind mapping tool , we   created our mind map that we can follow to structure an achieve the different types . 

 Moreover , it helped us to design different thinking ’s of how the new all department can look   like . We considered a path for each type parallel to what we expected to achieve in it . At this   stage , our team become more familiar with the work that should be carried in the different   groups of employee . 

 Approach 

 The work done for the first 6 weeks starting with illustrating different design thinking tools   and ended by applying a mind mapping as our design thinking tool . Using this tool presented   a great impact in the work that the team carried within the year and resulted in achieving   more than what expected for a short time of period . My team and I will stick to use this tool   for our future work as we founded out that it suits our type of work which includes a lot of   information , charts , graphs and tables that always need to be linked towards having the   promised outcomes . We agreed to follow the mind mapping we already used for our future   tasks and it always must demonstrate the insight within the work , the progress done , and   focus more toward the impact that we are expecting .

"DESIGN TOOL -VISUALISATION 

 CHALLENGE AND SELECTION   Being a high schooler in <ADDRESS> , I realised that none of the schools that I was acquainted   with , included sex education as a part of their curriculum . The thought that millions of   children in my country were unequipped with the knowledge of which situations they had   to be alert in , and which behaviours or actions were considered assault , came as a shock   to me . Therefore , to educate the students in my school , about sexual assault and self   defence through our school ’s “ SCREAM NO ” campaign , my friends and I selected the   tool of visualisation as our core medium . Our use of visualisation corresponded   appropriately with our purpose to demonstrate to the children , the scenarios and actions   that they had to be made aware of , through our theatrical plays and movies . 

 APPLICATION   Our “ SCREAM NO ” campaign was created to emphasise to the students of the age 6 to   12 years ’ , about the diﬀerence between “ GOOD touch ” and “ BAD touch ” . We branched   out our medium of visualisation into three forms — enacting plays , showcasing compiled   scenes from movies and demonstrating self - defence moves .   We began the ﬁrst stage of the campaign where all volunteers would enact situations in   which the child would be able to distinguish if a stranger or an acquaintance of theirs ,   was touching them inappropriately ; and then , act out the possible manners in which they   could respond or react to those actions , one of them attributing to the title itself ,   screaming “ NO ” . Our second stage , was our cinematic session , where we compiled various clips from   movies to showcase certain behaviours and dialogues that could foreshadow assault . To   broaden their awareness on assault and mutual safety ; we made sure they were also   shown scenes where we could debunk actions that were normalised and parodied in   ﬁlms . We explained how the concept of eve - teasing people on the streets was neither   normal , nor encouraged , and how the reactions displayed on screen were n’t   correspondent to reality . Lastly , we taught them some self defence tricks and moves , so that they were physically   capable of protecting themselves in dangerous situations . We then enacted situations   where the volunteers were pretending to be assaulters , so the students could perform   and practice the moves they learnt . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH   We held our campaign over a period of three months , and the results were extraordinary .   We asked the students , after each stage in the entire course of the program , if what we   presented to them was useful or enlightening in any manner . Their responses made my   day . They stated that the plays and movies we showed them , were not only more   entertaining and involving , but they also connected signiﬁcantly more to the visual   aspects of our program than the theoretical parts of it .   Using this approach of visualisation assured that the students and the volunteers were on   the same page at each stage of the campaign , and helped make the concepts of self   defence and the dangers of sexual assault , physically tangible . The students understood   which behaviours they should n’t encourage or normalise and what they should stand for   as individuals .   Through this campaign , I truly saw the impact that visualisation can have on the eﬃciency   of our communication skills , and the increment in our potential to be more persuasive .

"Reflection- Storytelling / Visualization 

 Challenge :     I currently work in a large supply chain organisation and I am responsible for driving the   business   of Apple products ( iPhones and <NAME> <NAME> ) for the Western and <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> of   <ADDRESS> .   My Job entails managing a team of Employees and Distributors to ensure that the   products are made available in General Trade outlets ( Retail Outlets ) and Apple Stores across   my region .   In the past I have spent about 16 years in the Consumer Durable Industry , FMCG   Industry and Life Insurance Industry . I have managed multiple channels of business like Direct   Agency , Business Associate Model , Bancassurance and Direct Marketing Channel within the Life   Insurance Domain .   I would like to reflect upon events in this phase where I was managing   business for a large Global Life Insurance Company .       I had just joined the company in 2003 and was entrusted with Business Development and   setting up branches in two different <ADDRESS> , one in a metropolitan city <ADDRESS> and other   in a town <NAME> in <ADDRESS> .   The Business Associate Model was a newly introduced business   model where unlike standard Agency Model where Employees manage Agents ( Individual   Distributors who work on Commission ) , we were to develop a model where the Agents instead   of Employees would further recruit Agents and thereafter manage the team as Business   Associates .   This model was practised well in other countries across the globe ; it was now to be   introduced in <ADDRESS> .   The Challenge was that there was no historic data available on this method   of business in <ADDRESS> and it was a fairly new idea in the Indian Life Insurance Sector .   We were the   only company at that time with an ambitious plan to run this Business Associate Model .    Building the team of Agents and then grow them into Business Associates on Fast Track for both   geographies was a task which we had no knowledge of .   My KRA was to build this entire channel   and get business ( Revenue in terms of New Life Insurance Policy Premiums ) .   The main problem   was to sell this career opportunity where there was no fixed component in terms of <NAME> for   the Business Associates .   The career was a toilsome one where the Agents were to build a team   of their own without a fixed income component with an expectation of a rewarding returns in   terms of commission on own business and overrides over their team business post they got   promoted as Business Associates .   Such a career opportunity in Life Insurance Industry was not   available in <ADDRESS> earlier .     Selection :     The challenge was large and ambiguous and I thought of using the <NAME> method and the   Visualization method similar to what I have now learnt in this Design Thinking for Innovation   Course .   My past diverse <NAME> in Consumer Durable Industry , FMCG Industry and Life   Insurance Industry enabled me to have an open mind in an attempt to take up this challenge .    Although the Challenge was intimidating , yet the thrill to take it head on was overpowering .      Application :     I along with my team travelled extensively across my locations including interiors and met a lot   of people like homemakers , retired executives , young college pass outs , other financial services   agents , Accountants , Public Servants , Shcool Teachers   and other centre of influences who could   be my prospects .   I developed a questionnaire and I tried to understand what were their 

 inherent needs and aspirations , their fears and their thought about an alternative unorthodox   career opportunity where they could have flexibility of time and also have financial freedom .     All of them had different occupations , different income levels , different aspirations but a   common thread was the need to be financially sound , free from the worries and toils of   traditional employment .       Thereafter I organised Saturday Seminars where I would then invite them over to discuss the   business opportunity .   These would usually be a high impact Storytelling exercise and   Visualization , where I would encourage participants to freely discuss their apprehensions and   aspirations about life and through penning down important points on the board would try to   capture the Cause which would Compel them to try to look for an opportunity   to rise   above   their apprehensions and meet their aspirations .   Once the cause was set in the seminar , there   would usually be a lot of energy and suspense as to how I would help them get out of their   mundane careers and provide them that blissful financial freedom .    I would then answer them   in a way which would make them feel like living that future moment in that seminar room .   Many in the seminar would get emotional and I would then pause and make them get   comfortable .   Thereafter I would give examples of highly successful entrepreneurs who have   had humble beginnings and had struggle full lives and how they have come out of the same and   have become successful .   I would also show them Visuals and short <NAME> <NAME> of highly   successful Business Associates from all walks of life of my Organisation in other countries who   have made it big in Life .   I would also share that the path to this success would entail a lot of   hard work and challenge but it   was definitely worth giving it a try .   More so that they could try   this new opportunity keeping their current existing vocations in place and may either choose to   carry on doing both or later choosing to pursue the new opportunity full time .   This would sound   to many amongst the participants a golden opportunity to shape their lives the way they have   always dreamt of .    These seminars were a large success and we had high conversion rates   ( average of 30 % signups in an average seminar size of about 60 participants ) .     Meanwhile I had to sell the idea to my management that this method of Building the team   would work and I would present this idea to the Management using Storytelling again .   Of   course I used Visualization Technique as well trying to articulate my ideas through drawing and   sketches on board as well as having brain storming sessions to get my ideas across and to get   value additions from my peers and senior managers .   During this course I not only was able to   convince them about my idea , I also ended up getting valuable suggestions and feedback   regarding my idea which helped me in achieving my objective .      Within the first twelve months of my joining , we had succeeded in building a huge team of   Business Associates and Agents across <ADDRESS> and <NAME> who in turn were greatly successful   in bringing in business ( New Life Insurance Business- premiums ) which was about 190 % of the   original annual business plan for my region .         Insight :     This successful handling of the challenge using the Storytelling and Visualisation methods helped   me unearth the secrets of managing ambiguity in a smart and efficient manner .   I had applied   the techniques oblivious of the fact that these were part of Design Thinking process which I was   never trained in .    It gave me the freedom to think beyond the set boundaries of experience ,   knowledge , and set methods of doing business and gave me the impetus to take challenges 

 head on .   The journey since then has been exciting and challenging till today .    There have been   times where I have been successful and there have been times I have not .   Learning and   relevant application of Design Thinking tools became the cornerstone of my career and that of   my team .   Not only me as an individual but as the entire team as a whole we evolved , we used   Visualisation Techniques and <NAME> exercises in handling our day to day challenges and it   has since been a part and parcel of our lives .         Approach :     The learning and experiences of unknowingly applying the Design Thinking Methodologies in the   past , in the current and now my formal introduction to the Design Thinking for Innovation   Course has now made me to delve deep into this subject .   I will now study more regarding this   through the reference material suggested in the program videos and enrol for subsequent   higher programs on this subject .   I will also encourage my team and peers to enrol for this   amazing program , which would definitely help them succeed in the ambiguous business world .      I would continue to use the Design Thinking Tools I have used earlier and intend to use all   Design Thinking tools in the near future depending upon the Challenge which I would face .   For   now in my current assignment I intend to use the Learning Launch tool to face current   distribution challenges .   The reason I wish to use this tool is to quickly and economically   understand the best approach to widening our product distribution strategy in the increasingly   competitive environment .

"Design Thinking for Innovation – Week 5 

 Peer Graded Assignment 

 Example Reflection : Storytelling 

 Challenge and selection 

 <NAME> is a powerful tool that are applicable in various situation of our daily life , ergo it is   the tool that I applied all the time I work with vulnerable populations , developmentally disabled   individuals , senior citizens , and economically disadvantaged people . Many of these people deal   with oppression and dysfunction in every aspect of their lives , they need to be empowered and   Inspiration is a path to empowerment . As a marketers of a shampoo company , I always faced   the challenges of how to Attract   more customers to try and fall in love with our new launched   products . Besides , I also faced challenges of how to ensure the phenomenon of decreasing brand   loyalty towards our product   being happened as there are variety of choices for customers to   choose in the markets nowadays . 

 I choose to apply storytelling as it is able to get insight into users , build empathy and reach them   emotionally . I often create personas to represent target users and add conflict to stories that   reflects their users journeys and problems one of the reason is through crafting stories , We can   better understand what users want from a solution . Good stories always captivate audiences . In   user experience ( UX ) design , If designers use storytelling throughout the designing process to   ensure that all work focuses on the users ’ needs and the value that the company want to give   those users after completing design research to understand your users ’ needs and desires , you   use your insights to tell your story about who your users are and what they need And how you ’ll   provide that . These story makes it easy for everyone Involved in the project to empathize with   the users and <NAME> that their work matches the story . Having a story throughout your project   means marketing the design at the end of the design process is also straight forward , as you   already know exactly which story to tell to show how your product provides value . 

 Application 

 Storytelling indirectly involves emotional branding . Emotional branding in fact is the practice off   building brands that directly appeal to consumers ’ self , emotional state , needs and aspirations .   The purpose of emotional branding is to establish a connection between consumers and products 

 by stimulating consumer emotions . Human needs such as love , power , emotional security and   self satisfaction are based on emotions in subconscious , as the basis of emotional brands and   allow marketers to create self fulfilling prophecies in consumer demand . People want to meet   demand , and advertisers need to implement these needs in a permanent cycle . Our company has   launched a new anti dandruff treatment shampoo product lines that allows real woman to share   their product experience in “ Beauty Me Anti Dandruff Diary ” through videos and blog where the   real women share their hair dandruff stories and how new products can save them . A YouTube- designed diary channel also spurred a Facebook app that was once again designed as a diary . In   addition to similar YouTube channels , the Secret Diary app provides more information about hair   and products . Creating a secret diary , revealing products as a solution and letting real women   share their anti dandruff secrets is supporting the two pillars of the sport . This types of   storytelling enables new customers more willingness to embark their journey on our products as   the review is real and high credibility . 

 Insight 

 By applying the learning tool , we designed and tested our solutions . Through the learning process   we got to improve our product ’s function and design to meet user ’s expectation . It is through   this process we realized that the customers were more attract to the review from the Facebook   as it   is shared by normal users but not celebrity or influencer . Our marketing department used   the results of this process to re - strategize our marketing campaign . Moving forward our business   will focus on human centred design to improve our product and services . 

 Approach 

 Through applying the storytelling tools , another tools like visualization and mind - mapping   directly applied . In order to perform a more perfect result , learning launch is another tool that I   would be considered in the next steps . One of the reason is learning launch is also an important   tool of our business . We need as a team to review the insight gained from our first two launches   and incorporate this insight into future launch designs as this is the most effective and ideal way   of approaching and implementing solutions . Future launch designs should reflect insight gained ,   process made , and come closer to a compelling solution ready for full roll out .

"Challenge & Selection 

 Storytelling is a great tool and largely used by managers to motivate executives and customers .   It has personally helped me lot of time to relate with people on ground and in office . My job   profile involves lot of travelling to rural areas where people speak different tongue , which I   could understand partially and they mine . It was a challenge and fun to communicate with   them and to do business . 

 <ADDRESS> , rural people are more friendly and talkative . They love to communicate most of the   things and it helped me to build relation as well as to do business . 

 Storytelling helps to pass information in a structured way ; people could easily relate to it and   also remember it for longer time . It has helped me to communicate and has proved as   icebreaker . 

 Application 

 I applied this when I was placed in rural <ADDRESS> , and I could n’t speak their mother   tongue . Initially after few days , I picked up their language and could understand and they mine   because of national official language .   The product which I was handling / financing was of higher   ticket size and involved lot information to be collected from customer . People are not   comfortable most of the times to share personal information . I had to spend three to four   hours with the customers in their agriculture fields , analyzing crops and income from it .   <NAME> helped me to easily gather information without making customers uncomfortable .   As we had initially language barrier , storytelling helped me not only to do business but also to   spend extra time and make friends . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Customers started opening up and shared their problems , and also referred me new leads . The extra   time which I could spend with them due to storytelling , helped me to know about their projects and   assets deployment .    They also helped me to do field investigation with genuine information of the new   leads .   Basically it helped me to build relationship and to gain trust . 

 This tool helped me to know people , resolve problems either in office or on field .

"Reflection – Story telling 

 Challenge 

 I am currently pursuing my MBA from a reputed institution . We as a part of the program are given tons   of assignments and presentations to complete as a group activity . There are lots of challenges that we   face in a group project or presentation . One main challenge that I faced is lack of cooperation between   the members . As a team leader , I had to bring all the team members together and make them work   towards the common goal of our team . 

 Selection 

 To overcome this problem , I chose the design thinking tool -   Story telling . Through this online course , I   have understood the importance / significance and need of this particular tool . Story telling helps capture   the attention of the audience for a long period of time as compared to a normal lecture which would   only attract 20 % of the attention as said by the professor in the story telling module . Due to all such   benefits of this method , I have chosen this tool for finding the solution to my problem . 

 Application 

 There were lots of positive responses to using this tool . Once I started opening up to my team mates and   sharing stories of how a team needs to perform and why it is very important to be coordinated in a   team , I could gain attention from them and altogether they started co - operating with me to achieve the   goal . I shared my own personal experience of working as a team in my school days and winning a   competition which was only possible due to the coordination that was present in my team . All my team   mates believed in ourselves and we all worked together to achieve our goal and win that competition . 

 Hearing this story , my team mates were really motivated and geared up to perform better and   complete our assignments successfully . 

 Insight 

 This experience on a whole was very insightful . I learnt the importance of design thinking and the need   of <NAME> telling tool . I also understood the importance of team work and the techniques that we can use   to gain people ’s attention . The course had really inculcated so much of knowledge on me . It will   definitely be of immense use in the future when I manage a team in a company . 

 Approach 

 Now that I have learnt the need and importance of design thinking and innovation , I would definitely   use it in the future when I become a team leader in a firm . It would be of great use for me to be   successful in my organization and gain confidence . I would use the story telling method especially as it is   a great way to increase response and gain attention of the audience as compared to other methods . 

 I am really grateful for the professors in the program to have taught me a very important tool that   would be of immense help for me in the future . 

 I look forward to use it in the real corporate world and achieve success !

"Story   telling 

 ​challenge and selection     We use storytelling all the time I spend most of the time with teachers ,   friends and family . We encounter many stories in a day . it may be the   stories we share or it may be the stories we know or the stories see .   Stories help us understand their   interest goals and thought process . We   can understand them better and can help them improve .     Application 

 I am returning home after completion of my classes then I saw a woman   with lifeless eyes full of depression.i just thought she needed someone to   share all the things she is facing and then went to her and asked if she is   okay and she began telling her life is hard ..

"Balance work - free time – Storytelling      Challenge & Selection    During the course of Design Thinking I have discovered that I am already using <NAME> . I am   Storyteller and I can confirm that this is such a great tool .   The last years have demonstrated me that   there is a imbalance between the career and the free time . The most affected persons are the one   between 28 - 42 years old . I am interacting and working with this category of employees .   Many of these   people deal with an imbalance life and with all the inconveniences that are arising from this . This   imbalance is also affecting their careers , their personality and their interactions with their colleagues .    Every organization has this type of employees . The general solutions are not so efficient like the ones   who are answering to the employee ’s needs . I spend a lot of time finding a solution for having a good   work environment , interacting directly with employees in imbalance periods of their lives . Storytelling   seems to me very efficient because in the moment you share real life stories , solutions and   achievements the peoples get more connected ant they find their optimism and their goal to balance   their own lives . Happy people means happy work environment and the best results .   That is why it was   necessary to find out the reasons that lead to this imbalance , how to correct it , to find the correct   approach in order to stabile this employees attitude towards their life and their career .    The organization management requested for solutions in order to help this category of employees ,   most of them very valuable employees .    Application    The projects are based on real stories , persons and real advices . Persons who had gone through   imbalance periods of their lives shared their stories and the solutions that helped them to find the   balance .   In this scope , we decide to start to develop special projects related to discussions with the   people involved , finding the solutions to make them to share their stories , problems , goals . The   projects have as a main goal to use the correct information in order to develop different strategies in   order to help the above mentioned employees to balance their lives and to create a better work   environment . After many discussions and surveys , using the storytelling and based on the results of   the storytelling and the power of example , we established a mechanism in order to comfort and to   support the employees which are running imbalanced period of times and difficulties arising from it .     The results are immediate . The last case we had : a young man , 34 years old , very efficient and talented ,   with an imbalance life . In the last two months the results of his activity become affected , also the   interaction with his colleagues . His attitude become hostile and the relationships with her colleagues   were getting worse . It is true that the first approach it is difficult , but sharing real life examples helps   all the time and help also the most vulnerable people to open and to share their own problems .   Insight & Approach    The direct discussions with him , the sharing of my personal experience and the advices that   were tested in other situations , with good results has made him realize the necessity to   balance his life , to improve his attitude regarding the career and personal life .    Nowadays , he is involved and he is also sharing his story with his colleagues passing through   similar experiences .   After the projects results , it seems that the organization management decided to follow them in order   to help other employees in this type of situation . It is easier , more efficient and it seems that after   sharing life experience , the trust and confidence are gained . Employees get to know that they can be   helped in their difficult period of times and employers obtain a good work environment and the best   results .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The team that I am part of   had been involved in the launch and promotion of a new service our   organization is providing . The biggest challenge for us was on how to make this service appealing as   even though it is more technical , reliant and successful in helping our customer , the interface of it   was easily misunderstood by out clients ( not interested in the technical bits ) and assimilated with   other services they encountered on the market and have n’t reached their expectation . WE decided   the storytelling was the best way to approach the promotion of this new service , alongside demos . 

 Opposed to show them just the classical demos and boring videos we decided that storytelling will   help us to put together of ideas and bits of information rather than the laying out of a discrete series   of features and functionalities . 

 Application 

 Like images , stories allowed us to access emotions and emphasize experiences . They added the   richness of context and allowed us to “ sell ” a problem as well as its solution . By using this tool , we   build identification and empathy with their characters and help managers to develop a personal   investment in their welfare and also keep the audience awake . 

 What makes a story a good story is down to the opinion of the audience and of course , we realized   that our storytelling might not always suit everybody ’s tastes , but we focused on a couple of items   that can keep the audience focused . 

 First , we made it entertaining as this would be the starting point of making your customers engaged   and chewing at the bit to see what ’s to come next . 

 We also tried to make it personalize and tell a story that is personal and easily relate to and also   educational . We realized that an educational narrative kept the audience engaged through curiosity . 

 Last but not least , we made the content memorable by telling a story that was entertaining ,   educational , relatable , and well written . This did not only helped our message to stay with your   audience but also conjure up positive connotations towards our service brand . 

 Insight & Approach 

 What worked for us , was a story based on a hero ’s <NAME> . It is a common theme in story structures   constructed by many cultures throughout the world . It is entertaining , but simple and everyone could   related to it . The hero character , facing many adversities and challenges , ventures out into the   unknown to acquire something themselves or something they care for desperately needs . In order to   obtain this goal , the hero shows courage and bravery , overcoming their foes , conquering their   greatest fears , and prevailing in the face of total disaster . And once the monsters have been   defeated , the hero returns home . Triumphant , a great weight on their conscious lifted , they find   peace in their hearts and meaning in their life . 

 We put the customer in the role of the triumphant hero and our service as the thing that will get   them there !

"Challenge & Selection     For this assignment , I reflect on healthcare challenges with the coronavirus ( COVID 19 ) using   the <NAME> tool .   After years working as a professional in healthcare my work now focuses   to support clinicians .   The COVID pandemic has caused considerable problems for our   healthcare system including but not limited to shortage of hospital beds , supplies , personal   protective equipment ( PPE ) , and medications .   In the past , I have used <NAME> to motivate   staff and co - workers as special needs arose , e.g. , supporting an executive decision , changes in   leadership , or meeting a financial goal .   Many of the stories I used in the past were those of   human interest , historical figures , or events .   These stories helped to encourage change , foster   innovation , and create excitement .   No story however , is so surreal as the current worldwide   COVID 19 pandemic and it ’s potentially catastrophic impact to the lives and economy of our   world . 

 Application      As <NAME> <NAME> of <ADDRESS> mentions in his video , knowing your audience is essential .   In this   case , my audience are fellow clinicians and as such we share a common professional language ,   mindset , and emotional concerns .   Everyone is keenly aware of the pandemic ( touching much   more than the usual 20 % ) as information from 24 x 7 news sources constantly repeats the   sequence of events leading to this crisis as well as moment to moment changes in our country .   I leverage this story to create urgency for our team to think creatively to solve the problems we   face to deliver care to patients .   Brainstorming solutions entail using virtual technology , solving   resource shortages such as personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and medications , and   supporting new facilities that are being created exclusively to cohort COVID 19 patients .      Numerous questions are asked and remain unanswered .   Questions such as mortality of the   virus , social impact ( i.e. shaking hands , social distancing , etc . ) , job loss , work from home ,   telemedicine , and the financial impact , can not completely be answered until the crisis subsides .   We can all agree however that our cultures will be dramatically different in the future . 

 Insight and Approach       In my years in healthcare , I have never seen people respond to a challenge with so much   enthusiasm and dedication .   <NAME> discussed process changes to accomodate high patient   volumes and creative staffing solutions , considering especially those with small children or   elderly parents to care for .   It ’s apparent this story ​is​ impactful but I ’m happy to see we can still   unite for common goals despite our differences .   This story may be somewhat unusual for this   assignment but it ’s a real life example of how design thinking tools ( Storytelling , Visualization ,   etc . ) can be valuable to inspire creativity and innovation even during a crisis .   Today , I ca n't   think of anything I would do differently or think of another story that would have been more   effective .   As we debrief from this crisis in the future , we will innovate and be better prepared to   meet similar issues in the future .

"REFLECTION – VISUALIZATION & MIND MAPPING 

 CHALLENGE   Design thinking is a well - defined approach to generate and experiment with ideas in an Innovation driven   organization . Working in such organization with a user centric design approach , requires continuous   innovation for new business exploration as well as to improve existing products designs . I ’m a design and   innovation lead from such organization focusing on consumer electronics . I ’m a member of new business   exploration and my / our challenge is to improve the functionality of a certain product segment by   conducting ideation workshops across cross - functional teams . 

 The scope of the workshop is to generate ideas on a specific product segment based on themes such as   ( i)Multi - functional usage ; ( ii ) Performance improvement ; ( iii)Weight and Size reduction ; respectively .   Then select the top 2 ideas from each themes for detailed conceptual designing and pitch the concepts to   top management team of our organization . 

 SELECTION   Since the idea generation process involves various insights from various stake holders , the design thinking   tools such as Visualization , Brainstorming and Mind mapping were applied . These tools were thought to   help our stake holders to convey their imagination in a pictorial / graphical form and guide them to find   patterns and insights from their ideas . As we know , <NAME> is a tool where a pictorial or graphical   form helps us clearly understand the idea / insight rather in a verbal / written form . Whereas , Brainstorming   allows the person to map his experience and learning to generate ideas for a certain use case .   And mind   mapping allows to identify patterns & insights in available data . 

 APPLICATION   For this ideation workshop , a total of 18 people from cross - functions were teamed into 3 consisting of   various age groups and work experience . All the 18 people were familiar with the product segment   chosen . Then , each team is allocated a theme as mentioned earlier and they were requested to brainstorm   their ideas based on allocated theme . Each person of the team were requested to provide at least 5 ideas ,   Write / Picture them on sticky notes and stick them on respective walls provided . 20 minutes were given   for brainstorming their ideas and post them on the wall . 

 As a next activity , with a pool of ideas on the wall , each group were requested to find for any   insights / patterns between their ideas and group them based on certain aspects . Each team members of   the group discussed their ideas within themselves and came up with a conclusive classification . Then we   went through a sharing session of all the ideas from each team with a question / answer session . The entire   session went about 30 minutes explaining their insights and their idea classification approach . 

 For the next activity , each team were requested to select top 2 ideas and create a graphic   picture / representation of the concept in a poster size along with a justification of ‘ Why / How it works ? ’ ;   ‘ What problem it solves ? ’ ; <NAME> ? ; This activity went through about 15 minutes followed by a   presentation session by each team .   As the teams presented their concepts with visual designs and   justification , I / we began recording the insights from each group . 

 Once the session is completed , we digitized the top 2 ideas from of each team and compiled the shared   insights to a concept proposals for pitching it to our management team . 

 INSIGHT & APPROACH   The outcome of this ideation workshop was obtaining a refined Concept with a shared insights from   various stake holders of various functions . The team members had a collaborative approach to identify a   problem and generate a valuable idea . The Visualization of ideas presented by each team helped everyone   to picturize the concept in the same perspective of the presenter . The team members were sportive in   their brainstorming sessions , sharing their individual insights by uncovering the pattern and connections   between other ideas . This clearly demonstrates their mind mapping approach . Thus , the design thinking   tools that we used for this ideation workshop had a positive outcome with a valuable concept being   generated . 

 Overall , it is essential for any innovation workshop to have a design thinking process and utilize the   respective tools in a valuable way . We also decided to include <NAME> telling tool from our next workshop   to pitch the concepts in an attractive way !

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge     As an IT Leader , I ’m working a lot on all digital transformation topics and I need to constantly   bring new innovative digital products to the organisation . I also need to review existing way   of working and processes .   On one of the project I ’ve recently worked on , I was working with different business   departments and we wanted to revamp entirely an internal solution supporting a large   operational activity . The current application was outdated and developing a new one was the   opportunity to rethink how we should perform the tasks .   We was limited in time and wanted to launch this new product quickly . But it was very   important to associate many business users to this revamp and to have everyone thinking   out of the box , not just implementing incremental innovation .       Selection     I created a group of users and IT professionals . All together , we ’ve conducted some design   thinking workshop to brainstorm about how we could perform this operational activity on a   better way . I ’ve decided to dedicate the first session to explain what is design thinking and   how we ’ll proceed . then I ’ve conduction then other workshops to map the existing processes ,   user journey within this process , and identification of all the pain points .    I use What Is / What if / What Wows / What works   questions and framework as explained on   week 1 . I ’ve explained this framework and we went through all the questions .       Application     On the first session , I ’ve presented the What is / What if / What wows / What works   framework . We ’ve shared about this approach and had open discussions about the   uncertainty and what will come next this “ discovery phase ” .   We took the time of this first   session and few days between this first and the second workshop to let people think about   all this and understand well all ideas and be in the “ right mindset ” for the upcoming work .   On the second session , we ’ve conducted visual mapping with sticky notes of all pain points   the users are experiencing today , as well as all features they think they could be a game   changer . Then we grouped all these sticky notes by type of issues and we draw the   end - to - end process from these sticky notes .   We had then a visual representation of the end - to - end process from a user perspective , with   all the pain points and opportunities identified along this process . We did that on large paper   boards on all walls of the meeting room .   We then started to answer the What If question and we proceed on the same way , with   sticky notes . Everyone participate and we came out with great ideas . We took all these ideas   and we use all of its to map the needed transformation from where we are to where we want   to go . 

 The following workshops have been more dedicated to some sub - processes and to answer   the “ what works ” question . We came out with great solutions we would not have been able to   identify on a more traditional approach and have moved on into some rapid prototypes .       Insight      By applying some visualisation tools and making all actions into the general design thinking   framework , it helps all participant to be active participant . We saved lot of time as we   mapped all processes , pain points , and new solutions into very graphic way , like a mind   map . By doing these both interactives sessions and visual representation , we avoided miss   understanding between participants , have been able to quickly focus on the questions that   matter , and not be distracted by not so important topics .   Also , about the new solution we designed , it helps everyone to have a general   understanding very easily , which helps to communicate outside of the group about this   solution and our decisions . We saved a lot of time about getting th buy - in from other senior   leaders .       Approach     I ’m happy to have explained the big picture and full framework at first . I ’m also happy to use   brainstorming techniques but within clear questions . It helps to drive participation and to   have everyone to think out of the box without creating bias . However , what I may do   differently is to combine this visualisation processes with the rapid launch and prototyping at   the same time , all together . I believe we could move even faster and reinforce the   participation of all staff .

"Tool :   Visualization 

 Challenge : 

 The need to have complete returns on Currency Transaction Report to the regulatory bodies . Report   on transactions carried out at the Bank on a weekly basis are reported to the Nigerian Financial   Intelligence Unit ( Rose - Hulman ) . Where there are shortfalls in reporting , the Bank can be sanctioned . We   noticed a slight difference and same was fixed using the visualization and other design thinking tools . 

 Selection : 

 The visualization tool was prominently used in this process . This tool helped in having in your mind ’s   eye the exact end result of the challenge . Brought some pictorial representations of the stages leading   to the resolution . We dad in our minds ( including the team members and stakeholders ) what we   needed to achieve , which is complete returns to the regulatory bodies . 

 Application : 

 A stakeholders meeting was held selling to them the end point or desired result of the resolution   meeting . Drew a picture of what must be achieved and went into thinking and finally dished out ideas   that led to achieving the aim of the meeting thereby having complete returns on Currency Transaction   Reporting to the regulators . 

 Insight : 

 In using the visualization process , I was able to realize that reflection over challenges can result in   finding step by step solutions . Visualization tool enabled me to have a clear vision or mindset of what   I needed to achieve at the point in time and attention was focused on achieving same . This can be   applied in our everyday life . 

 Approach : 

 Next time , I will ensure such meeting is held early enough to avoid being tensed before finding a   solution . Engagement of stakeholders will also start at the point the challenge is noticed .

"<NAME> <NAME> - <NAME> <NAME> for <NAME> final paper 

 Challenge     I am in charge of the operations of a company that provides medical digital imaging solutions 

 to hospitals and clinics . These solutions comprise hardware such as servers , work stations , 

 medical grade monitors , direct radiology and computer radiology digitizers among others . 

 The digitized imaging is then managed by a Picture Archiving and Communications System 

 that works together with a Radiology Information System , in charge of managing the imaging 

 department workflow .   You probably got losted or bored halfway the previous paragraph or , if you read it all , are 

 wondering what does my company really do , what value it offers , and why would a hospital 

 need such solution . This is not any different to what many of our potential customers felt 

 every time we approached them to start a conversation . In other cases , the customer had an 

 idea of the solution but did not know exactly why he needed it , the scope of it and the many 

 advantages they could derive from it . There was and still is some confusion in our market 

 regarding the best way to implement these solutions , in part due to companies that focus on 

 selling technology more than on solving problem through it by designing tailor made 

 solutions .     Selection     We thought it was necessary to do something to educate our potential customers on the 

 advantages of implementing digital medical imaging solutions , the scope and scalability 

 nature of it and how it could help them solve their pain points and get results that were not 

 possible with their current analog processes , such as generating data and information for 

 decision making . We needed our customers informed and on board before moving toward a 

 proposal to close a deal .   To do this we selected a storytelling approach , and decided to hire a marketing company to 

 produce an informative video of our solution . We thought that a video was a good tool to 

 illustrate and provide a good idea of all the components of our solution and how they worked 

 together to generated value , without needing to go too in depth with the technicalities 

 involved .     Application   Even if the production of the video happend before I took this course , I can relate to many 

 aspects mentioned in the interview to <NAME> <NAME> from <ADDRESS> , Inc. that were key in 

 producing a compelling and effective story for our customers .   For instance , we decided not to do a video focused on the technology behind our solution 

 but on the impact it has on patients that went to a hospital to have an x - ray or other medical 

 imaging study , as we wanted to appeal to our audience ( hospital directors and heads of 

 imaging service ) by highlighting aspects of their everyday life that they could easily relate to ; 

 and so we created an animated character called “ Don Salvador ” , an elder that needed an 

 x - ray exam . Even if patients were our indirect customers , we decided that telling the story of 

 a day of a patient at a hospital was a good way to show want they went through when the 

 imaging service used analog technology ( long appointment deferrals , long waits to get the 

 <NAME> <NAME> - <NAME> <NAME> for <NAME> final paper 

 exam done and the diagnosis ready , the need of repeating a study because the image was 

 not clear enough , and the use hazardous chemicals in the film developing process , among 

 others ) compared to using a digital technology . Therefore , the story took place in a hospital 

 that was using our solution and <NAME> was telling the differences he perceived from this 

 experience as opposed to previous exams he had taken on hospitals with analog processes . 

 This was key as it allowed our audience to understand the “ why ” of implementing our 

 solutions as they had to deal with unsatisfied patients and radiologist everyday that suffered 

 the inefficiencies of the analog technology .   Technology itself was present in the story but it was on the background and always tied to 

 the benefits it produced to the patient of the radiologists so it had meaning to the audience .   To conclude , I think the video was a success as it engaged the audience by showing the 

 problems an old technology was creating to their own staff ( doctors and x - ray technicians ) , 

 to their patients and the opportunity cost of not having digitized data to the hospital 

 administrators , and it made them realize and feel the needed to take action and solve those 

 problems . As <NAME> mentioned in his interview , the main character was a representation of a 

 big wicked problem every hospital was facing ( by not being able to provide good care of their 

 patients ) , we created a moment to reflect on it and presented a way to solve this challenge .     Insights   By producing this video we realized that there were people within our organization that was 

 not clear about the value we offered through our solutions . Even technical staff that did not 

 fully understand its benefits and the impact to our customers and patients , because they 

 were too specialized in certain parts of the solution ( i.e. software of hardware , 

 implementation , training , etc ) . The video was shared internally with all areas and it helped 

 engage everyone with the business as it was clear that with every project we implemented 

 there were patients benefiting from it . It gave our business a good purpose to work for .   As our staff got more engaged we realized that we had untapped potential and understood 

 that going forward we needed to share and make an effort to explain any new company 

 initiative even with staff that were not directly involved .     Approach   I am very satisfied with the results and insights we got during the production of the video and 

 when it was shared internally and with potential customers . The empathy towards our 

 customers is part of our company ’s culture and this was useful when writing the story of our 

 animated video as we knew their pain points very well . If I should tackle this challenge again 

 from the beginning I would choose the same storytelling approach and media . Still , even if 

 we feel we know our customers so well , I would involve them in the process of creating the 

 story . Many times we have shared the video with potential customers , they come out with 

 new pain points and aspects of their everyday life that are not included in our story and that 

 would have added great value to it .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge and selection     As students , one of the problems we face the most is teamwork . Although skills are   necessary within projects , the most complicated thing is to find a way to communicate   your idea correctly to your colleagues . Several times I have been lucky enough to work   with colleagues who think very similar to me , which facilitates communication , but on   other occasions , I have had to use a certain tool to be able to make clear my idea and a   correct plan to work . In one of these cases , all my teammates had different ideas about   how we could develop the work , and reach an agreement we had to capture it in a   sketch .     As we already know , visualization is the tool that makes our idea tangible and concrete .   In our case , trying to describe our ideas only with words was not working , it was   because of this that we decided to implement the visualization , this way we all could   outline our ideas and make the best decisions for our project .     Application     The first step was brainstorming between all of us , we capture all the ideas on a   blackboard . We had done previous research , so it was easy to generate the key   concepts that we thought were important . After that , we analyzed and selected the best   options , which would become our main goal to achieve . We started the first sketch , all   of us were in the same line , this facilitated a lot the communication inside the team and   allowed us to improve our work .     The next step was to clean the sketch we had until we finished our prototype . We   decided to show it to some classmates to get some feedback , later we met to analyze   how we could solve the weaknesses that our partners found . To solve this , we made a   mind - map , where we stated the weaknesses and the possible solutions . Once we had a   concrete idea of our mistakes , we found the best solution .     Insight and approach     Students usually complain when we have to work in teams , it is much easier to work on   our own because we only have to deal with our ideas , even in those cases it is useful to   create a visual idea that represents what we plan to do . Working in teams is usually   complicated because describing the idea that we have in our head is very complicated ,   you have to translate it so that your colleagues can understand it in the same way that   you do . Our team found it difficult at the beginning because we could n’t communicate   with each other , we did not know how to express ourselves correctly , and visualization   was the perfect tool to solve our problem . The visualization allowed us all to share our   ideas and gather them into one , which we knew how to work in a synchronized way 

 because it was reflected the same for all of us . It was also easier to identify our   mistakes on a map and find the best solution .     We could have saved a lot of discussion time if we had decided to implement this tool   from the beginning , but I also think that other tools could be very useful , for example ,   mind - mapping . Mind - mapping is useful when we have to capture information and ideas ,   and , as I already told you , we used brainstorming in our project , so using mind - mapping   could have helped us to organize our ideas and make easier our process .      In conclusion , I think we learned a lot about these visual thinking tools , but there is so   much we have to apply in order to improve our skills .

"Reflection : Kneading our future 

 Challenge 

 Running an independent bakery , as with any small shop , presents a set of challenges in a world led by   chain stores . We are competing with giants who promise lower costs , longer menus and more locations .   Back when our project started , most days we felt like the shop – we – were simply surviving , working   long hours , generating little profit , and barely keeping heads above water . 

 The French <NAME> had been a family business since 1970 . My parents had opened the first brick and   mortar back in <ADDRESS> , in the small town of <ADDRESS> , and moved to <ADDRESS> , VA in 1982 . The store quite   literally moved overseas with us . When my parents died in 2002 , I took over the shop and , in homage to   their legacy , kept everything as it was . By 2012 , we had a small set of specialties we ’d stuck to for 44   years – 20 staples that drew a crowd of regulars – but that model was no longer sustainable . By 2010 , a   10 % profit loss was having us headed towards closure . 

 Selection 

 We needed to refresh , a new brand , an edge . As I shaped my vision for The French <NAME> , I opted to tell   a story . Storytelling provided an opportunity to showcase the French <NAME> ’s identity through the   decades and reveal its essence . I wanted the team , the store , to emotionally connect with customers by   telling our family ’s story in a way that clients could understand and relate to . We had lost customers – or   simply bored them to competition – because we had become just another place that makes bread . But ,   really , who does n’t love sweets ? Or bread ? More importantly , who is n’t emotionally connected , moved   even , by the taste of a cookie or a cake ? Drawing on our customers ’ connection to food , and food ’s   unparalleled ability to bring people together and memories back , I knew storytelling would be my best   bet . 

 Application & Insights 

 Like with any impactful change , I stepped out of my comfort zone . The first key stage of shaping our   story was to speak with a few regular customers and to our team – the ethnographic approach to   gathering data . The team was overworked , but mostly they just felt disconnected to their work . Some   did not even know the entire history of the shop . Our customers still loved our specialties , which they   found to taste good , but a short survey revealed that 64 % wished traditional American staples were part   of the menu as well , and 47 % stated they wanted to see more French patisseries . Revamping the menu   was a priority to cater to our customers base . The space too had never been renovated due to lack of   funds . I had been so scared to incur short term losses to invest in the space , so attached to the past and   so anxious in the present that I had never strayed from the original menu . 

 Ultimately , my family ’s history was not only the history of a bakery , it was an immigrant ’s story , and a   story of biculturalism . I updated the menus to include both traditional American baked goods , and   traditional French patisserie and breads . Our specialties stayed in our now bigger display window , and   were renamed after my family members , with a short paragraph under the name explaining why 40   years ago my family chose it to be on its menu . The shop was also renovated , to look modern yet   inviting , in shades of ivory and yellow that would highlight the art on the walls : framed black and white   pictures of me and my parents in the shop over the years – kneading , baking , interacting with   customers . The frames were placed in chronological order , with short captions underneath them 

 recounting each step of our journey across continents and sharing the pastries and desserts that were so   intensely tied to each memory . A dining space was created for clients to eat in at a long rectangular   table for all to share while they enjoyed a dessert . 

 By telling a more complete story of my family and the shop ’s history , the team working in the kitchens   found purpose in their work , upkeeping and furthering the legacy of my parents . The wider menu also   increased engagement : the team learned new techniques and recipes and felt empowered by their   larger skill sets . The narrative not only led customers to connect to the store and its products , as well as   try our new dishes , it soon became clear that by telling them our story through food and atmosphere ,   they relived their own story — a bite of pie jolting long lost childhood memories . This led us to two   additional changes : a memory book at the entrance of the shop to ask customers to share a story about   a dessert or baked good and the memory it revives and lastly , the change to a new name for the shop :   Piramal Enterprises , the author who described being taken back to his childhood in the French   countryside each time , as an adult , he bit into a Ex <NAME> , Inc .. 

 Approach 

 With this customer - centric approach , and sharing stories to engage my team , we together accomplished   a great deal and were able to grow again . If I had wanted to do it another way , I could have also used   learning launches , making small changes little by little , experiencing with different menu options and   creating hypotheses about what products they would want to see on the menu .

"Learning Launch – Premium Ice Cream Business 

 Challenge : 

 I work as a Brand / Innovation Manager for a leading FMCG company in <ADDRESS> . A serious challenge   that we were faced with recently was despite being the market leaders in the ice cream category   with a 61 % volume share we had the slowest growth rate vs our competition for the past three years .   In other words , contrary to what our original role in the category should have been , which is to   increase the per capita ice cream consumption in <ADDRESS> , we were doing exactly the opposite and   dragging the ice cream category ’s growth down . When we dig deeper using all the primary and   secondary data available , in the form of consumer connects and retail audit reports , we discovered   that we were out paced by the competition in the ‘ Premium ice cream ’ segment which was growing   2.5 times the category . The key reason behind our failure in this segment was that we have not been   able to keep at pace with the market in terms of our innovation speed and variety . 

 Selection : 

 Premium ice cream segment had never been a forte for our company , but it was now becoming more   important by the day owing to the rate it which it has started growing . However , at this stage we   were n’t confident to do a full - fledged launch or ready for a huge financial commitment on the revamp   on premium business so we decided to do a learning launch as it could prove to be a cheap and fast   litmus test to check the efficacy of our plans . 

 Application : 

 We deployed our learning launch in the largest metro city in the country i.e. Karachi . The city has a   population of roughly 15 Million , comprising of people from all parts of the country . Hence , we knew   the results from this city can be well representative for the overall population of <ADDRESS> . There   were a total of two things that we wanted to test with the consumers : 

 1- We want to test out different flavors and see what we was working and what was n’t to make a 

 playbook of flavors for when we scale up the operations 

 2- We wanted to see what go to market strategy works best with the consumer , we had 

 deployed three simultaneously 

 We deployed a small - scale learning launch two months back in only 150 top - end stores , 50 Petro   Marts and 10 Malls of the city . The pilot is coming along well and we continue to fetch as much data   and insights from the experiment as possible . So far the approach seems promising , we have been   able to churn out some important insights that can come in very handy when we are eventually   scaling up in other cities . 

 It was initially difficult to deploy the learning launch in in malls due to COVID’19 , however with all   safety precautions in place we have been able to have smooth mall operations also . 

 Insight : 

 Some of the insights that we have got form the experiments were really eyeopeners for us . We learnt   that the agility is going to be key in this market , the consumers in this segment is always looking for   something new , something that wows them . Hence , if we are to win in this segment , we must always   have a new news waiting for our consumers . We also got to learn that the flavors were not the only   thing that drove consumer excitement color , texture , fusion with adjacent categories and   experimentation of format was equally important . This experimentation also helped us curate our   flavor strategy , for instance we were able to form a playbook that shows exactly the four major flavor   palettes that exists in <ADDRESS> and when we are thinking to innovate we must think from the lens of   which of the flavor palette we have a weak play in .   The GTM bit is yet to be answered , we are still   gathering data on that front . 

 Approach : 

 As mentioned before , so far that learning launch seems to be a very useful tool . Moving forward we   will be corroborating all the information from the three months pilot , putting the learnings together   in the form a strategy pieces that will be utilized as we scale up our operations in Q4 2020 .

"Reflection – visualization 

 Finding a solution ! 

 Challenge :   to propose a solution to problem that an entire community have about   how to manage part of the waste in order to be more concern about their garbage and   the environmental . It involve different members or stakeholders and the challenge is   find a simple way in which everybody involve can understand it and be part of it giving   some ideas in order to execute them and overcome that issue . 

 Selection : It was decided to make use of the visualization tools because it is a tool in   which everybody can participate and easy to understand quickly , also it implies a   brainstorming and the communication of all parties involve . 

 Application : the first step taken was to show a base propose ( taking all considerations   and concerns of the all parts involve , it was an outside perspective ) to the community ,   authorities and companies involve , in this base propose it was identified the problem   and its causes , some actions that they could do and how it would affected to   everybody in a positive way .   You would see this base plan in the image attached . The   next step was to take advantage in that reunion ( showing the base plan ) to make all of   them understand the idea and the propose ( and not seeing it as a problem of each   group and not being relate ) but also it was an opportunity to collect opinions and   ideas of them and put it automatically inside the plan and use them to improve and   achieve a master plan in which everybody are agree and feel part of it . 

 Insight : this tool showed that when a lot of people are involved in something and they   have to find a common way to get out of something is better to do it in a way that   everybody understand clearly , quickly and feel part of it . 

 Approach : Applying this tool to this kind of situation helps to see it as a capable tool to   use not only in a personal way or small groups but also in a wider range , therefore , it   would be use it again but making it stronger combine it with other tool .

"Example Reflection :     Storytelling     Challenge & Selection :   I work at a not - for - profit organization in the Business Development sector . In my first quarter   of leading the team , we faced a bottleneck of events being extremely cliché and not being   able to attract audience and footfall since the past three years . Every year , we 'd use the   same approach , similar panel speakers and theme , which resulted in failure .   This year , my team and I decided to change our perspective , and adapt a storytelling   approach . The theme of the event which was : Youth Development , got changed to Let Your   Voice Be Heard , and our marketing plan was aligned to a customer centric approach with   stories of selected attendees from the workshop in terms of how they had an all round   development post this workshop .     Application :   Now , with the strategies in place . We designed the entire event in lines using the storytelling   methodology . Each of the keynotes and speeches and discussions were carefully outlined   with stories from their lives that resonated with the idea of Youth Development which   celebrated the essence of storytelling as the attendees felt connected throughout the   workshop . Post this , we had an open space , a new concept and innovation to the event   where we boxed out major ideas discussed in the events and asked our attendees to write   about their own experience in anyone of the central ideas discussed about Youth   Development on a piece of paper and put them in these seperate boxes .     Insight :    We noticed approximately , a three hundred percent spike in the number of attendees . From   barely about 110 attendees in the first three years , we saw an enormous jump upto about a   crowd of 450 . What went better ? Through our surveys , the engagement through the event   saw a leap of about sixty five percent ! And this was all due to changing the central plan from   a fact and figure based event to a storytelling event with every youth experiencing an all   round development and engagement of the people .     Approach :   Seeing these insights . We formulated a plan of action of executing a series of such events   throughout the year . Smaller workshops targetting on an all round development of the youth .   We will now conduct these events for the youth that are about to graduate with limited   seating for about four times a year . The stories will be coming in from various youth   speakers who have become industry experts and how the youth could develop their career   in the best way possible . The stories shared in these workshops shall also be available post   a few months on youtube to increase the brand visibility and to target a good footfall   everytime we do this event .

"<NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a student , the first tool I used was a Mind Mapping tool , taught by our teacher . We used   <NAME> <NAME> tool to find a pattern ,   hidden information and access thought process to easily   write up a paragraph or an essay . I often used this as a logical and thorough approach to make   the essay widened and understandable . 

 <NAME> <NAME> is a visual diagram that maps the information using branches and sub - branches . 

 Application 

 We can create a Mind Mapping tool simply by taking a page and a pen . Simply write the main   topic in the middle of the page and start writing the main related information using arrows   pointing towards the middle . 

 I used <NAME> <NAME> on multiple occasions when I was confused about the topic . During   exams , it crucially helped . 

 Insight & Approach 

 This experiment came with help for the thought process . We can easily make up the relevant   information regarding the main topic . We can broaden our minds using a <NAME> <NAME> tool . It   can help our thought process . 

 For me , <NAME> <NAME> is the best approach in design thinking .

"Assignment Rubric - design thinking 

 Challenge & Selection 

 In 2009 my friend <NAME> came to me wanting to launch a brand of clothes that spoke about <NAME> ( a region of northeastern <ADDRESS> ) . However , historically , there were only two brands that did very well in .   has a facility of exporting lifestyle and fashion for being one of the main postcards of <ADDRESS> . In <ADDRESS> , the clothes that were manufactured were usually destined for tourists and did not have a personality . They were just "" souvenirs "" of the city . Knowing this I talked with <NAME> and suggested the application of some techniques of Design Thinking . Initially , we needed to understand the problem from the point of view of our consumer ( empathy ) , and for this we began to look at which brands our target public most liked to use and interact with them to delve into the motives that made them buy these products . We realized that our target audience looked a lot like us and we consumed the same brands from other locations in <ADDRESS> . Knowing this we already had an idea of   how to start to validate the idea by doing a benchmarking with these brands that we consumed . 

 Application 

 As the goal was to launch a brand that spoke of <NAME> , it was natural to start talking about how <NAME> came about , who we were colonized , what people invaded us , and what heritage these people left us . After a very deep research on the history of <ADDRESS> , the ﬁrst collection of the brand with prints of some postcards of the state appeared in stylized form , taking as references the type of design of the brands that we used and put to sell . It was a success ! ! ! 

 Insight & Approach 

 With this we discovered that people loved to wear clothes that showed pride in being from the region and still did not do it because they did not have a more fashionable option . We took advantage of this insight and used this approach to bring our public even closer to the process of manufacturing clothes and stamping some features that only the people who lived in <NAME> knew and liked to be identiﬁed by such characteristics . In this way , the collections have a very strong word of mouth , without the need for large investments in advertising , because the customers themselves make a point of advertasing . Today I also work in a large shopping mall and will use the design thinking to redirect the way of communicating that the mall uses today . After this course , I learned some techniques and application steps of design thinking and especially the strength of storytelling to delight consumer . -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Challenge and selection 

 The principal apparatus I utilized was the instrument of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to   accomplish a mutual comprehension of an issue space among a differing gathering of partners   before endeavoring to distinguish and characterize potential answers for the issue . I utilize this   methodology regularly with our clients , who are government organizations attempting to apply   innovation developments to modernize their strategic the conveyance of their administrations to   their client , which might be <ADDRESS> residents , organizations , and non - residents . I have utilized the   method of utilizing a misrepresentation representation of an issue area with a lot of inquiries or   prompts for conversation to permit a various gathering of partners to gain from one another during   the time spent characterizing the extension , limits , key components , and connections between   components to consider while distinguishing torment focuses and open doors for upgrades or   arrangements . 

 Application 

 I start the procedure by making a misrepresentation realistic of the difficult space . To build up the   misrepresentation realistic , I will draw from any current material accessible to comprehend nature .   The current material might be operational or procedural archives , preparing materials , advertising   materials , GAO or other reviewing reports . In the event that materials are not accessible , at that   point I lead casual meetings with one - three of the partners who fill in as my central matters of   contact on the activity . On the off chance that fitting to the circumstance , I will acquire the idea to   "" front - stage / back - stage "" from past look into , and examined in <NAME> <NAME> 's book , "" The Connected   Company "" . The front - stage / back - stage approach assists with strengthening the idea that each help –   even an inside help – has clients with whom the specialist co - op connects and interior procedures   that empower the association to give the administration . The format I frequently start with   additionally has a segment on the left to distinguish Partners and Value Chain Providers and a   section on the option to recognize <NAME> <NAME> , for example , Congress , GAO , worker 's   organizations , backing gatherings , and different substances that may add imperatives to how the   association works . The misrepresentation realistic is basic , utilizing basic shapes and symbols   accessible in <NAME> or on the Web . On the off chance that the front - stage / back - stage see does n't   work , at that point I will make an alternate kind of visual , either dependent on a significant level   procedure stream with swim paths for various partners , or another organization . For the movement ,   I will isolate the partners into gatherings of 5 - 6 members each speaking to a diverse association or   territory of intrigue . Each gathering gets a banner size duplicate of the misrepresentation realistic   that they can compose on straightforwardly , or utilize clingy notes to offer remarks . I give them two- three inquiries to reply , for example , 1 ) What key components are absent from the realistic ? 2 ) What   might you change about the realistic to make it all the more precisely mirror your difficult space ? 3 )   What key bits of knowledge do you have about the connections between the elements in your   difficult space ? I give them roughly 20 minutes to talk about the inquiries and increase the realistic .   At that point I have each gathering report out on their responses to those three inquiries while   highlighting the imprint ups on their banner . As each gathering reports out , I record shared traits in   the bits of knowledge of each gathering , and afterward extra bits of knowledge that originate from 

 the gathering conversation on an extra duplicate of the realistic . After the meeting , I digitize each   gathering 's banner as a curio , make a view that joins the common and new experiences from the   gathering conversation , and afterward make an overhauled realistic that consolidates their criticism   and proposed changes that they consent 

 Insight and approach 

 What I have gained from directing this activity with a few gatherings is that while the realistic –   particularly the re - examined realistic that consolidates their criticism – is significant for   strengthening their comprehension of the difficult they are attempting to understand , the more   important part of the movement is the mutual bits of knowledge and shared discovering that   happens while they are attempting to characterize their concern space . The realistic gives the   assorted gathering of partners a point of convergence for conversation that permits them to share   their points of view and form bits of knowledge into potential main drivers of their issues . While   they could make the realistic from a clear record in a community way , beginning with a   misrepresentation hop begins the discussion for them . They can rapidly distinguish where they are in   the realistic – or on the off chance that they are missing – and can all the more rapidly increase new   bits of knowledge about connections between key substances rather than setting aside some effort   to recognize them . They can likewise recognize factors in the difficult space – that is , it makes a   difference them to recognize what they do n't have the foggiest idea , in what regions they have to   acquire data or information to give the qualities for the factors . Since I found that the most   important angle is the common experiences and learning , next time I would utilize the   representation action as a beginning stage for a progression of configuration thinking exercises . At   that point the changed realistic that consolidates their joined criticism can fill in as a kind of   perspective device all through the rest of their work .

"Challenge   I study Human Computer Interaction Design in a Technical High   school . We got a praxis project to design a classroom operating   system for universities ( it comes to lighting , dimming possibilities ,   ventilation , devices management and so on ) . The problem was that   the lecturers loose a lot of working time for configuration of room   conditions , affecting the quality of teaching and learning . There   were 5 students in our team and we should visit the maximum   number of university classrooms within a limited period of time for   the purpose of gathering information about the current situation and   requirements of stakeholders of the project . After all interviews we   should make a kind of prototype of this classroom operating system .       Selection   Visualisation is “ the mother of all design tools ” , because it ’s used in   every stage of the design thinking process . On the first stage of our   project we planed some interviews with lecturers from different   universities . Sometimes three persons of our team took part on an   interview , sometimes one , but everybody should gain insight into the   lecturers problems for the future work . So there was a purpose to   share information about visited rooms , devises of these rooms ,   behavior of lecturers with other team members .      Application .    Photography , Video , Drawing . Visualization helped us here : we   made a lot of photos , videos and drew room plans to discus it with   our colleagues by next meetings . “ Photography is a very rich way   for us to understand that world , and not just the people themselves ,   but the context in which they live . Innovation is really centered on   having a rich understanding of those contexts . So things like   photography and sketching can be a very important way of capturing   that kind of information ” , - says <NAME> <NAME> in our lecture .     Sketching . Prototyping   and testing . On the second stage came a   more creative work – designing and namely prototyping of a new   more effective classroom operating system . And here we needed the   visualization tool exactly to “ unlock different parts of our brains -   parts of our creativity , that we might not normally be using in the   course of conversation ” . So we used our tables and color cards to   make diagrams , our whiteboards to sketch our ideas and finally 

 paper , cardboard , pencils and shears to produce a simplest prototype .   Than we went with these handicrafts to our lecturers to test them and   to improve for the next iteration .     Insight & Approach   What I have learned from conducting this project is that photos ,   videos , drawings and sketches are the best tool to share your   experience and insights with your team and with stakeholders , even   remotely .    Videos of interviews help extremely to understand the behaviour of   the people in the surveyed conditions and to see details , that the   people themselves do not realise and can not articulate or express .    And the more times we review it , the more details float to the   surface .      For the prototyping stage is the visualization the indispensable tool   to generate ideas and realize them in practice . The sketches give the   different groups of stakeholders a point for discussion that allows the   project team to make another step to the best solution of the   problem .      What I would add to our project process for the next time is a   graphic of the process itself , that displays phases , status of   execution , next steps . That helps the whole team to keep in touch   with the current developments .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 As a part of CSR activity in my company , I along with my CSR team had visited one government   school . The school was in very bad condition . Teachers were not taking interest in teaching , students   were not doing well , water issues were there and etc . We decided to address those issues by using   Design thinking tool ‘ Visualization ’ . 

 Visualization is one of the essential design tools . It focuses on using imagery to make an abstract   idea more public and more concrete so that it will be more visible , clear and understandable to   others . We chose Visualisation tool as it is equal parts listening , thinking and drawing . Listening is   the input , thinking is the processing and drawing is the output . These three skills work together   equally in understanding complexity , visualising outcomes to create new possibilities . 

 Application 

 In order to design the solution , first we had to build a good understanding of the problem . So we   prepared one form which had a set of questionnaire like what problems they are facing in school ,   what needs to be changed , etc . And we asked Administration and teachers to fill those forms as per   their views . Also interacted with students to understand why they are not taking interest in studies   and why they do n’t feel like coming to school . Then we went through the forms and listed down few   pain points of teachers and few common issues of students . 

 We used Visualization design tool to solve this issue . As the popular saying goes “ picture is worth a   thousand words ” and even a simple sketch can tell us more than a 10 minutes description of an idea .   In a group setting , visualization helped us to spark idea generation . Seeing what other people are   drawing , adding elements to their drawing or simply discussing the sketches helped every one of us   to build on top of each other ’s ideas . Also we used visual props such as nudge cards to stimulate idea   creation which enhanced brainstorming sessions . We used visual tools for prototyping . This visual   thinking technology helped to make different options feel more real to us . 

 We tried to solve few issues by this approach . For poor quality of drinking water issue in school ,   Visualization allowed us to explore many dimensions of problem and to prototype a certain number   of solutions to purify the water . There was no playground for students . So school needs to convince   the municipality to shut down a street to vehicles once a week so that the space could serve as a   playground for students and so they can use it for various activities like dance , art and craft . To solve   problem of Teachers , Administration should support teachers and involve them more in educational   decision making . Washrooms in school were poorly maintained and were unclean . Main reason was   insufficiency of water . So to solve the issue of unclean washrooms , we found that rainwater   harvesting can be done and then that collected rainwater can be used for cleaning of washrooms . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 We saw that <NAME> effectively helped to improve daily operations as well as to enhance both   the in - class and out - of - class experiences for both teachers and students . This approach helped us to 

 build connections between different findings and understand the bigger picture . The visual aspect   triggered idea generation and enabled every one of us to better understand research insights . 

 Really , Design thinking is a human - centered approach to problem solving that serves as a   framework that helps to define problems , empathize with others , develop prototypes of possible   solutions , and hone those prototypes through multiple iterations until they have generated a viable   solution to the challenge at hand . It focused on getting teachers and students to define some of   their biggest challenges , empathizing with them and then work together to figure out solution . I will   definitely use this amazing Visualization tool to solve issues in future .

"Reflection – Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I was working in a petrochemical organization . Coming from an engineering background , I   was often responsible to hold technical conversations during problem - solving or problem   definition phase . A challenge that often crept up during these conversations was the   addressing of the diverse set of individuals . These individuals spanned along different   verticals of the organization , having different educational and experiential backgrounds .   Explaining a problem using heavy technical terms often left a huge chunk of the force out of   the problem - solving exercise . Sometimes , improper understanding would lead to improper   solutions or insights . 

 Selection 

 I chose the visualization tool to come up with more open and understandable ways to hold   dialogue during inter - disciplinary meetings . The universal understanding of symbols and   imagery was employed to bring the group to a common understanding . A more efficient and   swifter problem - solving conversation was expected to follow after the introduction of this   tool . 

 Application 

 I started out by stating the problem ( if identified ) , with minimal words possible . This not   only opened up space for a visual representation but also incorporated the ‘ What is ? ’   approach , where a large chunk of the understanding of the problem lay with the participant .   This ‘ What is ? ’ approach was further emphasized when I presented the challenge in the   process but did not reveal the problem ( if identified ) . It was left to the group to come up   with their definition of the problem , which would be represented by each member in   Process Flow Diagrams ( PFD ) . Members would come up to the whiteboard to mark areas or   sub - processes in the PFD where they thought the problem was likely to occur .   To delve   deeper , we used Process and Instrumentation Diagrams ( P&IDs ) to zero in on a particular   operation or equipment . I used markers of different colours for each team of different   expertise for a better understanding of the process . Finally , to analyse the problem ( or   implement a solution ) <NAME> <NAME> were employed with dependencies . This provided a   clear idea to each team as to when they come in during the entire length of the project . 

 Insight 

 I found this visual approach to problem - solving , rather than merely studying SOP ’s and   Design criteria ’s , helped me reach consensus faster . People were more agreeable with each   other and each participant in the project got equal opportunity to present ideas . Simple   Process Flow Diagrams ( PFD ) helped boil down complex ideas into simple ones for everyone   to understand .   Work Scheduling in the form of charts ( Gantt Charts ) represented   dependency and accountability within different groups better . 

 Approach 

 As stated earlier , I tried incorporating the ‘ What is ? ’ in certain stages within the participants .   This approach can be taken a notch northwards by incorporating tools like ‘ Mind Mapping ’ ,   ‘ Co - Creation ’ , and ‘ <NAME> <NAME> ’ tools . Filtering the jargon used by different expert   groups by symbols could also open up opportunities in co - creation . Understanding the flow   of the process using Visualisation already involves aspects of <NAME> <NAME> but taking it   a step further with incorporating the entire ecosystem of stakeholders would help the   organization work towards a more well thought of the product .

"Branding   &   the   resourceful   mind   mapping . 

 Reflection   on   Mind   Mapping   Tool   ­   My   first   time   on   branding 

 Challenge 

 I ’ve worked as a freelance designer for quite some time now , I think since I was on my third year of 

 college . For every three editorial projects I ’d get one project regarding corporate design , so I 

 definitely was more focused , at that time , on the visuals than on the final functionality of the things I 

 was creating . My process was pretty simple , I ’d create a layout and then get it approved by my 

 client , same thing I used to do for my small corporate design projects , which mainly involved creating 

 deliverables like flyers for an already existing company . The main picture was that I was being a lazy 

 designer , but the fact is I just was n’t prepared enough . I was your basic <NAME> <NAME> , I knew nothing . 

 This story goes back to my first , built from scratch , branding project for an american traditional 

 bakery .   For   which   I   had   to   figure   out   the   following : 

 How   to   get   out   there   and   compete   with   the   local   favorite   bakeries ? 

 How   to   seem   traditional   but   innovative   at   the   same   time ? 

 How   to   become   trustworthy   and   develop   not   customers   but   fans ? 

 Selection 

 So without knowing at the time precisely what I was doing , I fell accidentally / on purpose to the ​mind 

 mapping tool​. I needed to know what the competition was and how to become relevant in a very 

 closed market , what would be the brand differentiator against other companies who had been well 

 positioned for a very long time . So I went with the classic process that ’s done for branding , following 

 the   rules   on   how   to   create   a   successful   brand : 

 1 . Define   the   problem . 

 2 . Specify   goals . 

 3 . Investigate : 

 3.1 . Overwhelm your client with an extensive brief in order to know their expectations , 

 what   they   think   the   personality   of   the   company   should   be   and   detect   basic   needs . 

 3.2 . Investigate   key   concepts . 

 3.3 . Make a through and through benchmarking; for those of you not familiar with this 

 term it refers to the process from which you compile information and gain new ideas , 

 by the comparison between aspects of your company / brand / product with the leaders 

 or   stronger   competitor   of   the   market . 

 4 . Read and translate all the information into relevant facts , conceptual maps , moodboards and 

 more   creative   process .   Establish   the   criteria   and   create . 

 5 . And the rest of the process which focuses more on refining the visuals and building the final 

 face   of   the   brand . 

 Application 

 So during the ​what is ​part of this project , after an extensive investigation , a thorough benchmarking 

 ­ on what already existed on the market in the city my client was going to establish the company­ I 

 was left with huge amount of data I did n’t actually knew how to read … Until I noticed ​patterns that 

 kept telling me the same things . Just like that , while doing things like conceptual maps and 

 comparison charts , all this information gave me a great insight on what was lacking in the market , 

 where were this companies making the same mistakes and how to avoid them . So I built an action 

 plan , about the way the company should work , more precisely I tried to put down into words and 

 sketches what would the company experience be like . The different approaches we could do to 

 attract new customers and maintain them as faithful fans . The main idea was this : host every four 

 months an introduction / tasting event for the season ’s new products and flavours , so this way we ’d 

 maintain our customers on the lookout for every season . Which visually translated into a new pattern 

 per   season   to   accompany   the   main   logo   and   idea . 

 Insight 

 Not only I came up with a visual face for the brand but also with a ­ way more important ­ customer 

 experience . Which inevitably helped me achieve my goals , maintaining a traditional core but still be 

 able   to   be   a   creative   and   innovative   bakery .   <ADDRESS>   call   it   a   win­win .   Hail   Mind   mapping ! 

 <NAME> 

 What would I do different next time ? Well for starters now I know or have a clue on what the process 

 is like so it ’d take less time to develop the idea and translate the information . I ’d follow a more

"Learning Launch Reﬂection 

 Challenge : 

 I am a Senior Manager at a ﬁnancial institution where I am a member of my organizations   learning and development team . In 2010 we took on the challenge of re - imagining our annual   enterprise compliance learning to improve the learner experience . This effort was supported   by conducting a series of focus groups to collect data on learner experiences , preferences ,   and improvement suggestions . 

 These sessions produced a number of possible improvements to enhance and re - imagine the   end - to - end compliance learning experience . The overwhelming suggestions were to reduce   duration of learning courses , and make it personalized to learner .. 

 Selection : 

 When deciding how to proceed , I was immediately reminded of the learning launches video   within this course . As described in the course , a learning launch is a search for the truth , or   the “ one big lie ” as corning glass calls it . Considering the work effort , and cost involved with   reducing the duration of course was insigniﬁcant , and the fact we could potential produce a    “ quick win ” that is easily implemented , we decided to seek the truth and run learning   launches to test and validate the recommendations . 

 Application : 

 Through our internal learning management system , we identiﬁed 50 learners who were all   due to complete compliance learning during the same week within our banking operations   group . This group would serve as our test group . For this group , we removed all non - relevant   content from the online course , and re - wrote the learning scenarios with the physical setting ,   and characters to reﬂect the banking operations group . This resulted in a 25 % reduction of   content , while personalizing the content . We then assigned this new learning course to the   group , with a level one evaluation based on the <NAME> model of learning evaluation . 

 Insight : 

 Through the application of the tool we quickly learned that simply editing content for a   shorter seat time would not improve the learning experience . The feedback was that while it   was improved , it was simply a shorter version of what was currently available . It also opened   our eyes that personalization was not content related , but rather learner related . What the   test group indicated is they wanted dynamic content that was personalized to their individual   knowledge level , not their ofﬁce location . In short The ability to test and disprove an idea or   approach , in such a short time , was immensely powerful . 

 In addition to providing such swift and tangible results , the application and results of this   tool has motivated us to try other design thinking tools . Inspired by the good kitchen story ,   we plan to visit employees at their job , and journey mapped their experience with   compliance learning as it unfolds before us . 

 Approach : 

 I believe that the next time we need to quickly validate assumptions or search for the truth ,   we will use the learning launch tool . This tool has proven to provide swift results and value . It   has also allowed use to test a concept and pivot to another idea . For future problems I would   advocate for multiple concurrent launches to test numerous approaches to solving the   problem , rather than a single launch .

 1 . Challenge   &   Selection    My   company ,   <NAME> <NAME>   has   announced   to   host   a   family   event   for   its   employees   in   Great    America   Park   in   <ADDRESS>   <NAME> ,   CA .   To   add   more   fun   to   this   event   they   declared   a   contest   where    interested   employees   were   encouraged   to   submit   their   videos   online ,   showing   their   individual   or    group   talent   in   any   of   the   activities   such   as   singing ,   dancing ,   instrument   playing   or   magic   tricks    etc .   Among   the   pool   of   submitted   entries ,   top   19   entries   were   selected   and   employees   in   <ADDRESS>    <ADDRESS>   were   asked   to   vote   for   any   one   contestant   ( among   the   19   selected )   in   one   vote   per    employee   fashion .       My   video   entry   for   a   <NAME>   ( Hindi )   song   singing   performance   has   been   selected   among   the    top    19    submitted    entries .    Now ,    my    challenge    is    to    reach    out    to   maximum    of    those    5000    US    employees   and   convince   them   to   vote   for   me .   Only   top   5   contestants   ( out   of   19 )   with   maximum    votes   will   enter   the   finals   with   an   opportunity   to   perform   live   in   front   of   a   large   crowd .   The   official    language   of   business   here   is   English   whereas   my   singing   performance   is   in   <ADDRESS>   language .   That   is    another   barrier   which   I   need   to   cross   while   pursuing   my   colleagues   and   co‐workers   to   vote   for    me .      Among   the   available   options   presented   in   Design   Thinking   for   Innovation   course ,   I   picked   the    Learning   Launch   one .   I   knew   that   if   I   could   engage   with   my   colleagues   and   co‐workers   in   such   a    way   that   it   connects   with   them   then   I   have   my   chances   to   be   in   top   5   contestants .      2 . Application      When   it   came   to   applying   this   technique ,   several   strategies   popped   in   my   head .   I   could   have    printed   post   card   size   flyers   and   distributed   them   in   hundreds   across   our   offices   here .   The   post    cards   would   have   a   common   message   and   a   request   to   vote   for   me .   It   would   not   have   been   a    personal ,   customized   and   a   connecting   message   though .   Most   of   the   co‐workers   who   would   have    received   these   post   cards   would   just   throw   them   on   their   desks   and   forget   about   them .   With    several   other   high   priority   day   to   day   action   items ,   this   would   be   their   ( pretty   much )   last   priority    to   act   on   and   thus   very   easily   forgotten   action .   I   discarded   this   option .      My   second   option   was   to   write   a   common   but   appealing   message   for   all   the   eligible   employees    via   an   e‐mail   and   send   it   through   a   common   group   e‐mail .   Even   this   strategy   would   not   have    succeeded   as   many   employees   who   do n’t   recognize   me   would   consider   this   e‐mail   as   a   spam   and    not   act   on   it .      Then   I   decided   to   go   one   on   one   with   the   employees   that   I   knew   before   and   that   I   worked   with    before   during   my   tenure   at   <NAME> <NAME> .   I   figured   that   instead   of   writing   a   group   e‐mail ,   if   I    address   them   individually   they   may   be   more   motivated   to   go   online   and   vote   for   me .   I   made   a   list    of   co‐workers   that   I   knew   from   before .   Then   I   wrote   individual   tailored   e‐mails   to   each   of   them    addressing   them   specifically .    In   each   e‐mail ,   I   reminded   them   when   I   worked   with   them   before    and   thus   making   it   a   very   personal   experience   as   opposed   to   a   common   group   e‐mail   that   would    have    easily    landed    in    a    spam    or    trash    folder .    In    my    e‐mails ,    I    addressed    them    individually , 

 encouraged   them   to   look   at   my   video   performance   through   the   video   link   that   I   included   and    urged   them   to   cast   their   vote   for   me   if   they   liked   my   performance .   I   also   listed   a   few   key   points    that   they   should   observe   in   my   performance   thereby   guiding   them   to   appreciate   my   performance    truly .      I   think   my   strategy   and   my   tool   selection   is   working .   So   far ,   I   have   sent   e‐mails   to   at   least   200    individuals   and   heard   back   from   at   least   80 %   of   them   with   a   positive   reply .   The   dead   line   to   cast    a   vote   is   October ,   8th ,   2014   and   I   have   many   more   individual   e‐mails   to   be   sent .      3 . Insight   &   Approach    By   connecting   with   my   co‐workers   individually ,   I   could   demonstrate   respect   and   importance   for    each   of   them .   Believe   me ,   it   took   me   a   long   time   to   write   200   separate   e‐mails   with   individually    tailored   messages ,   but   the   success   rate   was   very   high ,   more   than   80 % .   There   were   quite   a   few    revelations   and   learnings   from   this   experience .   Because   my   e‐mails   were   individually   tailored   with    a   correct   message ,   my   co‐workers   were   more   motivated   to   respond   back   to   me   as   opposed   to    the   group   e‐mails .   Thus   the   Learning   Launch   tool   worked .   I   could   engage   with   the   employees   in   a    more   personal   and   effective   way   thereby   increasing   my   chances   of   success .      It   would   be   a   bit   early   to   tell   if   I   could   use   the   same   tool   in   a   different   way   next   time   since   the    results   for   this   time   are   yet   to   be   out .   We   will   know   after   5th   October .   I   am   really   hopeful   that   my    application   of   this   Design   Thinking   Tool   would   bring   me   the   desired   outcome ,   quite   like   the   IBM    story   discussed   in   the   course   video .

"Reflection – Design Thinking 

 The Challenge 

 I work at State Bank of Pakistan , one of the leading telecommunication companies in the world . At we State Bank of Pakistan strive to ensure that the   lives of our customers are greatly impacted whenever they have any form of interaction with the company . The   company has a policy which states that all customer complaints , enquiries , questions must be attended to within 48   hours of when the customer contacts customer service . This is done to delight our customers and retain them as well .   Now , there was an instance where a customer wanted a SIM change . A SIM change usually takes about 24 - hours   tops . For some reason , the customer visited one of our service centers asking for a SIM change , filled paperwork and   provided all the necessary documentation for the process to be completed . However she was asked to come back in   24 - hours , which she complied to . The customer came the next day and again was asked to come the following day   because her information had not yet been verified in the system and therefore a new SIM card could not be issued .   The next day , in order to avoid driving to our service centers and being asked to go back home or return later , the   customer called ahead of time to confirm completion of her request and again , was told she will have to come by our   service center the following day . After 3 days ( 72 hours ) the customer was not only agitated , but also disappointed   and extremely furious with the run around and the terrible service she had received the past couple of days and even   threatened to cancel her subscription with the company . 

 Selection 

 After studying about design thinking and the various tools I decided to adapt the use of storytelling as a solution to   the problem stated above . Design thinking allows one to solve problems by encouraging questions , listening and   having a sense of empathy of understanding towards a person ’s needs and wants . Storytelling is important because it   allows human interaction through the sharing of experiences and providing solution to issues through thorough   verbal and non - verbal communication . 

 Application 

 As the customer displayed signs of unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the service towards my colleague , I felt the   need to step in to assist . I remembered the storytelling tool in design thinking and decided to use this to elicit a lot   more information to resolve her issue . I introduced myself and asked for her name , which she said , was <NAME> . I   asked <NAME> to kindly go with me to a secluded area so I can hear her complaint and assist with resolving it   immediately . Once we arrived at my office <NAME> took a seat and immediately started venting and telling me how   unhappy she was with the service rendered over the past few days . I made sure not to interrupt and allowed her to go   on . While listening , I made sure my body language showed that she mattered , her concerns were valid and she had   every right to feel disappointed with the business . 

 Once <NAME> was done talking , I proceeded to tell her a story of how I experience a similar situation as an   international student in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> of <ADDRESS> ( USA ) . The entire process was so exhausting and during that   time , I felt I was of no value to the company I was willing to pay for in order to have services rendered . My needs as   a customer were constantly being pushed aside and dismissed . Eventually , I was assisted and compensated by the   store manager after I asked to speak to someone in higher authority . 

 After telling my story , <NAME> smiled , sat upright in her seat and said “ wow I thought these things happen only in our   part of the world . ” I then explained to Joana that in every human institution the goal is to strive for excellence   however , there are certain times when things take a different turn like this time . I immediately apologized ,   completed her requested within the next 15 minutes and also compensated her by giving her 100 GB free data . 

 I can say now that <NAME> has now become one of our most loyal customers , which we appreciate very much . 

 Insight 

 By incorporating the storytelling tool , I was able to show empathy to Joana , stimulate the situation and make her   understand that she is valued as a customer and dear to the business and losing her will be a huge loss to us . The tool   also helped establish a positive rapport between Joana and the business , which till date has been very exciting . 

 Approach 

 Feedback and ideas as to how best we can serve our customers in the future will be welcome next time I interact   with our customers . I will also ensure to ask a lot of questions to help recommend new ideas , ways of doing things ,   techniques etc . to management . By asking questions and sharing ideas with management I will also help review   policies regarding our customer service procedures .

"Reflection – Peer - Graded Assignment : 

 Redesigning the Youth ’s Perspectives on Agriculture 

 Challenge : 

 I work in the humanitarian sector at an organization that aims at reducing world hunger and promoting   food security through activities and interventions within the agriculture sector . While outreaching for   participants to one of our agriculture programs , we fell short on recruiting young participants ranging   between 18 and 23 years old . As we needed to meet our target , this was a challenge we had to overcome .   Studying the what is of the agriculture sector in our community , we realized that there are 3 main   stereotypes that might be the reasons behind the lack of interest of the youth in the agriculture sector : 

 1 ) Agriculture practitioners are all poor , uneducated and underprivileged .    2 ) Agriculture practitioners are just for the old .   3 ) Agriculture activities are physically demanding and boring . 

 Breaking down those attitudes brought to my attention that with most of the people interviewed and   observed , those stereotypes emerged mostly from our own representations of this sector : if I ask you to   design a marketing campaign to promote agriculture , what would be the first pitch ? In my community , the   answer has always been the same : photographs of an old man sweating and cultivating the soil , as an old   woman wearing teared clothes carries a ton of seeds over her head . It is all in the images we represent this   sector through . If however , we want the youth to be interested , then we need to show them the interesting   part of story . As an agriculture practitioner myself , I have experienced how agriculture can be fun ,   developmental , and a constructive hobby to a 23 - year - old educated girl like me . The challenge was to   relay this image of agriculture to an audience that have long believed otherwise . 

 Selection : 

 Since my goal has become to break those stereotypes , what calls for changing how this sector is seen by   the community , I have chosen visualization as a tool that would allow me to : 1 ) better communicate to the   young audience who is now immersed in a visual world , 2 ) avoid using words and long promotional   slogans that will turn off the readers , 3 ) allow space for dynamics . I needed to show , not tell . As we learnt   in this course , photography “ is a very rich way for us to understand the world ” and most importantly , in   context . And in order to trigger a new visual approach to agriculture I needed to break the pattern already   dominating in this sector . But what image can defy all 3 stereotypes at once ? 

 Application : 

 Aiming at changing mindset through visualization , I have chosen to change the scenery of agriculture   altogether and I have resorted to another hobby of mine , and combined the two in - reality - very - distant   domains , within the same frame . The subjects of the photoshoot will in fact be dancers : 1 ) dancers are   generally linked in our minds to youth , 2 ) dancers do not belong to any particular class and are not at all   seen as uneducated , 3 ) dance is all about life , energy and fun . 

 The result of this initiative was a set of pictures of young dancers practicing agriculture activities : a   <ADDRESS> wearing her tutu cropping apples on pointe , a salsero lifting a salsera to reach the top of the tree ,   a gymnast spreading the seeds through a grand ecart in midair . So instead of old tired poor man and   woman , we redesigned agriculture and assigned it to the young , educated , middle classed , and those   seeking fun and enjoyment in their activities . The outcome was a significant increase in youth   participation in the phase 2 of the program . 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 This challenge that welcomed uncertainty and risk of a delicate goal that addressed perspectives and   mindsets , confirmed the belief we departed from : visualization is a powerful tool that can influence our   perspective on things . This exercise that followed the course , was a demonstration of the ability of design   thinking to create new paths in situations that have the regularity of a single approach . It has already been   emphasized in the course that visualization can be a tool throughout all the 4 phases of our projects , and   my exercise confirms the role of visualization that I look forward to adopt in my future missions .   Visualization , particularly when it follows strong assessment of the what is and a deep understanding of   the audience and context , is a valuable tool we have to influence and change .

 I am a student studying Electronics Engineering in my degree college . My College offered me a   project having different tasks during different years of my graduation . The objective or   challenge of task during my second year of graduation was to develop an outdoor farm   consisting of various electronic systems as well as automation systems in it . I was working with   a team of diverse individuals and as a team leader the entire designing and execution of this   task was my responsibility . Our work as a team was designing structure of the farm , developing   electronic circuits for the systems , using various IoT modules for creating automated system in   the farm and creating a good environment for plants to grow properly . Our aim was to develop   a working model which will caught attention of project and innovation department and   instructors of our college and keep on adding and improving things in the task by taking   suggestions and reviews from the department . 

 Selection : 

 As our project was having multiple things to design in different areas it was very difficult to   start any area in the task . Another challenge was this designing could have many options having   its own merits and demerits but without having a structure of development it was difficult to   start the project due to uncertainty . To overcome this problem we used design tool   Visualization as this tool helps to verify various option and in understanding the concept of the   problem . This tool gives all possibilities about any option before even implementing it as it   makes us to think deeply in areas and actual problems occurring during execution . 

 Application : 

 We conducted two stages of application of this tool i.e. visualization where our objective was to   initially having a basic structure of the task for having clarity in actual on - field work and to   generate new ideas and new set of options related to various automation and electronic   systems . 

 In first stage of visualization I told my team to visualize about basic structure of the task and   general flow of work and prepare a flowchart . After the work of preparing flowchart was done   we conducted a meeting and discussed the options in all flowcharts and finalized a structure to   our task by taking all possible difficulties also in account . This gave us more clarity to work on   our task and distributing work to all team members became easier . 

 In the second stage of visualization I told my team to visualize about different set of options   and combinations we can use in our task to make it a good electronic and automated project 

 and prepare a document giving details about it . After the work is done we again conducted a   meeting where we collected all the new ideas about electronics and automation systems . Then   we discussed these various options and finalized a set of options or some specific systems that   we wanted to include in our farm . The rejected options in this meeting were not discarded but   they are stored for later use and later betterment of project . 

 Except this we used this tool many times during designing of each electronic system in detail as   it was helpful in understanding problems and key points we were going to face in future while   developing them . 

 Insights : 

 By applying visualization design tool , our team became very much confident in doing the work   because they were already aware about pros and cons of the specific system . As structure of   task was ready due to visualization the initial work was done very faster as all team members   had clarity about their work as they knew what they were creating at the end . When we faced   any problem which we had not visualized at the time of preparation we had set of options   already stored that can be substituted easily . As we have visualized everything it became easy   for us to get our requirements such as circuit boards , soil , digging tools , hardware and other   components time . It also helped us to finalizing approximate budget of the whole task .   Visualization mainly made approach of every team member of our team more practical so we   kept on doing things efficiently and in time with minimum errors . After the presentation of our   task to the innovation department they told us things to emphasize and improved . The   visualization carried out at the beginning of the task helped us even during working on the   same task in future as we have already searched lot of new ideas and raw data which was   helpful . 

 Approach : 

 This course helped me to understand this tool even more which we often use in our everyday   life too for prediction of the outcomes of smaller things . The best thing about this tool about   this tool is that we can use this tool in every stage of our innovation from what is to what works   as it is very natural and easy to use .

"Reflection – Storytelling       Challenge 

 My name is <NAME> <NAME> and I study at the Ankara University , from <ADDRESS> . We 

 have a discipline in the school grade that is based on problem solving , where students 

 propose a common problem in their day to day profession . As my course is Obstetrics 

 ( Midwifery ) , and our group was mainly formed by black women , and the indexes of <ADDRESS> 

 ( my country ) in obstetric violence are bad , we decided to make a booklet to inform these 

 women on how to proceed in case they were victims of obstetric violence . This booklet 

 would obtain information such as government figures to report obstetric violence , as well as 

 how to identify cases of racism in the hospital that they were visiting . The purpose of these 

 booklets that would be distributed in the Brazilian public health system ( SUS ) was to 

 empower black women about their active role in society and how they themselves can be 

 instrumental in changing racism in the public health system . This action is justified because 

 we see from data exposed on Brazilian government websites , public data , that the women 

 who suffer the most obstetric violence are black women .     Selection 

 I ’ve used the storytelling tool , as this is the ability to tell stories using an elaborate plot , 

 using an engaging narrative . As our group is composed only of black women , when we were 

 going to deliver the booklets to black women , we invited them to a conversation , about 

 racism , about life , in an engaging way , so that they felt represented by our history . We used 

 this tool because it is based on identification , involvement , empathy , and that 's all we 

 needed for our project to work , because for these women to listen to us carefully , understand 

 the project and then apply it on a daily basis - day of the hospital experience that they were 

 going to visit ( whether pregnant or not ) , noticed racism ( when it was present ) and could fight 

 it , we had to ensure that the story was being delivered well and that they had understood it 

 completely .       Application 

 We deliver the booklets to health units ( in <ADDRESS> , we call them “ UBS ” ) , located in the 

 city of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . We look for units located in the suburbs ( or favelas , communities ) , 

 because according to the data we researched ( from sources were the places where there 

 were more black residents , including black women of reproductive age . We went to the 

 reception of the obstetric ward and waited for black women to appear . Those who did , we 

 invited them to a conversation about racism x obstetric violence , trying to understand the 

 how much she knew about it , and involving her in storytelling .        Insight 

 We were successful in getting the attention of these women , perhaps precisely 

 because they identified with us , black women . We noticed that most of these women did not 

 know where to report if they were victims of racism and obstetric violence , and many had 

 already suffered violence and racism but had not realized it , thought it was normal . However , 

 some women did not accept the booklets and said they already knew the subject , or were 

 late for the medical consultation . But in general , we were successful in the goal .       Approach 

 In a final analysis , I can see some mistakes we made . As our goal was to empower 

 as many black women as possible about how obstetric violence can be linked by racism , we 

 should have ensured that the women who said they knew the subject really did , perhaps by 

 asking them some specific questions , just to make sure they knew . And those who said they 

 were late , we could have waited for them to finish the consultation so we could talk to her . 

 Every health system has its problems , racism in <ADDRESS> is real , and it is present even 

 where it should be synonymous with health , love , healthy and loving people . But that is not 

 the reality . Even though the majority are black in the country , black women still suffer from 

 their color , and still at a special moment like the birth of a child or a simple gynecological 

 consultation . 

 We are happy to have been able to apply storytelling to involve these women , finding 

 common points in our stories , and bringing them into a world and information , knowledge 

 and empowerment . When we applied this , we did n't know it was a type of DESIGN 

 THINKING , but now we see , how design thinking is present in everything we did with these 

 women .

"Peer - graded Assignment :    Developing a communication strategy from scratch 

 Challenge & Tool Selection 

 As a Corporate Communications Consultant for a large retail and services company I was   asked by the in - house consulting department to create a successful public relations   strategy in order to gain more visibility towards ( young ) professionals . At this point ,   employer branding was poor , the department struggled to find qualified employees .   Conventional human resource activities did not bring the desired success . The idea was to   reach potential consultants through sustainable media relations . 

 First research underlined that this would be a tough project because especially young   people tend to hire at large consulting companies instead of in - house consulting   departments . Another problem was the industry : In <ADDRESS> retail is not very popular   among graduates . I gained these insights by talking to human resource experts at my   company and to members of the consulting branch . The only way to succeed was by telling   compelling stories that will draw the reader ’s attention . 

 I remembered that around two years ago I helped a young consulting start - up to develop a   communications plan by using a tool called The Storytelling Tree which combines both   creative and strategic components . Originally developed for brand communications I found   out that it also works for strategic corporate communications , especially when you start a   business from scratch . Let ’s see if things will work out for an in - house consultancy . 

 The Storytelling Tree is a simple concept , easy to understand but still encompasses all the   different levels that are crucial for communications success . Let ’s imagine a tree with its   four key elements : 

    A Trunk 

    Branches 

    Leaves 

    Roots 

 The tree trunk stands for your company ’s values , mission and your promise to customers .   You have to know who you are and what you stand for . Being certain in yourself is the   foundation of all communication . Here ’s where authenticity comes into play . 

 The branches : Once you know who you are and what you stand for , you start developing   stories . Starting from who you are and what you offer you create strings of stories and   messages . What ’s essential here is that you do n’t just focus on what you want to talk   about , but figure out what your target audience wants to hear . Important : Target audiences   are not necessarily defined by demographics or gender , but – especially online – should be   defined by a common interest . 

 The leaves : Each branch – each story ( or campaign , as you will ) – then grows itself out   into different leaves . The leaves represent the various touchpoints with your target interest   group . For some stories that can be the entire array of communications channels from mail   to print to Facebook to TV to face to face . For other stories that might mean only your   internal communications channels or only your website . The touchpoints matter in regards   of the delivery format of your story , but should not dictate the story itself . 

 Unseen , but the most important part . The roots stand for the internal structures , processes   and culture within your organization . You can try all you want , but if your tree does n’t have   strong roots that are supporting it in its growth and that grow with it , you ’ll fail . 

 Application 

 I scheduled a workshop with five participants from the consulting department , each one   with a different background and career level . The only hardware I used was a blank piece   of paper in poster size , an <ADDRESS> and post - its in four different colours . The participants ,   myself included , introduced themselves , afterwards I described the further process . 

 We started with the trunk and discussed the department ’s values in a very relaxed   atmosphere . At the end of this process we defined five principles such as Family comes   first . We honour employees with children and allow them to work wherever they want ( e.g. ) .    We wrote every single principle on a post - it and fixed all of them vertically - arranged on the   blank poster ( like the shape of a tree trunk ) . 

 After this , we moved forward to the branches : In this phase you develop concrete stories   ( the proverb "" Think Big ! "" becomes a decisive factor ) . To make it easier for the participants ,   I asked them : "" What kind of story about consultancy would catch your attention ? "" It came   out that the group had some difficulties in generating stories so I used an alternative   approach to that question . I told the group to pronounce concrete headlines ( a simple   strategy I learned back in the days I worked for Yellow Press – this is what YP reporters do   before they start their research ) . This tactic worked well : The results were nearly 20   headlines that we also wrote on post - its and then positioned like branches around the trunk   on the poster . 

 Next step : the leaves . This part focusses on the touchpoints with the target interest group .   In the present case I asked the participants if these were graduates or professionals only .   At the end of the conversation we identified additional personas such as internal   employees who are seeking for a new career path or tutors at universities ( who often give   career advises to their students ) . We made a list of online and print media and events , too ,   where we could place our stories . We also agreed that we had to create a portrait about   our company ’s in - house consultancy on the front page of the corporate website . As before ,   we wrote down our thoughts on post - its and positioned them like leaves around the   corresponding branches . 

 Finally we discussed the roots . This part turned out to be the easiest one because the   whole company just went through a huge cultural change process which aimed to increase   responsibility among the workforce . Employees were now allowed to speak individually for   the company . We defined spokespersons / protagonists for individual topics and defined a   clear quality management process . Finally we draw symbolic roots on the poster and   marked each one separately . 

 At the beginning of the workshop we had a blank piece of paper . Three hours later our   communications strategy was complete ! We generated strategic and entertaining stories .   Let me give you an example : 

    Value ( trunk ): "" We succeed together , we fail together "" 

    Headline ( branch ): "" Ten golden rules that consulting newbies should follow "" 

    Touchpoint ( leave ): Business Newspaper for young people 

    Protagonist / Speaker ( root ): Junior Consultant from the team 

 Conclusion & Insights 

 The process was vivid and productive . It seemed that people who mostly think very   strategically welcome little escapes into the world of visual thinking . Diagrams and pie   charts are mostly the only graphical elements they are used to . The drawing of a huge   symbolic tree forced them to leave habitual thoughts behind them – a tree is a living object ,   diagrams and pie charts are not . To gain more results the next time I would organize the   workshop outside the company ’s walls because spatial distance often leads to more   creativity . 

 With the Storytelling Tree we went through the first two stages of Jeanne Liedtkas Design   Thinking process : What is ? and What if ? The next steps would do a small - scale test with a   handful of stories and track the results ( What wows ? ) to finally see What works ?

"Design Thinking for Innovation Final Reflection     The Challenge   Professionals who travel frequently for work and are enrolled in psychiatric therapy are often   not able to book appointments on the weekdays when their psychiatrist is available . These   individuals therefore refrain from the care they need , and psychiatrists lose opportunities to   work with clients . According to an academic study in 2012 , 39 % of Americans travel for work   and 15 % of Americans seek therapy at some point in their adult lives . Psychiatrists lose an   average of 7 out of 30 clients a year due to incompatibility with client travel schedules .      To address this gap , many psychiatrists are adopting telemedicine practices . Psychiatrists offer   services via videoconferencing to provide therapy to clients who travel for work and are not   available for weekday in - person appointments . The use of telemedicine has increased by 40 %   since 2016 , and is becoming a viable solution . However , many practices hesitate to use this   revolutionary method . Teleconferencing is expensive and risky from a data policy compliance   standpoint – it often requires licenses for videoconferencing software that are HIPAA   compliant . Teleconferencing is an innovative solution more commonly offered in urban   environments , but is less accessible in suburban and rural environments . How can a suburban   psychiatric therapist brainstorm ways to innovate and introduce telemedicine methods to   his / her practice ?     Selected Method   In this case study , the selected tool is <NAME> <NAME> –   because suburban therapists are not   generally exposed to industry leaders in telemedicine who can proliferate knowledge about   telemedicine , <NAME> <NAME> will allow them to look at telemedicine with a fresh perspective   and capture any initial thoughts and concepts to address in the innovation process . Therapists   are usually part of a larger network related by competency , insurance company , or region . The   mind mapping process can be applied with a lens specific to any of those networks or applied at   a general level as a foundation .     Application   The core concept in this exercise is “ Telemedicine ” . The first step is to write down words , ideas ,   and/or pictures related to telemedicine , in no particular order and without anticipating a   specific outcome or result . Figure 1 on the next page displays the initial concepts listed in the   exercise .

 Better experience for client   Quality Experience   Less commuting   Complement in - person   sessions 

 Possible changes in session   fees 

 Equipment   Costs   Training 

 The second step is to connect the words in a visual format , with “ Telemedicine ” as the core   concept . This exercise follows a branch format – each branch will have an overarching concept   with multiple sub - contexts attached . Figure 2 is an illustration of the mind mapping exercise .     Figure 2 

 The mind mapping process allows the user to think about various concepts . Here , the concepts   encompass the benefits , disadvantages , and key considerations for adopting telemedicine . Of   all the concepts listed , four were chosen as the main pillars of telemedicine : Quality experience ,   Cost , Data , and Demand .      Suburban therapists ’ primary objective is to provide quality care that effectively carries out the   client ’s goals and improves their quality of life . Some of the concepts listed under this category 

 are conflicting and require additional research . For example , therapists are unsure of whether   telemedicine will increase quality of care due to more frequent points of connection or   decrease quality of care because sessions are more effective when therapists are able to   determine social cues in person that will be harder to discern while videoconferencing .   Therapists must also consider costs to both the provider and the client . Therapists may not be   certain which technologies are required to successfully carry out an online session . In order to   stay compliant , therapists may need to purchase psychiatry - specific softwares that provide a   safe platform for clients to interact – this would increase costs for the provider . Costs for   commuting to the practice would decrease for both providers and clients . From a data   standpoint , health information privacy is a major consideration and would require regulatory   monitoring and additional compliance measures . Finally , there is an obvious incentive related   to patient demand for therapists to adopt telemedicine . Suburban therapists who adopt   telemedicine could be trailblazers in their community and pave the way for such services to be   adopted by neighboring psychiatrists .     Insights   Mind mapping is an effective exercise to list advantages and disadvantages of adopting brand   new technology and change the way therapy is executed in suburban environments . It is a non- judgmental approach where every concept is weighted equally and initial thoughts can form   critical questions and actionable steps . Using this exercise led to questions regarding regulatory   considerations , quality of care , and cost / benefit analysis . If the therapist is part of a larger   organization that hosts a team of therapists , the team can work to prioritize these constraints .   For example , if cost was the primary concept and quality of care was second on an   organizational level , the team can brainstorm key questions surrounding each concept in the   cost category before addressing concepts under quality of care .      It is also important that multiple perspectives are considered , so if the therapist works with   staff members who manage these appointments and patient data should participate and   complete the exercise .     Alternative Approaches & Conclusion   While mind mapping is an effective exercise for adopting telemedicine from a provider ’s   perspective , an alternative approach is certainly possible in this case study . The mind mapping   exercise can also be conducted from the patient ’s point of view . The patient has an entirely   different set of priorities – insurance , access to wifi , and preference of care options are a few   considerations that may be unique to their perspective . The mind mapping exercise should be   completed at an individual level for patients across a substantial sample size . Once those   concepts are collected , they can be aggregated to define what is important to patients overall .   Mind mapping encourages therapist to innovate without diving into complicated details   regarding barriers to innovation . This method allows for therapists to see new ways of   operating and align on a vision before moving forward and creating a strategy .

 are 	   to 	   the 	   business 

 However 	   the 	   key 	   insight 	   was 	   that 	   we 	   have 	   a 	   large 	   customer 	   base 	   all 	   of 	   whom 	    shop 	   for 	   necessities , 	   luxuries 	   and 	   at 	   dining 	   and 	   entertainment 	   venues . 	   Instead 	   of 	    trying 	   to 	   reduce 	   fees 	   to 	   reduce 	   attrition , 	   we 	   could 	   give 	   them 	   a 	   way 	   to 	   enjoy 	   all 	    the 	   things 	   they 	   needed 	   in 	   everyday 	   life . 	   	    As 	   a 	   solution 	   we 	   decided 	   to 	   create 	   a 	   rewards 	   program 	   by 	   partnering 	   with 	    merchants 	   across 	   the 	   country . 	   These 	   merchants 	   ranges 	   from 	   travel , 	   dining , 	    entertainment 	   venues 	   to 	   supermarkets , 	   insurance 	   providers 	   and 	   even 	   healthcare 	    brands , 	   all 	   offering 	   discounts 	   and 	   added 	   value 	   benefits 	   to 	   our 	   parents . 	   	    Building 	   this 	   rewards 	   programme 	   into 	   our 	   narrative 	   showed 	   a 	   tremendous 	    increase 	   in 	   value 	   provided 	   to 	   our 	   students ’ 	   families 	   and 	   built 	   a 	   bond 	   that 	    transcended 	   the 	   transactional 	   nature 	   of 	   the 	   relationship . 

 We 	   were 	   able 	   to 	   tell 	   a 	   story 	   of 	   how 	   we 	   cared 	   for 	   our 	   students 	   and 	   therefore 	    found 	   a 	   way 	   to 	   give 	   back 	   to 	   them 	   in 	   order 	   to 	   enrich 	   their 	   lifestyles , 	   wallets 	   and 	    contribute 	   to 	   their 	   emotional 	   wellbeing . 	   	    A 	   measure 	   of 	   our 	   success 	   was 	   the 	   increase 	   in 	   enquiries 	   and 	   visits 	   to 	   the 	   schools 	    and 	   the 	   number 	   of 	   referrals 	   that 	   began 	   converting 	   to 	   enrollments 	   increased 	   by 	    20 % 	   in 	   just 	   the 	   first 	   six 	   months 	   of 	   the 	   programme 	   going 	   live . 	   	    Approach 	    While 	   the 	   results 	   were 	   very 	   positive 	   – 	   I 	   would 	   do 	   one 	   key 	   thing 	   differently 	   if 	   we 	    were 	   to 	   do 	   this 	   again . 	    Due 	   to 	   a 	   lack 	   of 	   understanding 	   of 	   the 	   Design 	   Thinking 	   process 	   by 	   the 	   wider 	    organization 	   we 	   chose 	   to 	   restrict 	   the 	   process 	   to 	   the 	   marketing 	   team . 	   I 	   would 	   look 	    to 	   including 	   more 	   stakeholders 	   – 	   especially 	   the 	   parents 	   and 	   principals 	   from 	    various 	   schools 	   to 	   participate 	   in 	   the 	   process . 	   This 	   may 	   have 	   led 	   to 	   us 	   finding 	   the 	    insight 	   much 	   faster 	   and 	   given 	   ownership 	   of 	   the 	   story 	   to 	   key 	   actors . 	  	   	    Another 	   possible 	   approach 	   would 	   have 	   been 	   to 	   use 	   ‘ mind-­‐mapping ’ 	   as 	   it 	   may 	    have 	   led 	   us 	   to 	   a 	   more 	   expansive 	   way 	   of 	   thinking 	   and 	   therefore 	   could 	   have 	    possibly 	   generated 	   more 	   creative 	   ways 	   to 	   help 	   solve 	   the 	   problem . 	   	    -­‐end-­‐

"<NAME> <NAME> – Design Thinking Assignment 

 Reflection – Mind Mapping 

 Challenge 

 Last year I started an entrepreneurship with some colleagues . We participated in a contest made   from a big Brand of craft beer in <ADDRESS> , called “ Serum Institute of India ” and as part of the   contest we had to present an innovative proposal to the brand ’s Executive Board . It needed a lot   of information , including a financial model , a marketing plan , an architectural render , a strategy   plan and a project projection . We needed some way to structure everything that was in our minds   in an organized way , and one of the tools to organize all of our ideas so that we could achieve   an interesting proposal was the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . Through this tool , we could sell as best as we 

 could our thoughts and could convince the EB about what we were trying to do . This tool allowed   us to see and to organize the key elements we wanted to show up , and to organize all of our   ideas in a good way , so that everything could be supported and made actual sense . 

 Application 

 We started the process with a mixture of both brainstorming and creating a map or what we   wanted so show . To develop it , we made a list of all the key elements and started relating them   according to their affinity . We used the concepts of an organizational structure that allowed us   to consolidate everything by using lines , symbols , words , color and images , and to convert all   our list of monotonous information into something graphical , colorful and highly organized that   allowed us to gather all our information . 

 After continuous improvement and fulfillment of our map , we could realize what our ideas were   actually pointing to and could manage them to show the most important things of each working   area . For example , part of our proposal was to make a marketing plan . After <NAME> <NAME> , we   could consolidate the following main ideas for our successful plan development : 

 <NAME> <NAME> – Design Thinking Assignment 

 We realized that our ideas converged to five key elements that could give a different experience   to our customers , so that they could live the experience of drinking craft beer in a different way .   As this one , we designed our entire project plan , taking into account the financial , architectural   and management fields . Through <NAME> <NAME> , we could consolidate our ideas as a team until   the point that we could complete our proposal and could share our project in an organized way . 

 Insight & Approach 

 I learned that by using a different tool to organize our ideas , we could articulate everything to   something stronger and so much more structured that also allowed us presenting our project in   a best way . The Mind Mapping gives a group the possibility to consolidate each one ’s ideas in a 

 graph that converges to something greater and united . After doing it , we learned a way to put   our ideas together to achieve a bigger one , and that was something that allowed us to show a   good project we had worked a lot in , so that we could win the contest . 

 For the next time , I think that probably we would use the same tool , but starting with it from the   beginning . We did not were conscious about the importance of organizing our ideas from the   commencement . For the next time that I work in a project related with innovation I will try to   manage my colleagues ’ and my ideas with this from the beginning , since the brainstorming   phase until the graphical phase of consolidating everything on a Mind Map . For sure that is a   really great and useful tool to organize our thoughts , and through that contest and after the   results I realized its importance on innovation .

"Design thinking for Innovation 

 DESIGN THINKING : 

 Design thinking is a process for creative problem solving . Design thinking has a   human - centered core . It encourages organizations to focus on the people they 're   creating for , which leads to better products , services , and internal processes .   Design thinking refers to the cognitive , strategic and practical processes by which   design concepts are developed . Good design thinking is about bringing very   different points of view together . Thinking normally is the 80 % of the time , but for   that , 20 % of the time where we need something very disruptive , very innovative ,   very creative , we 're going to have to put up with a little bit more of the ambiguity .   It force them into a set of rules when we ca n't essentially create an algorithm for   doing them then that makes them hard to outsource and hard to automate , and   therefore more valuable . So it 's things like design and design thinking and it 's   things like narrative and story , which we think is . There 's no single piece of data   that 's going to make it easier . It 's just about trying different things and   experimenting , and trying to move forward towards a solution . We 're never going   to have enough information . We 're never going to have the right information . We   just have to interpret what we have now and do the best that we can . We can use   powerpoint reports , charts to generate ideas from them . And in many cases , that ,   does work for incremental improvements . But if , we want something more   disruptive , you really have to go into the field and , and find something proprietary .   And experience it . We have abilities that are becoming more valuable , because   they have certain attributes to them . There are two types of problems , there are   mysteries and there are puzzles . Puzzles are problems where when you have the   right level of data disclosure , when you have that absolute number , the problem   can be solved . Design thinking solves the problems of customer 's . On top of   helping them approach problems from a customer ’s perspective , design thinking   sets them up to develop more unique and creative solutions to people ’s needs .   Design thinking encourages brands to recognize and remove unconscious bias   when creating customer experiences . With a firsthand view of how people from all   backgrounds use their products and services , companies can gain a complete   picture of their audiences . 

 VISUALIZATION : 

 Here , I have learnt visualization tool as describe as follows . Visualization is about   using images . It ’s not about drawing , it ’s about visual thinking . It pushes us   beyond using words or language alone . It is a way of unlocking a different part of   our brains that allows us to think nonverbally and that managers might not   normally use . When explaining an idea using words , the rest of us will form our   own mental pictures , usually informed by our training . We can present our idea to   us by drawing a picture of it , you reduce the possibility of unmatched mental   models . So getting in the habit of doing visualization is actually a way of   cultivating that side of our brain work . Visualization is really important . For the   process of design because it 's actually a way of unlocking a different part of brain .   It allows us to think in a nonverbal way . Most design thinkers call visualization as   “ the mother of all design tools ” . 90 % of information entering the brain is visual .   Visualization is anything from the things we write on a chalkboard or a   whiteboard . To the images that we create in a PowerPoint presentation , to   photography , video . It 's basically anything that takes us beyond just using words or   language alone . Things like color . Things like symbols for example . The beauty of   using visualization is that we can tap into a single picture . The more we begin to   use pictures , the more that we begin to diagram while you talk , and create a visual   image for people of how we are thinking . Pictures and images enable us to not only   help people understand what it is we 're trying to do , but to help really persuade   them in the worthiness of that particular idea or the strength of , of that concept .   There is an another tool called ‘ Mind maps ’ are used to generate , visualize ,   structure and classify ideas to look for patterns and insights that provide key design   criteria . We do this by displaying the data and asking people to cluster them in   ways that allow themes and patterns to emerge . What I learned from studying this   exercise is , the visualization is used for Design thinkers to think or visualize the   ideas for the problem and gives the proper solution by visualization to reality . I   have referred many of the books , that says , it is a imagination of picture or   visualization that describes the problem and searching for the solution by using this   tool . Design thinkers usually solve problems by using this tool and plays a major   role in design thinking . This tool helps many of the customers to run their business   successfully . They gain profit or loss decided by their design thinking knowledge .

"PBI – Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection         The first tool that I used was a analytics tool , to achieve a shared understanding of projects in our   team to stakeholders and others in our company , attempting   to   identify   and   define possible   solutions to some problems that the project and the assignees might be going through . I have used   the technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts   for discussion to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of   defining the scope , boundaries , key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when   identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions .     Application       I start the process by creating a POWER BI Dashboard , with PBI desktop , connecting a google sheets   file as a source of data , like a data base . To develop the straw man graphic , I will draw from any   existing material available in there to understand the environment . The existing material   may   be   operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or other auditing   reports . If materials are not available , then I conduct informal interviews with one - three of the   stakeholders who serve as my main points of contact on the initiative .     For the activity , I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5 - 6 participants each representing a   different organization or area of interest . Each group receives a poster - size copy of the straw man   graphic that   they can   write   on   directly , or use sticky notes to make comments . I   give   them   two- three questions to answer , such as : 1 ) What key elements are missing from the graphic ? 2 ) What   would you change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space ? 3 ) What   key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities in your problem space ? I   give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic . Then I have   each group report out on their answers to those three questions while pointing to the mark - ups on   their poster . As each group reports out , I record commonalities in the insights of each group , and   then additional insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic .   After the session , I digitize each group ’s poster as an artifact , create a view that combines the shared   and new insights from the group discussion , and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their   feedback and proposed changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach     What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic –   especially the revised graphic that incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their   understanding of the problem they are working to solve , the more valuable aspect of the activity is the   shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem   space . The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them   to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems . While they   could create the graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner , starting with a straw man jump   starts the conversation for them . They can quickly identify where they are in the graphic – or if they are   missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of   taking time to identify them . They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is , it helps   them to identify what they do n’t know , in what areas they need to obtain information or data to provide   the values for the variables .     Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning , next time I would   use the visualization activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities . Then the revised   graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference tool throughout the   remainder of their work .

 The challenge is the sale of locally produced goods in <ADDRESS> . This is a challenge because   goods produced locally need to be sold internationally and since it is not easy to do so ,   producers find it difficult selling their products on the local market to make maximum   profit . 

 2 . Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what it is 

 and why you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture   references ) . 

 I selected <NAME> <NAME> tool to help in finding a solution to this situation . Mind mapping   helps to think , collect knowledge , remember and create ideas . A mind map is a graphical   way to represent ideas and concepts . It is a visual thinking tool that helps structuring   information , helping you to better analyze , comprehend , synthesize , recall and generate   new ideas . Mind maps can be created in many different ways , but they share the same   basics . Mind mapping is very critical to the design thinking process . 

 3 . Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge ( e.g. , 

 what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 I collected information to understand the challenge to understand “ what is ” and to identify   “ what if ” . I collected information from several players that are involved in producing goods   locally and marketing and distribution agencies . I then identified all the insights in the   information gathered and uncovered what its implied . This helped me to understand the   challenge and arrived at a solution . 

 4 . Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your 

 challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about   design thinking more broadly ) . 

 It has helped me to understand the mind mapping tool and how to use it . In my view ,   mind mapping is the best to use in design thinking . It should therefore be used to find   solutions to any problem . 

 5 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same 

 tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 When using this tool again , I would gather most of the stakeholders together to gather   information and find solutions to any challenge being faced . This will help find solution   in time .

"Reflection : Mind Mapping 

 Challenge and Selection 

 Teaching new concepts , especially complex processes and ideas can be challenging when dealing with people from different educational backgrounds . Sometimes , teaching involves planning , which is similar when planning for a project , this time , the project is to convey concepts and ideas to people who might have different assumptions on the lesson topic . 

 The tool I usually approach is mind mapping as a visual tool which clarifies ideas and communication . It helps to learn , understand , identify , comprehend and come to conclusions . I teach my students a concept so they can visualize the process of the concept and recall the information better . Also , complex ideas and concepts can be made easier with mind mapping . It is also a flexible tool , which improves creativity , productivity and teamwork at the same time . 

 Application 

 I start the process by writing the main topic in the center of the mind map . Then I brainstorm topics to create branches from the main topic . We draw   different lines that connect the main topic to these topics . Every student is allowed to write about these topics . When several topics have been created , and we debate on them , we start to elaborate subtopics on these topics , adding just one or two words , or maybe a very brief phrase . 

 When all these subtopics are written , we again debate on them and rearrange them , making sure that every subtopic is under the correct topic . We use different colour markers to underline or circle the related subtopics . In this way , students start to connect ideas related to the main topic in the center of the mind map . When the subtopics are tagged with different colours - circled or underlined - we start   by making questions to analyze the ideas , tasks and concepts connected . 

 Insight and <NAME> 

 What I have learnt from conducting this activity with several groups and people is it makes meaningful learning , as they acquire new knowledge and they connect these knowledge , meaning , this concepts to previous knowledge and concepts . The retain the new information longer , and faster and better and it ’s really engaging , as all students are involved in the process of brainstorming , generating ideas and connecting concepts . 

 I found out that brainstorming and visualization helps students to develop ideas and concepts before teaching the main core of the lesson so next time I would start with mind mapping as first activity so they start to generate and brainstorm their ideas and I can get to know their background and help them to connect these ideas to the new ones .

"EXAMPLE REFLECTION - VISUALIZATION 

 CHALLENGE & SELECTION I am a freelance business design consultant . I employ design thinking techniques with   business model design frameworks to create people centric innovations . I was hired to   assist a local fast growing , nation wide , high - end bakery chain in developing a new   product to meet with the increasingly challenging market competition . The market   landscape was stagnant with the same repertoire of products . New entrants would simply   reproduce the same products over and over again , turing the market into mainly a price   based competition , oﬀering similar in quality products under diﬀerent branding . My ﬁrst   challenge was to convince the top management of the company to employ a people   centric approach and not the usual production focussed systematic approach that they   usually use . After long deliberations , I managed to convince them , under the promise that   the approach will be a low cost and fast“experiment ” with eye opening insights .   The ﬁrst tool that I used was Visualization . Customers are people . People prefer to see   than to read . that was my assumption . It makes it easier for them to understand the   dimensions of a choice . After a quick review of the market , we decided to focus on an   under served segment : Children . 

 APPLICATION I designed sort of a visual survey made out of 10 segments . Each segment is composed   out of two pictures . There were no questions , just two pictures portraying two different   situations . For example , one picture would show a child , aged 3 to 5 years old happily   eating vegetables ( broccoli , carrots , beats , etc … ) , versus a picture with a child in the same   age turning away from vegetables . Another example , a child happily and energetically   playing versus one with a child sitting and not doing anything . With a small team of   university interns , we went to social sporting clubs and met with mothers . We offered them   the pictures and asked them to choose the pictures that most likely described events/ situations occurring in their daily lives with their children . We made sure that we did not   interrupt them or inﬂuence them in any way . We also made sure that the group of mothers   we approached were diverse and covers a wide spectrum of mothers types ( i.e. , from least   to very protective , from least to very relaxed ) . We then asked them for their contact   information and whether or not they would like to be contacted later on . 

 INSIGHT   The very ﬁrst insight we uncovered was that children did not like to eat vegetables , and   that mothers were struggling to convince them to eat vegetables . The second insight was   that most mothers somehow are looking for ways to better interest their children to eat   better . We dedicated our eﬀorts to design a second round of testing by contacting some   of the mothers and asked them if they would like to share with us some stories about   their daily feeding interactions with their children . We wanted to conﬁrm the insights we   ﬁrst gathered with stories from the ﬁeld . We created a portfolio of stories that helped us   better understand the dynamics of eating habits of children and their interests in eating .   We understood that taste is a key factor , however the colours and textures of the food   itself is key to the ﬁnal decisions of whether or not a child would eat a certain type of food   or not . 

 APPROACH   I believe that using visual pictures was successful in showing the importance of the   people centric element in designing a product for the top management of the company . 

 They managed to see the emotions behind the decision making of selecting a certain   product versus another . However , next time , I would chose to make the pictures oﬀered in   a sequence of stories and not simply random . Combining visualization and storytelling in   one single test could be an even more powerful tool in understanding the “ people ” behind   the “ customers ” .

"Design Thinking for Innovation- Mind Mapping 

 Challenge-   Mind mapping is an interesting tool that helps me to represent my ideas and plan   systematically before work . Since it is a group activity it also helps me to improve   my relations and understanding with my colleagues in college . I am a part of a   team that manufactures an All - terrain vehicle . We participate in a national level   competition which is organized for undergraduate students . In 2017 our team   stood 12th in our country and now we have started preparation for 2014   competition . Before starting the design of our new vehicle , I suggested my team- mates to use the mind - mapping tool . We all arranged an online meeting during   this lockdown . Our competition has various sub - categories like design , sales ,   cost , technical inspection and dynamics , and sub - systems like transmission ,   suspension , steering , brakes , chassis , and DAQ . Our challenge was to identify our   shortcomings during last year and come up with out of the box thinking . I   suggested my team - mates use this tool so that we can identify in which sub- category we need to put more effort , proper distribution of man - power , and much   more . The linking tool of mind - mapping helped us identify which task to do first   and which later .     Selection-   Up till 2017 , our team had sub - systems . We divided our team into sub - systems   and all system members took appropriate decisions about their work and all the   system leads reported their plan to the captain . This is also a good approach where   a proper division of labor is followed but there is less interaction with others and   less scope for creativity and imagination . So , we followed the mind - mapping   technique where all 40 team members sat together and shared their views in all   aspects . It also helped everyone to know about each other ’s work and help them   progress with everyone ’s ideas .        Application-   As I discussed before we had an online meet during this lockdown before we   could get distributed in systems . We chose a topic one by one . For example ,   design . A number of ideas came up under “ design ” like four - wheel drive or rear- wheel drive , suspension geometry , brake biasing , bracket design for system   integration , validation setups , etc . I noted down all ideas under design .   Subsequently , we went on to other challenges that we faced in various events of   sales , cost , technical inspection , and dynamics . After that , we linked all ideas with   arrows indicating the order of completion . 

 Insight-   As discussed above , the ordinary method of working like every year in the   “ Selection ” part , I was restricted only to my system ideas of chassis . But this   mind mapping helped me to understand other systems too . I was also delighted   to give my ideas to the cost team . This activity helped me to develop an   interdisciplinary approach and creativity . 

 <NAME>   <NAME> - mapping is a tool that helps to explore ideas and represent them on board .   It was definitely a good activity to improve team - bonding . I hope that the ideas   we shared and planning we did using design thinking tools helps my team achieve   a better rank in the 2014 competition . If I am asked of using another design   thinking tool I will use “ Story - telling ” . I will use this tool to tell the stories of the   hardworking team members who have completed their graduation and left the   team . Telling the stories of their hard work and sacrifice to the new recruit   members will help them to inculcate discipline in their work .

"Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I work as part of a sales team in a web hosting company . My goal is to help my team connect to as many   customers who had visited our site with a purchase intention and help converting them into our   customers .   There is a tremendous increase in the number of people going online since lockdown and   the covid situation and hence there are fewer people and many people to call . We need to find out a   way to improve the pace and productivity . 

 Selection 

 I had the idea to use the learning launch tool . I hope that we can use this tool to find a solution quickly .   This is also the first time that we will try to practice a Design Thinking method . 

 Application 

 We meet and discuss what we should do or how we should proceed when a problem of the increase in   the number of calls . We all agreed that in such cases we need a "" backup "" that helps us in this kind of   situation , so that at least one person can be delegated to deal with the people who were checking lower   value products online . We have decided that we want to train a minimum of 5 people . The contact   person will always be the person on early shift . Finally , we have created a document with all the basic   queries and also made price sheets with all the possible prices for every product so that no one is   wasting any time unnecessarily . 

 Insight 

 We have partly achieved what we wanted to achieve . The people who are in the team and the extra   trained people could answer more calls than the team without backup before starting the experiment .   The only thing we did n't consider was that the people who helped us and were taken away from their   main teams were also missing and as a result there was more work in the other teams . 

 Approach 

 As it was , as I have mentioned , the first Design Thinking method we used , I think we learned a lot from   it . For the next time , we will have to think about the impact in other teams that our decisions will have .   The performance in other teams should not go down just to "" save "" our team performance . 

"
"Challenge 

 I am a member of the product development team in my company . We are “ shared resources ”   that support projects for all different parts of the organization . We usually take part in these   projects as part of a multidisciplinary team as project managers .   In one of our recent projects ,   led by the sales organization , we had the objective of increasing the adoption of a certain sales   tool . We use this sales tool in our shops to present , review , collect and sign all required   documentation ( e.g. contracts , IDs … ) in digital format as opposed to physical format . We knew   that we had a low usage rate but we did not know much more . We did not know which issues   the tool had nor how to prioritize them . We also had the issue of presenting information to   our stakeholders in an accessible way , not as a huge report 

 Selection 

 We decided to use mind mapping as a tool to achieve a common understanding of the   situation , identify pain points and their root causes and agree on the drivers that were   conspiring against the adoption of the tool . To do so , we built the ideal customer journey our   customers follow in our shops and contrasted it with all the different real world cases that we   found . This would help us identify the real issues as well as to build the design criteria for   ideation . 

 Application 

 We started by immersing ourselves deeply in the problem . To do so we interviewed 10 shop   clerks to understand their point of view . We visited and observed 3 shops ’ activity for 2 days .   We also asked real customers about their experience of the sale process and using the sales   tool . We then interviewed the IT people in charge of the tool to understand what was   happening behind the scenes for all the different cases that we have found in real life . 

 We then built our customer journey map in a large wall - sized panel and divided it in three   rows . On the top row , we placed the ideal customer journey , the step - by - step process that   showed how a customer proceeds to a purchase and how the sale is finished in the shop . In   the second row , we used sticky notes to lay out all the knowledge that we had gathered from   the different steps when using traditional documentation ( physical format ) . In the third row ,   we did the same exercise but this time with the digital documentation . For both rows we   recorded all the relevant pieces of data that we had gathered during our research : issues   encountered , what made our customers happy , what made them nervous , how much time did   they spend in - store , what did our sales reps did with that documentation , what our sales reps   told them during the process … 

 We then run a workshop with sales executives to identify and agree on the issues that we   wanted to tackle with the project . We started by introducing the workshop and what we   expected from them . Then we let them inspect the customer journey and all the pieces of data   silently for 45 minutes . We asked them to summarize any learning that they thought was   relevant using sticky notes to ensure that they kept it brief . Then , we used a similarly sized   panel opposite to our customer journeys to put all our sticky notes . 

 During 30 minutes , we clustered all similarly themed insights in groups that we proceeded to   summarize . We also connected those clusters that we thought had a relationship among them .   Finally , we discussed the different clusters during the next hour in which we uncovered the   insights behind the themes . We used the “ so what ” technique described in week ’s three video 

 “ mind mapping tool ” to force the group to think deeply of the implications of the observations   and the theme of each cluster . 

 Insight 

 The most striking outcome was the diversity of the insights that we got . The resulting clusters   were in many cases “ human ” issues that we needed to solve to drive adoption ( e.g. sometimes   the sales rep did not know how to use the tool , customers did not know most of the time why   they were giving their IDs … ) . However , we also discovered some technical issues that the   company was not aware of ( e.g. sometimes it took more than 10 minutes to upload the   documentation ) . Ultimately , what made the exercise very rich was that we also unearthed   some positive aspects of the current solution that customers and sales reps liked ( e.g.   customers loved that the process seemed safer , when it was fast it was preferred to the   traditional process … ) . This enabled us to develop a richer solution not only focusing on fixing   issues but also extending the aspects that everyone loved . 

 The ability of mind mapping to be used to not only gather issues but also positive points and   link it to their deep meaning makes it a great tool . The executives that attended the workshop   were enamored with the results . They have asked for the involvement of design thinking in   other projects raising the visibility of the technique and the profile of our group . 

 Approach 

 In retrospective , I was too focused on the issues that we needed to fix during the introduction   of the workshop . Only through the initiative of the attendees , we were able to also point to   the positive pieces of feedback that we have received . I believe we picked the right tool for the   job , but next time I will focus on learnings when presenting the objectives of the workshop and   not on issues . I believe this will encourage the team to pick all relevant feedback ( positive and   negative ) that may help us enrich the solution .

"Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 I am working in technology company and providing software solutions to the retail banks . My role is sales and   relationship management with key accounts in the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> region . Being in technology company we   often need to launch new solution to the market , where for that particular client it may be challenging and   are afraid of changes and new technologies . 

 Even though my clients are eager to try new things but they want to have a proof that it already works and   what is the implementation journey for them . It is always difficult when launching new solution to the market ,   for several reasons . Implementation team on the client side does n’t have experience and knowledge how to   handle certain situations . They are skeptical of efficiency that this particular solution will work and how it will   be maintained . For this reason , I very often use storytelling approach to share the experience from the other   markets on particular cases which might be relevant for my clients . 

 Application 

 I am regional sales manager for the <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> and responsible for the client relationship management ,   I have access to the knowledge and information how my peers are implementing certain products and what   are lessons learned from these implementations . 

 I wanted to launch new module of risk scoring solution for the Credit cards in one particular market . The   solution is relatively new however , it is very efficient in managing risk scoring for the Credit card portfolio and   recent implementation in other markets demonstrated excellent results . Even though , I was n’t directly   involved in the implementation process , I had quite a lot insight . 

 When I was discussing credit scoring solution implementation with my clients , they were very interested but   shared their concerns regarding managing certain workstream with the system . Luckily , I recalled previous   experience on the different market and I explained and told them the story how the implementation was held   there , how this issue was managed and resolved . 

 Insight 

 Storytelling was very efficient in my particular case . The bank who shared their concerns regarding the   implementation process and thought it would be unique to their particular case , was n’t so . As I had a similar   story for them to share , which other clients had experienced and discussed the implications and experience   of other to them . This helped a lot to everyone . First , bank became relatively optimistic and certain that they   needed the solution . Secondly , they realized its not only them who have such concerns , but others and they   can leverage and learn from others experience . 

 I discussed this matter with my manager and what was the outcome of this situation . There are couple of   sales manager in my regional team who work with the clients implementations . We agreed that we would   prepare case studies and share on - going basis our experiences with the clients , sharing experiences will help   us in the future to support our clients and share the stories of other client from different region and best   practices . 

 I am working in technology business focus on retail banking . This course helped me understand that every   business foundation is human to human interaction and all the approach we take doing our jobs , we should   be coming from the human centered and what would be suitable for them and comforting their minds . 

 The tools I have learned , will help me understand and deepen in to the issue and problems I am trying to solve   on the daily basis , by interacting with my clients . 

 I usually use story telling technique which is closer to my business and more needed .

"Challenge & Selection 

 The tool that I used is <NAME> <NAME> . I and my teammates work with underprivileged population   who have financial problems to get nutritional foods . We had to identify why are they financially   unstable . Is it because they are wasting their earned money or they do not have a job and etc . We   used mind mapping because we need to identify the patterns in our data which is to identify their   unmet needs and pain points . 

 Application 

 We spent our time looking for secondary data , since we were under lockdown due to <NAME> ,   about the impacted stakeholder group .   Once we have gathered all the related information , we will   conduct meeting to find solutions based on the data we collected . Each of us must find two pain   points . Then , we will share those pain points and cluster them if they are related as stated in Mind   Mapping video in this course . We make use of the clusters that have been developed and come up   with various strategies to try and find a way for it to function . 

 Insight & Approach 

 By applying the mind mapping tool , our team identified their pain points and made sure we can   develop a strategy that will be pain reliever . The tool provides us with a focal point for discussion   that enables us to share and develop insights into possible root causes of the pain points . What we   found out was that most of them are unable to provide nutritional food to their families because the   money they earned are used up for medical check - ups or education of their children . 

 I will use the mind mapping activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities in the   future . The revised graphic which integrates the pattern of data and how each point are   interconnected will then serve as a reference tool .

"Design Thinking for Innovation Assignment 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge : I was preparing for my CFA Level 1 exam and it was getting difficult for me to grasp the   concept of Mortgage - Backed Securities ( MBS ) . I was getting confused regarding the entire deal flow ,   as to how the money exchanges hands among banks , customers , investment banks and credit   default swap providers . 

 Selection : The tool that I selected to help me understand <NAME> better was the visualization tool . The   tool would help me get a pictorial representation of the flow of money amongst the concerned   stakeholders , and understand why the flow is taking place . 

 Application : I used the visualization tool to first sketch all the concerned stakeholders . I then drew   arrows to help me understand how money is passed from one hand to another . Beside each   stakeholder , I drew in simple terms their reason for the transaction . This helped me gain a clear   picture of <NAME> . 

 Insight : I learned that pictures help one gain a better understanding of a particular concept and that   they stay in our memory for a longer period of time . I also understood that its easier to recollect   pictures than words . 

 Approach : For every concept I do n’t understand henceforth , I will make charts , graphs , sketches and   icons to help me gain a better understanding of the concept . I would also look at various videos for   the concept that can help me gain a better understanding .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 My company is an industrial services provider in the oil and gas and energy sector .   Providing solutions that   resonate with the customer needs is in the core of our business and to do so we always visit our customers   when we get a business inquiry from them to hear about their specific needs , the problem they are facing   and based on this feedback , we can decide which of our services is most suitable to satisfy his needs .   All   throughout our project cycle , we work closely with the customer so we get live feedback on our performance   while providing stories of our successes with previous customers to ensure the customer of our ability to fulfil   his business needs and to build positive relations with him which connects to future opportunities . 

 Application 

 We had a business inquiry from a client who owns a petrochemical plant and had a scheduled shut down for   a critical part of the plant for maintenance activities . After visiting the part of the plant that was to be shut   down to better understand the scope , we sat down with the client for a meeting to get more details about   the difficulties they are facing to see how best we can support them . 

 The client was a little hesitant about hiring us so we shared a recent success story in a sister company of   theirs .   We explained the scope our job and how we maintained constant contact with that client which made   us execute the job to the client ’s satisfaction .   We also shared data about our equipment and invited them to   visit our company to inspect our readiness . 

 Insight & Approach 

 The client really appreciated our dedication to his cause and how relatable the story was to him .   Our   transparency also helped tip the scales in our favor .   Throughout the project we made sure we were   communicating with the client on a daily basis to tackle setbacks and challenges and their feedback at the   end of the project was very positive . 

 This course made me put storytelling into perspective . It made me think back on those times our   communication with the customer was rushed and not thorough and as a result our job performance was   poor because we were not clear on the customer ’s needs .

"Reflection - Mind Mapping 

 1 . Challenge 

 My job position requires me to collect data from different operating regions each year for 

 reporting purpose . Different types of data are collected and involve many different departments 

 and up to 100 colleagues . Our challenge often lies in the collection of data within a short 

 timeframe and further processing the data for further validation . This year , my department 

 wants to develop an online database system ( ODS ) to collect data for the convenience of our 

 regional staff . The project scope involves developing an online data system from scratch . We 

 want to try to find solutions as to how we can automate data collection and processing 

 procedure and uncover user preference , needs and habits while also meeting the data 

 validation , analysis and reporting requirements . 

 2 . Selection 

 To help identify the essential functions and navigating features of the online database system , 

 mind mapping technique was used . Mind mapping is a useful tool which can help facilitate the 

 search for patterns and themes of our stakeholders to shape the fundamentals of our ODS . 

 Through mind mapping , the team could reach common understanding towards a user friendly   and operable user interface . 

 3 . Application : 

 My team worked on producing a mind mapping exercise to help us identify needs for the ODS . 

 Before the exercise , the team already had knowledge on the ODS and was given a brief 

 introduction on the background of the mind mapping exercise . We placed a large blank sheet in 

 the middle of the table . We then wrote ODS as our main topic in the middle of the blanks sheet . 

 Then we drew branches and thought of adjectives that would describe our ODS ( e.g. simple , 

 usable , easy , compatible ) . Next , we started to draw sub - branches and elaborated on the 

 adjectives and brainstormed for features , designs and methods which can help to achieve the 

 identified adjectives . We made use of colours and visuals to help explain the concept better . 

 After the mind mapping exercise , we started to analyse our thoughts by grouping similar 

 concept together . For example , for adjective “ easy ” one of the keywords in the sub - branch was 

 “ links ” and for adjective “ simple ” one of the keywords in the sub - branch was “ menu ” . The two 

 features all point out to the concept of easy navigation . The analysis exercise helped to create a 

 list of main concept , design features and functions in the ODS . The team then used this list to   discuss with our IT department and programmer on the requirements . 

 4 . Insight and <NAME> 

 By applying mind mapping tools , it helped the team drill in depth on the topic and identify 

 hidden problems and risks that may have been neglected before . Mind mapping allowed the 

 team to visualize the online platform through the use of word , images , numbers , symbols and 

 colour . It helped draw inter - relationship between different sub - branches and while we started 

 to diverge and create branches along a topic . We ended up converging our thought around a 

 certain concept / theme , helping us define and prioritize our goals while moving forward . In the 

 next stage , our team will review the results from the mind mapping exercise and incorporate 

 into the ODS . I found that using graphics and colours during mind mapping particularly useful . 

 As the saying “ a picture is worth a thousand words ” , one is able to observe many details and 

 hidden messages through drawings and adoption of colours . 

 Mind mapping is an exercise that can aid the thinking process as it allows the brain to radiate 

 different thoughts and ideas instead of traditional linear thinking . It can help identify risks and 

 needs in which the results are useful in planning and overall project management .   Next time , I 

 will add an empathize stage after this exercise . I would invite relevant stakeholders for a 

 workshop to understand their online navigating patterns through direct observation . Direct

 Storytelling Applied as Design Thinking Tool to Solve a Challenge : 

 Monocultural v Bicultural Education 

 Challenge . 

 A school always is a place for debates and difficult , challenging decisions . 

 Imagine a school where , there is many stakeholders all with different goals :   the   teachers , the upper administration , the parents , the regulations that must be complied   with and the main stakeholder , the student whose opinion is , in general , the least   considered .   Now , let ’s add an additional issue :   In schools with a high population of   English Language Learners , like Bandung Institute of Technology in <ADDRESS> , a Dual Language Enrichment   ( DLE ) model is offered .   Unfortunately this program can be declined by the parents , now   that they are in the <ADDRESS>   This model is only offered up to 5th grade .   Although the   bicultural benefits have been extensively demonstrated , still some parents insist in their   children attending “ English only schooling ” .   The challenge is to demonstrate the   parents how the DLE model , a bicultural education approach can benefit their   student(s ) .

 Selected Tool :   Storytelling . 

 We believe storytelling is the perfect tool to overcome this challenge .   Storytelling 

 results will   establish a trusted relationship which gives access to the listener of a   message paying more attention to the emitter of that message , given some conditions . 

 Application . 

 Commonalities like their language -most parents speak only Spanish- , the place 

 they were born , their experience as migrants , etc .   Storytelling in this case has involved   sharing my experience as a bicultural immigrant student myself , if I know the location   they are from or if I have been there , the kind of food we like and eat , how I became an   immigrant , how knowing two languages helped me gain a better job in the <ADDRESS> , etc .    This empathic approach has been very successful in the parents being not only more   understanding of the situation but also a better student - teacher relationship which   facilitates the learning process .   This approach went beyond its initial goals of showing   the parents that a bicultural education could be the best choice for their child and having   an impactful effect the whole school year . 

 Insight gain . 

 <NAME> is a powerful tool , however , this fact is not as evident as when the 

 tool is applied and the behaviors and performance of the scholars   both all along and at   the end of the school year come back and are analyzed .   At least for me , who have an   engineering background , the first approach is number oriented not people focused . 

 Approach . 

 The more you do <NAME> , the better results you obtain , with decreasing 

 benefits the more time it is done .   Unfortunately , teachers have limited time and   sometimes around 100 students divided in four sections .   “ Problem pupils ” can take up   much more time than the average student .   So I would not change the tool , instead I   would further refine the current tool to the particular configuration of the unique set of   variables a given school year deals us .

"Assignment : Reflection_Storytelling 

 1 . Challenge : As a team member of Tax Accounting Unit , in which one of our 

 responsibility is filing of all taxes withheld by the retirement funds and remit it to   the Bureau of Internal Revenue in an accurate and timely manner .   When the   bureau introduced and implemented their online filing system , maybe one of their   goal is to easily identify and monitor each taxpayers if they are complying with the   rules and regulations being implemented . Also if the taxpayers are filing and paying   applicable taxes on or before the deadline . It was a big challenge for us because   we are handling about 900 accounts and each account have 2 kinds of taxes to be   filed every month . In the implementation , the BIR requires all taxpayers to provide   proof of filing to avoid incurring of penalties . Given on our situation that time , that   using a tool that will generate BIR forms regardless of the volume in a shorter turn   around time and submitting the hardcopy to the BIR and instantly we already have   the receiving copy as our proof of payment . But now , in online filing , it will take time   because we will have to encode each account and we can not do anything because   it is not our system and what we need to do is to have a confirmation receipt   monitoring . 

 2 . Selection : I think the best tool appropriate with this challenge is <NAME> . 

 What it is and why ? Because , before the implementation of this online filing   system , of course there is also an existing processes on how they do the filing and   how many personnel needed for this task , given the high volume of accounts   involved , Some of these questions are How do they file manually , How much time   do they need to meet the deadlines , Are they using tool or process to make it fast ,   How it is being submitted to BIR and How many personnel they needed . A lot of   information to be asked and to be provided in order to come up with a solution .   And that is why storytelling is best in this challenge . 

 3 . Application : By asking relevant questions that are needed to come up with the 

 best solution and new process the way it is required in the new filing system . For   example , by asking how manual filing is being done ? Then , an information about   their process will be provided , that after the completion of report , they are using a   tool that can provide one time generation per type of BIR forms regardless of the   volume , then the officer can already sign the forms and then personnel from the   team do the photocopy . And then another personnel will submit the original and   photocopy to the BIR and then , the BIR will stamped “ received ” the photocopy and   that copy will serve as the proof of filing . From this information , we can validate   that in manual filing , the taxpayer would likely meet the deadline regardless of the   volume . While in the implementation of the online filing , it is favorable to both but   there is a big challenge for unit who handles high volume of accounts with limited 

 resources . Because in online system , it should be filed in the BIR system in per   taxpayer TIN and per type of BIR forms . It means that in our case , we handle 900   accounts and 2 types per account every month so we have to file a total of 1,800   accounts per month and it will require more time more personnel to do the task . A   good internet connection is also a big factor in order for us to meet the deadlines .   It does not only solved on how to meet the deadlines but having a monitoring file   that we can easily refer when the time it is needed . 

 4 . Insight : In applying the storytelling tool , it guides me to come up with the solution , 

 in compliance with the online filing system , now the proof of filing required by the   BIR is not the hardcopy with their stamped “ received ” but the printed copy of their   confirmation receipt via email once the account has been filed or submitted through   their system in a particular period . This is a system generated reply once the filing   or submission was recorded in the system . The content of the reply includes TIN   and type of filing , the period of filing and the time and date it was submitted and   recorded in the system . It is important that confirmation receipt are all accounted   on or before the deadline to avoid penalties . Because of this , a monitoring report   was created   and done every filing . With this storytelling tool , necessary resources   were brought up like the internet connection , the manpower needed , the backup   system and others . 

 5 . Approach : Every tool do not fits to all . It is always dependent on the challenges 

 you want to solve . I think storytelling fits in this challenge . And if there is another   challenge but different from this , I will choose and apply another tool that will best   fit for that challenge to come up with a better solution .

"Visualization 

 Challenge      I am a member of a group of students from an institute that works on the challenge of   identifying the reason for the low level of organizational climate on the part of the   workers with the aim of increasing the sense of belonging and motivation of each   collaborator when developing their tasks in   their area and implement a greater   investment in physical spaces or in representation of time to enhance their performance   in the organization .   We include all the workers of the institute , from the manager or   director to the cleaning workers , working hand in hand with the human resources area ,   which is in charge of guaranteeing an adequate and pleasant space to carry out the   activities in an appropriate way , taking into account   counts a valuable asset such as   employee time .   The solution must guarantee the well - being and motivation of the   workers .     Selection      Projective tools such as visualization inspire to devise innovative solutions allowing to   visualize that need that the client wants to satisfy , how they want to feel and in what   way they could achieve it through closeness , generating an empathy between both   parties .   This tool was selected because we generate a brainstorm allowing a connection   that promotes informal communication and generates confidence to express the   moments , places and activities that enhance the motivation of workers when carrying   out their positions .     Application      The first step to know the internal situation was to carry out an interview where those in   charge of the human resources area participated to know the management in each job of   the different departments of the organization and how close they were between them ,   the second step was to observe   the quality time that each worker spent carrying out   their work , as a third step we generated an empathy map based on the interviews   previously carried out , answering questions such as ¿ what does the consumer ? ¿ What   think and feel ?   ¿ That hears ?   What hurts ?   What does it say and do ?   What do you see ?    And what do you win ? As the fourth and final step , brainstorming was created to devise   how we could meet the need to generate results with the triple line of results , managing   to identify the reason why the sense of belonging of each worker is less   compared to   other aspects that are positive in the organization .     Insight      Our work team managed to identify two aspects that prevented a work environment at   the level of the other items that make up the area .   There are workers who limit   themselves to providing their service and do not feel part of the organizational   community and a lack of communication and trust between managers and collaborators ,   it is incredible how we manage to understand through design thinking the need to create   trust   to generate a feeling of belonging to the place where I dedicated part of my time   and thus be able to give all the potential in the activity and service that I carry out , the   creation of physical spaces with green and pleasant areas so that workers would like to 

 spend more time in them   and allow socialization spaces where knowledge and ways of   carrying out activities are shared among colleagues to generate mental maps and   provide tools to the people who attend , taking into account the new ideas that arise over   time and highlighting the work of those involved in them .   solve the problem in a large   percentage .     Approach      The next time the visualization tool is implemented , the time invested in interviews   would be exchanged for more field work and closer contact with the parties involved to   understand how the processes are applied and the different jobs are developed to   achieve a more connected connection wide in activities .

 by <NAME> <NAME> 

 Challenge and Selection :       As a Venezuelan , wanting to help my country overcome all the difficult situations led me 

 to one of the most beautiful and fulfilling experiences : Community Service . My desire to help   others who I knew were not capable of helping themselves made me commit to a cause that   made me the woman I am today . For the past three years I have been involved in an non - profit   organization that dedicates all their resources to helping these affected communities around   certain cities in <ADDRESS> , by giving them food and medical resources , playing with the kids in   their schools or parks near the zone , and helping families with their situation by offering jobs to   the parents and education for their children . 

 This has been an incredible challenge for me and for the rest of the members of the 

 organization , and with time , we have achieved wonderful goals that at the beginning seemed   almost impossible . <NAME> <NAME> was one of the most useful tools that helped us accomplish   great things , and without it , I think we would have taken another course of action that would   have not been as successful as the one we followed . This design tool made us look for patterns   and themes in the data we collected inside the communities we were working with , and made it   easier to move from the “ What is ? ” to the “ What if ? ” . As said in the lectures , mind mapping   involves studying and analyzing the minds of our customers , not only ours individually , and   thanks to this , we were available to translate the collected insights to concrete ideas .      Application :       The organization started in 2014 , and after a long process of identifying the opportunity 

 and necessities in several communities , we started scoping our project . We applied the Mind   Mapping tool to get a more thorough and concrete insight of what was happening in these   communities , along with what the members of them thought and worried about . We did   interviews , talked with a great amount of people , and observed from different points of view the   situation to try and come up with the better solution . These three things helped us identify   insights and translate them into ideas and concepts . 

 The process of moving from exploring the reality to envision a new future and 

 opportunity , although it sounds fast and easy , it was instead long and difficult , but completely   necessary . Learning about what the members of those communities thought and felt as a way of   mapping the mind of our customers was what helped us focus in specific data to find a more   creative and useful solution . At the end , the organizations scoped a more focused and specific   plan to attend the food , medical and economic situation of the members of selected communities   in <ADDRESS> by creating a space that offered jobs for the unemployed , food for the community ,   medical assistance for those in need , and entertainment facilities for the children . The Mind   Mapping tool was applied successfully and effectively in the project , and made possible for us   ( the organization ) to obtain better results . 

 Insight and <NAME> :        After applying the Mind Mapping tool to the plans of the organizations regarding food , 

 medical , economic , and entertainment resources in the selected deprived communities in   <ADDRESS> , the focus of the whole plan shifted to a higher and better solution . Getting to know   the minds of our customers and focusing on them instead of what the organization thought and   consider as a group , gave us an advantage and a better visualization of the situation . Thanks to   this design tool , we gain a lot of new data , making possible to get a bigger approach in the project   we were proposing . <NAME> <NAME> let us expand our knowledge , as well as our focus on solving   some of the necessities in the mentioned Venezuelan communities . 

 The whole course helped me change my way of thinking and understanding the world , 

 gave me incredible tools to be applied in different situations , and made it possible to find more   innovative and creative solutions to multiple problems around me . I consider that not only the   <NAME> <NAME> tool , but also the storytelling , visualization and learning launch tools were really   helpful for this project . I also think that along with the mind mapping , the learning launch tool   would have contributed too to the organization and its plans , but it is never too late to try new   things , learn and improve from them .

"Hypothesis :       Working from home for the call center employees , will increase overall productivity rate and   job satisfaction .       Challenge :     As a member of my organization ’s general services department , it is our challenge to increase   the efficiency , lower the cost and to increase the employees job satisfaction . The project itself   consist of 7 employees in collaboration with other departments such as the IT and facility   management departments . The project in this basis depends on limited resources within the   organization itself and might not require any additional special tools ( hardware or software ) .   A duration of 30 days is set for this project and working shifts based of a total of 8 hours 5   days a week .       Selection :        In order to quickly and broadly test/ experiment the idea our team chose the learning   launch tool . This is based on the team ’s design and thinking of the idea itself and how it   would be experimented .       Application :       For our first trail of the remote system we brought to our attention to the tools ( software &   hardware ) that were provided in collaboration with the other departments and this will   enable us to asses it and whether we could handle day to day tasks such as meeting ,   incoming/ outgoing calls , customer experience . It was found that those tools not only gave   the opportunity to increase the efficiency but also it showed that wider reach of services for   both employees and customers such as , quicker access to data and resources , wider   connection methods , mobility , increased accuracy , lower cost rates and less time   consumption as have been provided from statistical data from other departments in concern .   It means the quality of services has been increased over the quantity which is far more than   expected . Moreover , it was also found that the idea is more practical , adaptable and   applicable . The first experiment took 2 weeks to be assessed with a lower error rate . As these   tools are simple to use hence the fact of the similarity of systems used by the call center   employees . The second trial was to increase the additional resources that were available to   furthermore to enhance the current state of the remote call center to be more flexible in time   and effort .   This will also provide the team more work - life balance . 

 Insight :      As of our implementation of our project from the assigned duration it came to our attention   that the results from those tools came up to our expectations and has increased t the   department ’s productivity . Assuming that there are no restrictions to use them from home   as some of the data found to be fragile to be viewed by any non - authorized person to get   access to .     Approach :     As our team has been gone through this process in which they used all tools provided , we   came to the conclusion that those tools are the most appropriate to be used in this project   and could be easily implemented within the organization as it is a user - friendly interface   that brings to the success of working from home . But bearing in mind that this could be   used as a foundation for upcoming projects in near future .

"Storytelling - Empathy 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 I am a member of an organization ’s operations team . We work in a highly regulated atmosphere . Our   clients are onshore and they send us work on a daily basis and we charge clients on hourly rate . Our   work is seasonal . Employees are our assets and our clients typically use us when they are in high   pressure . We work on extremely tight deadlines and uncertainty relating to work inflow . Our work   quality and turnaround time determines our moving up the value chain and increasing revenue . We also   need to build relationships with the onshore counterparts which means having regular connects etc .   which then requires us to stretch our days . One of our biggest challenge is to build relationships with the   onshore customers as their time zones are different . Our employees need to be motivated constantly to   constantly meet expectations . 

 I spend a lot of my time coaching them and also motivating them to perform and show them the path   ahead to keep up the aspirations as well as understand the business goals . I also need to align their   personal goals with the business goals . We have regular catch ups where I share with my team my   stories both personal as well my experience at work . This time I use for introspection as well as I ask   them to provide me feedback on what they would have done differently . Similarly I encourage the team   members also to share their stories and we all would collectively introspect . This as a team helped us be   open to feedback , arrive at solutions and also get another point of view . I used this format to also solve   work related issues where we have participative decision making . It could be related to a tough client or   meeting deadlines etc . 

 Application 

 I have a story about using story telling . In one of the regular catch up the discussion point was   on a client feedback . We had received a constructive feedback from a client and we had   realized that the reason for a feedback was more related to the fact that we had not built any   relationship with them . I was talking about pressures that the clients face and my experience of   working onshore . I wanted my team to be customer empathetic rather than just focusing on   client delivery . We are dealing with humans in the end of the day and we need build   relationships in any business . Quality is always a given however building relationships helps in   sustainable business . If we needed to that we need to spend quality time engaging with them   and understanding their requirements . The team member working on the client was stressed   and turned emotional . She vented out her anger on the client ’s stringent timelines and not   being responsive etc . I recognized she needs to be the “ Princess for an hour ” . I let her speak and let   go off all the anger . I asked her if we can go out and take a breath of fresh air rather than be stuck in a   meeting room . While we were walking I let her do all the talking and just asked her probing questions .         Insight & Approach 

 While she was talking she was visualizing and also self - reflecting , she mentioned that she knew that the   feedback would be bad . She knew it as she was not able to build relationship with them or understand   the customer ’s requirement . She was not able to do that as the client ’s time zone was not matching due   to her personal requirement . She had a new born kid and she needed to get home early and   concentrate on him . It was an eye - opener for me because I could see that she was going through a guilt   for months as she was split between meeting both expectations . I thought it was the right time for me   to share my story , I told her about how difficult it was for me to work when my mom was going through   a health challenge . I had to manage teams during the day , customer calls in the night and hospital runs   and doctor ’s discussion . I spoke to her on the emotional and physical drain I went through . I also shared   my daily routine and some tips and tricks I used to get through the time . We both came up with a   solution on how she could come in early so that she can have meetings with the onshore teams in their   evening . I came up with a plan to give her clients in the same time zone that is convenient for her . We   worked on a daily routine and finally all turned out to be good . Now she is a happier person and a high   performer .      We both collectively shared this story with the Women committee and came up with a mentor mentee   program . This program helps women professionals ’ to get guidance from women leaders and identify   solutions for their problems .     I never knew that telling stories can be such a powerful tool . This course has helped me realize   the impact of this tool and use it in a better way .

 Design Thinking For Innovation 

 By : <NAME> <NAME> 

 Reflection- Visualization 

 Challenge 

 I work as a risk and compliance officer in a start - up company . The business environment favours freedom ,   entrepreneurial liberty , openness and empowerment within the employees , creating flexibility and   seamless work environment .   In the age of empowerment and flexibility , controls and procedures have   posed a great challenge . How can we ensure compliance with policies and procedures in the workplace   especially where procedures have not been reinforced before ? The company already has existing policies   which employees are not very conversant with , at the same time , creating new procedures have been   resisted unless on a ‘ putting out fire ’ basis where a crisis occurs . This has posed a great risk in the business   and control failures . 

 With design thinking , we can be able to demystify the problem and come up with ideas and methods of   making controls embraced by employees especially in the said work environment . We will focus on trying   to uncover what our team members , as well as key stakeholders within , consider ineffective or   problematic then generate ideas and methods to help solve this . 

 Selection 

 Looking through design tools , we selected the Visualization tool , which is about visual thinking . It pushes   us beyond using words or language alone . It is a way of unlocking a different part of our brains that allows   us to think nonverbally and that managers might not normally use . This is as referenced by <NAME> <NAME>   in the video lecture . 

 For the development of integrated and complex processes , it is often not enough to communicate   effectively through words and complex explanations . Employees need to understand the need of   observing certain procedures and to be able to see how that affects their day - to - day work . Visualization   tools like drawings , images , sketches , flowcharts help to connect and develop step - by - step understanding   and build a visual aspect to it . This will help us build connections , enable employees to creatively simplify   and align process , and tap into the bigger picture of effective controls . 

 Below is an example of a visual illustration of a process . 

 Making an order process 

 C1 - Internal use 

 Application 

 We began with sitting down with employees in departments teams to understand what they do on a day- to - day basis . We needed to understand why controls are not practiced regularly and why employees do   not effect this . We came to understand that the policies , even though communicated through writing , are   not drilled into their minds for better understanding . 

 Getting to learn their everyday process and procedures , each team was asked to illustrate their process   of working by drawing process chart flows as they discussed . They were asked to illustrate through   diagrams , sketches and arrows how things flow . This created a better understanding and even enabled   the team to put down the process into a standard document , appending the illustration . For effective   controls , the risk and compliance team also highlighted areas of compliance using colour coded writing to   indicate areas of high risk- red , significant risk- orange , medium risk - yellow and low risk- green . This way ,   the teams were able to see the particular areas through the colours that required constant attention   according to level of risk . 

 The team also focused on better communication through video illustrations which remind the employees   policies , with effective visual explanations . Training sessions were also effected where teams participated   by drawing charts of what they understand and having sketches put around the office in areas that needed   to communicate policy . Interactive checklists were created as well where employees were able to know   if they are complying and exercising control . 

 Insight 

 This significantly transformed the challenge which was ensuring compliance of policies and procedures in   the workplace . Employees not only understood how a process flows , but could visually and imaginatively   see the big picture of how exercising control affects their work . They got to have a better understanding   of policies and practice even more . Many teams began creating more procedures within their teams and   building visual charts to explain them . 

 This design tool helped us solve the issue of understanding , and generate more ideas on how to effectively   work in a flexible environment while exercising and observing control . 

 Approach 

 Visualization tool worked ideally in this situation . As mentioned in the video lectures , it is incorporated in   all stages of design thinking from exploration to pattern finding to prototyping and experimentation . This   approach promotes visual thinking and creativity which is great for building innovation ! 

"
"Challenge & selection 

 I am a software architect , so my job includes designing solutions and presenting them to stakeholders .   Presentation can be really difficult part of the job , because the job ’s outcome describes hypothetical   software components which are non - tangible and can hardly be mapped to any well - recognized real- world abstractions . Visualization is a great tool here , because it helps to shape thoughts into visible   images and removes some tension of using technology - specific language . It also allows clearly drawing   boundaries of solution scope and then selecting appropriate level of detailing inside of selected scope . 

 Application 

 Recently one of my development teams decided to review an architecture of its application . At the   starting point , the application was fairly monolithic . It included terribly intertwined ML - modules and   business logic components . We decided to make a move towards microservice approach . This decision   produced long discussions about target architecture . Every team member had their own approach to   decompose the system into modules . Evidently , each approach led to unique outcome . 

 I think that establishing common understanding of microservices ’ boundaries is one of the most difficult   communication problems in software industry . In order to produce clear common vision and predictable   outcome my team and I drew a set of diagrams to visualize system ’s behavior . I used principles of   domain - driven design as a canvas . Firstly , we drew flow of business events through the system . It helped   to understand which functions we needed to implement to process these events . Then we depicted   bounded contexts and their nested aggregates , so we could see interrelationships between them . 

 Insight 

 Process of visualization encouraged an active discussion between team members . Many of them   proposed valuable ideas , and these ideas could be well - understood by others thanks to visual   representation . When we had diagrams on hand , the team obtained clear understanding which   microservices we need , what will they do and how will they interact with each other . It allowed us to   make infrastructural decisions , split works between developers and build a plan of iterations . 

 Approach 

 Visualization shows to be a great tool in many areas due to its impact on presentation ’s visibility and   simplicity . It allows finding common language among people with various backgrounds . I personally   heavily rely on visualization in my work and encourage team members to use it .

 Final Assignment – Reflection : Learning Launch 

 Challenge   I am the Chief Financial Officer of an onshore oil & gas production company in <ADDRESS> .   In   the oil & gas industry , innovation has traditionally focused on discovering and   maximizing reserves , but they have led to today ’s supply glut and low oil and gas prices .   In the current environment , incremental improvements in productivity will not be   enough . In that context , I was challenged by our CEO to put together a team to promote   digital transformation in such a century old industry as “ a path for creating value by   streamlining operations that promote access to energy that ’s safe for the environment   and that will strengthen the company ’s economic performance ” .   The main goals set by   our CEO were to , within the next 3 years : ( i ) improve productivity by 40 % , measured by   the number of employees per active well ; ( ii ) reduce the number of recordable spills by   80 % ; ( iii ) reduce our lifting costs per barrel by 25 % . These goals came from benchmarks   obtained from a sample of USA & Canada based exploration and production companies .     Selection   We put together a team with experienced employees with different backgrounds :   finance , petroleum engineering , process safety , IT , pumpers and mechanics . Some of   those individuals already had some familiarity with design thinking , but we had to   explain the main concepts to the whole group to put everyone on the same page . We   started by discussing What Is/ What If/ What Wows and after a few sections we realized   that a lot of good ideas quickly emerged and we were ready to try the learning launch   tool , which is an experiment conducted in real life quickly and inexpensively meant to   test an idea and prototype . This Learning Launch was our way of testing What <NAME> .     Application   To properly apply the Learning Launch tool , we established some guiding principles : ( 1 )   Set tight boundaries : since this is a learning launch and not a pilot , it is important to plan   for it to end and we set concrete limits on key variables , such as time , geography and   number of variables to measure ; ( 2 ) Work in fast feedback cycles ; ( 3 ) Make it feel real .    For our first learning launch , we focused on testing some Digital Oilfield tools . Digital   Oilfield encompasses a wide range of innovations such as fleet management and   predictive maintenance . These innovations are a result of the maturing of enabling   technologies such as low - cost sensors , big data analytics and cloud computing . The   Digital Oilfield is not a technology play but the combination of several technologies in   innovative ways to utilize technology to drive productivity . In particular , we wanted to   test solutions that could automate field data collection , organization and basic analytics .   This way we expected to free up time from the operations teams , which spent about   40 % of their time just collecting data and checking for on - site spills from the hundreds   of well in our fields . Everyday each one of them would visit each well , but if we had 

 reliable data collected automatically , we would change the pumpers routine to a more   productive “ dispatch mode ” , where the pumpers would be dispatched to solve   problems already detected and pre - analyzed automatically .     We chose one of our 17 oil fields to run a prototype , a field which was close to our   headquarter and where a successful test would have a positive and significant impact in   the organization . We defined the key parameters we wanted to measure in each type   of well and selected the sensors . We also created a simple telecommunications   backbone to collect and transmit the data to our central offices . This first learning launch   which lasted about two weeks allowed us to figure out what worked well and what   needed to be redesigned . Our team went through a one - day assessment where we   invited the key stakeholders in the process and discussed some modifications required   to make it right . Some of the key takeaways were : ( i ) in order to be able to truly rely on   Digital Oilfield solutions resulting in a reduction of personnel going around the field to   collect data and check that everything was ok , we needed to be able to actually see what   was going on in the well sites , and : ( ii ) we needed the telecommunications system to be   extremely reliable , since we could not afford the risk of not noticing   early on an oil spill   or a high production well going offline for a long time . We also realized we needed to   work on the employee ’s feelings about the change and their preparation for the new   operating model to come .     We then launched a second prototype which addressed the key issues identified in the   first test and let it run for about a month . After that we collected the data and made a   presentation to the CEO and to the senior managerial staff in the Company , which   approved the launch of a broader scale initiative to implement the Digital Oilfield in all   the Company ’s fields .        Insight    By applying the learning launch tool , we created an experimentation environment   where it was ok to dream of a completely different operating model and where the   process of design - prototype - test - reassess - test again allowed people to get rid of the   fears involved in failing at a challenge outside of their comfort zones . Without the fear   of damaging one ’s reputation for failing and by applying the technique of fail often/ fail   fast ( and cheap ) we achieved a huge success in addressing the key strategic goals set by   our CEO . Another critical insight came from the realization that managing people ’s   concerns regarding change are as important as the technical aspects . A lot of resistance   ( and also some internal sabotage ) initially came from people ’s fear of not being capable   to adapt to a new operating model . We needed to invest a lot in training and coaching   to help some employees migrate from a physically intense/ repetitive tasks model to a   more analytical/ technical role . Only when these people realized that the Company   would invest in preparing them for a new operating model ( meaning they would not   lose their jobs ) did they really embrace the change . 

 <NAME>   This was one of our first design thinking initiatives in the Company and although some   team members had some theoretical knowledge of the tools , future launch designs   should incorporate some learnings from previous experiences . For instance , we should   be more careful in assembling the launch team incorporating some members with   experience in people management and communications , to make sure we properly   address human aspects of change management and do not let the group be dominated   by engineering and finance types . We should also spend more time early on in the   project aligning concepts and educating all member of the team with basic conceptual   knowledge of the Design Thinking for Innovation toolkit .

"<NAME>   <NAME> 

 Challenge and selection : I am a fellow learner who   implements things and develop , and one of my friend   approached me to give an innovative idea to establish his   swimming club . The problem is , there are a handful of pools   that are present since some time and we needed to think   something different to stand out from the competitors . 

 I used the visualisation and learning launch as my tool of 

 design thinking . 

 Application : First , a suitable area was to be selected to build   our club . So , we researched about the places that did n’t have   swimming pools and also observed the areas where more   people came from who were regular swimmers . 

 After this research we found an appropriate place and   finalised to build our club there . But for now , only the place   was decided . We did n’t want to construct a mediocre pool   like others but build one that had good facilities and made   our clients feel like home . We visited few pools and noted   down about the facilities they offered and facilities they   missed . A list of facilities was created to be included in our   club from all these observations . Some of them are : 

 • A separate heated pool .   • Under glow lights in the pool for night time activities .   • A special diving section .   • A functional roof that was cable to open and close that 

 would be useful during rainy season . 

 •   An exclusive looking seating area , changing rooms and 

 washrooms . 

 • <ADDRESS> area equipped with great lighting and solar 

 panels for electricity conservation . 

 The next plan was to develop a dedicated webpage which 

 displayed all the details of the club and events that were to   be conducted . We decided to host events frequently which   would attract participants and also it is a marketing   technique to promote our club because announcing events   would make the enthusiasts excited and they would also   spread word about their participation in our club that would   make a lot of people know about our club ( Participants   indirectly promoting our club ) . We also plan to invite well   known swimmers and professionals to take frequent classes   in our club that would also attract a lot of swimming   enthusiasts . 

 The main objective behind this plan is to attract people to 

 choose our club as their swimming arena and keep them   engaged and excited . 

 Insight and approach : Once the operations of the club   started , we observed how well it went according to our idea   and on a positive note , our plan was working as our pool was   already a talk between the people due to its well offering   features and the events that were taking place . 

 From what we learned , few people could n’t afford the 

 coaching classes and we plan to offer them an EMI option   and also a discount if at all our client wins in events too . 

 There are also features that are to be added in our website   which can take in bookings for swimming classes and events ,   we also plan to add a forum where people can challenge   others and the identity is kept private from others until they   visit the pool to take part in the challenged event . 

 And again , we are always trying to create something   innovative which would be best to us and our clients as well .

"Design thinking - Storytelling to solve the problem 

 Challenge : 

 To understand elements that lead to success in higher education among first generation and   low - income students . 

 Selection : 

 Listening to and empathizing with their needs , I gained enormous ​insights into the types of 

 support services​ and ​mentoring​ first gens feel will help them navigate the academic and social 

 challenges they face from the time they complete high school throughout college . Anxiety and 

 bewilderment are patterns of behavior I found among first generation low - income students when 

 they share stories about their first encounter with campus culture . Many feel like outsiders , 

 confused by the academy ’s social and academic expectations . 

 Application : 

 I start mind mapping about The social isolation , low self - confidence , and academic paralysis 

 generated by these feelings seem to melt away among first generation / low - income students 

 who study abroad . Why ? What happens when they and their middle- and upper - middle class 

 peers travel to countries and experience unfamiliar cultures and languages ? ​Reports ​document 

 changes in behaviour among first generation / low - income students : an increase in confidence , 

 self - efficacy , openness , perceptual acuity , resilience — general effectiveness in cross - cultural 

 situations . 

 Insight : 

 Are these trends anecdotal or are we really on to something ? Does study abroad add value to 

 the college experience of first generation / low - income students in ways that are fundamentally 

 different from their middle- and upper - middle class peers ? 

 Approach : 

 I will interview first generation / low - income students who have studied abroad and capture their 

 stories . I believe that listening with empathy is the first step toward explaining these unexplained 

 transformations . 

"
"Story Telling 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 I am an intern at an NGO aimed to provide and promote education to the 

 underprivileged society . A new program was recently launched to allow older 

 men and women in the rural parts of the country who had n’t received their high 

 school diploma ( completed matriculation ) to study for the test and receive the 

 diploma . The program was well received and conducted by volunteers and 

 members of the organisation across various villages and states in the country . 

 The students enrolled were primarily middle aged women who were denied 

 education as young girls due to numerous factors . In order to reach a wider 

 audience and convince them to join the program , the team needed to come up 

 with a plan . The medium of communication needed to be impactful and 

 replicable . So what better way , than using the tool of story - telling ? 

 Application : 

 We decided to interview a lady who was enrolled in the program and had 

 completed it . Her story was one which would resonate with majority of the 

 target audience . She was 45 years old , married with 5 children and a housewife 

 who had n’t studied past the 8 grade . Born in a patriarchal family , she was 

 denied to go to secondary school which was almost 12kms away from her home 

 and instead made to carry out household chores . Whereas , her brothers both 

 younger and older were allowed to complete their basic eduction as well as 

 further it . Uneducated , she was denied her dreams and forced to marry at the 

 young age of 18 and run a household . She was humiliated and her voice 

 disregarded since she was “ uneducated ” . Her dreams of becoming a graduate 

 remained unfulﬁlled until this program .   She was a diligent student and earned 

 her diploma within a year of joining . She was then able to start tutoring young 

 kids and earn her own pocket money instead of depending on her husband . She 

 said “ She was given a ‘ Second Chance ’ at life ” . 

 GEOLOGY 101 REPORT � 1 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 That was truly enlightening and heart warming story . Being somebody who 

 was given the opportunity to study and chase their dreams , it made me feel 

 grateful and appreciative of the liberty and opportunities I had received . 

 A simple portrayal of one ’s story had affected me drastically . So why 

 could n’t it affect others , especially those who had experienced the same or 

 similar situation ? 

 Therefore , as a team we decided to create infographics , ﬂyers , videos and 

 other engaging material based on her story in multiple languages . This allowed 

 volunteers and members to go to untapped communities and spread the word 

 there to help convince both local ofﬁcials and community members to allow the 

 program to be run and convince people to join as students . 

 Who would have thought that a housewife from a small unknown town , 

 who completed her matriculation 30 years later , would become the face of a 

 nation - wide program by being a role model and somebody the students aspire to 

 be ?

"STORYTELLING 

 CHALLENGE & SELECTION 

 Behind every great achievement there is a great story , the story could be of education , 

 training , practice , discipline or even sacrifice . I personally feel storytelling is a great tool of 

 design thinking because a story can be told from heart and it is the reflection of our true 

 actions in past which when expressed can help attain deeper insights of our work , providing 

 a great scope for improvement . Sitting in a group , sharing and discussing each other stories 

 lead us to lot of different thoughts and innovative ideas . Asking questions , listening to 

 various stories , sharing experiences and explaining values not only engages people in 

 thinking deep but also establishes a sense of empathy in the peer group which is a basic 

 step in order to make the design success . After the experiences are shared solutions can be 

 decided through vivid verbal or visual accounts . 

 APPLICATION 

 Storytelling has no borders . Every person regardless of age , gender , race , involves and 

 engages in it .   Usually in a group discussion we all sit together and share our experiences . 

 Stories are captivating and we learn from them . They ensure full attention is paid and a tight 

 hold is maintained until the end . 

 There are different forms of storytelling for example digital , visual , skits or plays , images , 

 animations , videos , text , etc . These forms open up opportunities for many approaches 

 including content , thematic , structural , etc .   As a student I have applied design thinking to 

 understand the elements of success during my phase of choosing the right stream after 

 intermediate . And storytelling is what I chose to do out of all odds and it helped me gain 

 knowledge about the phase . 

 INSIGHT AND APPROACH 

 What I can infer from storytelling is that it ’s a great tool to think innovatively and creatively . 

 Being creative is thinking of something that no one has ever thought of . So , storytelling 

 teaches us to think out of box by learning from different stories ( experiences of your peer 

 group ) . There are several other outcomes of this . For example storytelling increases self- 

 confidence , on regular practice one can overcome fear of expression and be a good 

 speaker . It answered lot of my questions like , “ is studying abroad a good decision ? ” , “ Is 

 Computer Science Engineering my thing to do ? ” and many more . Listening in empathy is 

 something I strongly believe in and realised that its one approach to success .

"REFLECTION - STORY TELLING 

 Challenge and Selection : 

 Story telling is a great to analyze different problems in our surroundings . I also encountered   something that I was already experiencing myself . In our society I can see that there are many   people out there who are HSP ’s ( Highly sensitive personalities ) . It ’s a problem /a social issue   many people are facing but a very little population is aware of such . These personalities are   extreme at every kind of emotion to show or express . They are friendly in nature and confident   enough to gather more people around them . They are attractive yet sensitive ones , try to   explain even a small issue and give justifications even if not needed . They have complexities   and compare themselves with others , letting themselves down and useless . These personalities   feel little issues as well and do a great deal of overthinking on sarcasms and jokes as well .   People ’s behavior towards them is non empathetic . They do n’t think before they speak , they   do n’t analyze the selection of their words for them . Knowing about their emotionality they   do n’t treat them specially or change their behaviors . People deal them normally and that ’s not   the requirement to make them feel better or normal citizens of the society . Such people are   wanting separate attention and condolence that everything is alright and you are beautiful the   way you are . I used the above data to help out such unprivileged people who are not being   heard making them more independent and confident about themselves . 

 Application : 

 I work with an organization for orphan children where the CEO is really friendly and wanting to   meet all the demands and wishes of the orphans in any case . What I could see in him are the   symptoms of HSP ’s . He is extremely friendly as well as sensitive about things , comparing his   work and outstanding efforts with others but still not satisfied what he does . He still is not   trusting his capabilities and efforts as best . That complex of not being like others is making him   do comparison . He is calling himself useless or trash although its not like that . His organization   is the most renowned and preferred . I saw him and figured out that he needs condolence from   a trustee friend . I jumped into the field finding it a great opportunity to help him out . Talked to   him as frankly as I could irrespective of any barriers . I started gaining his trust day by day . 

 Insight and <NAME> : 

 And what happened was an ultimate miracle for both of us , this exercise was not just an action   but had a reaction too .   He started to trust me the most and felt a lot better in all this I tried to   tell him his real worth and opened his eyes for what he is doing is amazing . 

 As I am also an HSP I got a friend to talk to and helped a victim come out of his shell . He not   knowing that I was the same as him changed me too as I trusted him and talked to him the   same way as he did . We both worked out for each other as bicycle wheels , both worked   together . 

 This course made me realize that I could reach out to more people and just using a small tool of   storytelling can make a lot of people feel much better . Not just feeling better but helping to   emerge the bright shinning stars come out of their shells and inspire others . 

"
"Challenge : 

 Story telling is an art which connects emotions and showcases values of people . It does n't just satisfy the   sharing of vision and humanity . It is also used to share knowledge , lessons learned in life , and social and   cultural values . This is especially useful in corporate life . 

 The challenge is to make the people from the top tiers of management understand the perspectives of   those of ground level employees . For that , story telling should be in simple   language . This process   should inspire and unite people . It need not be either completely true or fictional as long as it adds value   to the feelings of the people . The audience should get inspired from the storyline & work towards their   goal in a quicker manner . 

 Selection : 

 Selecting the audience is also a main factor in success of a story telling session . Your audience should be   focused towards a common goal . To be a good storyteller you need to be a good listener . For every story   process , you need a good theme , a vivid setting , a strong narration , and a coherent plot . This will make   the audience engaged throughout the process . The story   should be interesting and interactive to keep   audience in enthusiastic state . 

 Application : 

 I have used the application of story telling in various situations of my life . I can share my real life   experiences which helped me   & my friends to get placed in a good company . Initially we never knew   how to prepare for placement . One day I met a senior who comes from a very rural background who   now works in a very reputed company . Their parents and friends are so proud of him . I took   this   concept as my basis and built upon it . I wove some interview experience into a fiction also based on my   real life , as I too am from a rural area and could identify with that senior ’s struggles . I shared this story   with my friends . They took inspiration from the story and started working hard to learn aptitude and   logical and technical reasoning .   As a result of this , my friends and I got selected into reputed core   companies . 

 Insight : 

 When I entered into a company , I was supposed to manage people whose experience is two times that   of mine . At the time I motivated them to achieve the vision of the organisation . These people were not   paying their complete attention to my commands . After analysing how to improve the process , I found   story telling would be a good option . I asked their views about the workplace and working ambience .   The people were a little bit lethargic . I asked my senior professionals about how to improve that   situation . Then I came with a story to ignite the people 's minds and I improved the working ambience .   Now , we are the top performing team in the   organization . We are generating good revenue through   team work . This is not possible without the help of this story telling tool . 

 Approach : 

 I used this tool in my organization in order to make a better work place . This helped me to guide all my   juniors to work in a better environment . Some people can push the employee to work without any   motivation . You can achieve the success but the employee engagement would be very low . 

 But for longlasting success , you need to motivate them . For that you really need story telling . To grow in   people management , it is a mandatory tool . If we use story telling along with other tools like   visualisation , it would be helpful to achieve overall success for the organization . 

 I hope I can someday be the best in my department by using various thinking processes as well as   optimizing team management .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge 

 As an Urban planner , I work with a team of young professionals in planning for a sustainable urban   transformation in an overpopulated developing country . This was a major challenge because more   and more people keep migrating to the cities . The population density in cities increased   consumption , production and pollution . These activities created problems like air pollution ,   greenhouse gas emissions , waste , and poverty . 

 To achieve a successful sustainable urban transformation much emphasis is placed on structural   transformation by focusing on Governance and Planning , Innovation and Business , and <NAME>   and Consumption . We are to develop policies for strategic planning quickly with a flexibility for   rapidly changing urban conditions , and also encourage symbiotic relationships among industries ,   governments , universities , and citizens to ensure sustainable management . 

 Selection 

 Our team decided to use the storytelling tool to appeal / connect the policy made for the strategic   urban planning to the values of our audience ( Industries , Governments , Universities , and <NAME> ) .   <NAME> was also used to encourage our audience to act sustainably by outlining a pathway   towards a well - planned and more compact city that prioritizes people , provides a walkable urban   development scheme and approaches waste management sustainably . 

 Application 

 Coming up with these policies / strategies involved my team and I discussing future expectations of   urban transformation with several Industries , Governments , and <NAME> . We explained to them   the goal of a sustainable city , how it provides people with high quality living environment without   using huge amounts of natural resources . We made our audience understand that our natural   resources are finite , and also understand the effects our consumption of these natural resources has   on the environment in the long run . We told stories about energy in sustainable cities , the reliance   on burning fossil fuels and how the installation of solar panels reduces energy use in buildings ,   this was done to encourage more energy efficient buildings . A sustainable city that offers high   quality life , consumes energy efficiently and produces energy from renewable sources . 

 We also told stories about creating other forms of transportation such as light rail networks , mass   transport , bus networks , making our audience understand that the way a city is planned influences   the ways in which people get around that city . We also shared stories addressing waste   management , the process of collecting , transporting and treating waste for proper disposal , reuse ,   recycling , composting , and energy generation . 

 Insight 

 We realized that achieving urban sustainable development meant addressing other important goals   of sustainability such as protecting biodiversity , reducing pollution , enabling equity and social   justice . 

 Approach 

 We created a list of agencies , industries , and governmental bodies that are directly and indirectly   involved in urban transformation that have a big influence on the planning of urban developments .   We reached out to these agencies , industries and governmental bodies , sat at a round table and sold   the challenge to them , spoke at length about the challenge and then presented them with possible   solutions .   A committee was then created to oversee urban developments . This committee is   responsible for strategic planning and policymaking concerning urban planning which centers   around urban infrastructure , urban mobility and Naturvation ( Nature Based Solutions ) .

"After benchmarking your scoring , we suggest you print at least one copy of the Assignment Rubric   and jot down some notes as you review your peers ’ submissions . Notes will help you assign scores   and develop clear , written feedback for your peers . We have included a written feedback section for   each rubric element ; however , if you score any given element a three and do not have any feedback ,   simply type “ none ” in that particular text box . 

 Remember , English is n't everyone 's native language . Focus primarily on how well the submission   meets the rubric criteria . When writing feedback , use a constructive and polite tone . 

 If you encounter either a blank submission or seemingly plagiarized content while reviewing , please   do not assign any scores . Instead , click the "" Flag this submission "" button and indicate "" This   submission is incomplete "" or “ This submission contains plagiarized content ” as the reason for   flagging . If you are flagging due to seemingly plagiarized content , please provide the content and its   original source . After flagging a submission , you will be prompted to review another peer ’s   submission . 

 Everyone enrolled in the course must review at least three other submissions to ensure everyone   receives a grade ; however , many learners complete more to help their peers who are still waiting .

"Reflection of the Visualization Tool 

 Challenge and Selection 

 I work as a Scrum coach in an agile environment . As a Scrum Master you are the facilitator for your team and you are   responsible for a whole lot of meetings and that your team is doing well . That means you are in charge that everyone   is collaborating and that you start from the same ground and that everyone is understanding what is going on and that   you improve from iteration to iteration . 

 So for my example I chose my work within the <NAME> framework to explain why it is so important to use the   Visualization tool . The most important thing for Scrum is Communication . We work in self organized teams . All the   meetings are timeboxed . We need quick solutions when a problem occurs or if it is a wicked one we need a good   analysis of the problem . We have to look at the problem from a different angle so it is a good idea to take some pens   and paper . Drawing makes complex and difficult things a lot easier to understand . 

 With visualization you get a better overview about what is going on in the team . For that reason in an agile   environment you use Visualization all the time . 

 The video from <NAME> <NAME> explained it very well – it ’s about using the other half of your brain ( the right side ) . You   start to think nonverbal and trigger your creativity . Using different colors and symbols and drawing little figures helps to   get things done and solve problems and get insights from the team . 

 Application 

 I started with little things like the following – just using symbols and colors . 

    Visualization can be used to tell everyone the current status using the famous green and red traffic lights . 

    Using a Kanban Board Visualization can be used to address something to a specific group of people in your   team for example the testing people get their tasks on a blue sticky note or 

    You can use it to address the tasks to everyone in the team . A person can have a little picture as an avatar –   so everyone knows who is responsible for the task . 

 Once we moved forward and discovered the possibilities we started to use it more often – shown in the following   examples : 

    You can tell a whole story with visualization , e.g. you can draw your ( sprint ) goal to illustrate it for everyone .   Usually the sprint goal is one sentence about what is the most important thing in the next iteration . When you   start drawing that statement everyone in the team becomes a better understanding – it helps to focus on the   goal . It increases the teamwork and the buy in . We do the work with 6 teams – so in the end we have a little   “ art gallery ” and everyone is proud about their future product . It is a big buy in for the team and stakeholders . 

    In Scrum there is a meeting called “ retrospective ” . In that meeting we visualize all the time . I like to start the   meeting with different pictures so everyone can express their mood with the help of a picture as a metaphor .   This is very important so can start working – everyone got his head in the room and is open minded . 

    When we start to talk about a problem or a problem occurs – we start drawing . This is also called “ the crazy   eight ” . Everyone is taking a piece of paper and folding it several times to get 8 sections . Then everyone gets 5   minutes to sketch different ideas to solve the problem with pictures . At the beginning it is very hard to start   drawing , but once you started you get into the flow . After sketching you present the best ideas to the group or   you dot vote for the best ideas . And then you can start again using the best ideas until you found the most   suitable solution . 

 Insight & Approach 

 Visualization can be used to show complex correlating things . That makes it a lot easier for people to understand and   share their thoughts and show up with new ideas to solve problems . It helps to remember things and you do n’t have to   be an artist to visualize . I can recommend a book : Bikablo 2.0 : New Visuals for Meeting , Training & Learning . This   book can help you to get started with visualization . It really works and it is worth trying it more often . 

 The Visualization tool is a key technique for better and quicker solutions and a better communication – not only within   the <NAME> framework . 

 Everyone should at least try to apply it – it really opens your mind and teamwork is getting easier and it is more fun 

"DESIGN THINKING TOOLS- VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge : 

 As a remedial asset officer I deal with customers whose loan has completely gone bad . The major   challenge I have mostly is how to present my data information on none performing loans , to enable a   proper decision is carried out on recovery . Therefore , for this goals to be achieved I have to use a tool to   pass information on all NPL account to the required stakeholder to notify them of where this loan is   currently , where we are heading and how they can be resolved in - order not to affect the liquidity of the   bank and also keep it running in the nearest future . 

 Selection : 

 I use Visualization tools to achieve my goals by creating images , diagrams , and animations to   communicate a message to the necessary stakeholders on decision making . Why I choose this   techniques for my challenge is to achieve a share understanding amongst stakeholders on the NPL   ( None performing loans ) , that is to give a clearer picture of all NPL , so that a bridge on WHAT IS , WHAT   IF , WHAT WOWS and WHAT WORKS is built before an appropriate decision can be taken to prevent   future threats that can hinder the growth and development of the bank ( lack of liquidity ) . 

 Application : 

 I start the process by creating images on various regions . I use diagrams to show the position of each   NPL in this regions . To develop this images and diagrams I had to collect existing data of this various   regions . Then with the help of this data collected I was able to create diagrams ( graphics and <NAME> was   use to show the state of the bank and its debtors ) and also use images to show how this bad loans can   affect the growth of the bank . 

 Insight : 

 The insight I gained from applying the tool I selected on my major challenge as a recovery officer is that   with the help of this tools selected , <ADDRESS> on way forward towards recovery becomes a shared Idea . That   is , I have been able to understand that before design thinking can take place a bridge ( WHAT IS , WHAT   IF , WHAT WOWS and WHAT WORKS ) has to be built or a prototype is generated , which can give an edge   on the direction of the resolution of this bad loans and also dictate if this challenge towards recovery is   WICKED OR TAMED challenge . 

 Approach : 

 Visualization tools used helps to give stakeholders a clear picture on the information on NPL am trying to   pass across , but what I would do differently next time is to use LEARNING LUNCH tools simply because it   involves hypothesis , that way stakeholders will be able test new ideas drive from information gather on   recovery , how to meets its need and avoid more loans going bad through this hypothesis testing in the   nearest future .

"The Application of Design Thinking Tool In Discovering Students ’ Inability to <NAME> 

 and <NAME> <NAME> in ESL Writing Class 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> 

 Introduction 

 The design thinking tool was applied in a classroom environment of a secondary school where   the focus was on teaching and learning . There are five aspects of this reflection : challenge ,   selection , application , insight and approach . 

 Challenge 

 As a teacher in a secondary school of a rural area in <ADDRESS> , the least developed state of <ADDRESS> ,   teaching and learning are the core business of my job . Almost all of our students have difficulties   in generating ideas in writing tasks .   I am an English teacher and I always hear my students say   that they have no idea of what to write or they simply say “ I do n’t know ” whenever I ask them a   question . There are many assumptions of how this could happen : lower English proficiency , lack   of confidence , lower grasp of thinking skills or poor level of motivation to learn . Therefore , it is   crucial for me to identify the root cause of this issue and help the students to generate and   develop ideas better . I therefore selected a class of 17 students where we intended to overcome   this problem by identifying what areas of our teaching and learning that should be improved . 

 Selection 

 I introduced the students with the design thinking tools I learned from this course and attempted   to make these techniques as relevant as possible to them with examples from everyday life ,   school and teaching techniques . We decided that <NAME> <NAME> was the best tool for us to try .   The tool was discussed thoroughly in the Week 4 lectures which consisted of one particular   video on Learning Launch Tool . <NAME> <NAME> was selected because it was consistent with   the teaching stages that we do in schools that involve processes of learning and discovering via   testing and experimenting . Plus , this technique shows similarities with action research methods   that teachers usually conduct in their classroom . Since I always tell the students that trial and   error and discovery learning are essential in their development , we felt that this technique was   the most plausible one since it allowed us to test our ideas to seek confirmation or   disconfirmation . 

 Application 

 For the first learning launch , we attempted to focus on enhancing student - centered learning   where students were the ones who created their own questions instead of teachers based on Q- Matrix ( <NAME> , 1993 ) .   I trained the students on how to construct questions using Q - Matrix   and how some higher order thinking questions could be designed based on the chart . We started   applying it in our class in which each individual student created their own higher order thinking   question based on a given literary text . We then selected one question for everyone to answer .   Their submitted their answers to me and I scored them using Structure of Observed Learning   Outcomes ( SOLO ) taxonomy ( Hattie & Brown , 2004 ; Potter & Kustra , 2012 ) . We conducted this 

 technique for four times in a row in our class . I then shared the results of the scoring to them and   discussed the feasibility of the technique . 

 For our second learning launch , we changed our focus on students ’ development of creativity in   writing using the SCAMPER technique for students to generate and expand ideas creatively .   SCAMPER technique is an acronym for a set of operators or categories that are used to generate   ideas : ( S ) Substitute , ( C ) Combine , ( A ) Adapt , ( M ) Modify / Magnify / Minimize , ( P ) Put to other   uses , ( E ) Eliminate , and ( R ) Reverse / Rearrange ( <ADDRESS> , 1997 ) .   I trained the students on how to   use this technique before applying in our class . The students were given a literary text that was   either a short story or a poem . The students were required to study the given text . They then   composed a short story or a poem using this technique where they applied at least one of the   operators of SCAMPER in creating their own version of the given text that could be short stories   or poems . In using this technique , the students were individually required to share their idea to   the entire class . Hence they orally spoke about their ideas as well as wrote them down . This   activity was conducted in four sessions . Their improvised short stories and poems were assessed   with SOLO rubric ( Brabrand & Dahl , 2009 ) and Creativity Rating Scales ( <NAME> et al . , 2003 ;   Torrance , 1964 , <NAME> , 1998 ;   Soh 1997 ) 

 Insight 

 The implementation of Learning Launch Tool in the first launch revealed that the students had   no difficulties in generating higher order thinking questions but their responses to such questions   in class remained poor , short , undeveloped and they exhibited lower motivation in doing the   tasks especially in generating and developing their ideas . We therefore discovered that students ’   level of interest in the tasks highly influenced their commitment in generating and expanding   their ideas . They were able to generate several ideas but they did not elaborate these ideas in a   more developed manner . Thus , our assumption that the students could not generate ideas might   not be caused by their lower thinking skills or language proficiency but rather their interest in the   tasks that they were given . 

 Our second Learning Launch helped us to see that students were able to produce creative ideas   and expand them in details when they were given more freedom to be creative and they had the   opportunity to orally present their ideas to their classmates .   They demonstrated great level of   interest and commitment in the implementation of <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . Thus , these gained   insights will serve as fundamental information to the next steps in enhancing students ’ ability to   be creative and critical thinkers . 

 Approach 

 Since the Learning Launch Tool appeared to be practical , consistent and effective in helping us   to gain more insights on the possible causes to the problem our students faced , this technique   will be used in our future thinking design processes especially if our focus is on the teaching and   learning that occurs in classroom . This tool allows students and teachers to work collaboratively   in a familiar and comfortable environment where students are more willing to contribute and   share their opinions in the class as well as to take part in the process . The nature of Learning   Launch which focuses on experimenting , discovering , learning and improving the next step are   more viable in helping us to identify the solution to our problem . 

 Conclusion 

 Thinking Design is a viable approach of facilitating the process of innovation and problem- solving in education . This technique should be promoted and expanded further in order to   enhance its application as an effective tool in identifying problems and solutions .

 Challenge 

 I am currently developing a project for the benefit of the agricultural sector in my country ,   the challenge for me and my team is to minimize the influence of intermediaries in the   agricultural field , i.e. those who resell products more expensively to consumers and pay   low prices to farmers for their products . 

 In addition to what was mentioned in the previous paragraph , we seek to provide different   tools that adapt to different profiles , that is , as a team we classify the stakeholders of the   project into three groups . On the one hand , consumers , who will have access to a virtual   store and a chat that will allow them to interact with the farmer , the chat is intended to   answer questions that often the consumer is made when buying a product but can not solve   because the information is very limited , such as for obtaining this product many pesticides   were used ? what fertilizers were used to harvest the product ? The second stakeholder is the   farmer , who will have access to publish their products and sell them at the price he   considers relevant , also to learning tools , which serve and are a bridge to improve and get   support to produce better crops . Finally , the trainers , which are responsible for providing   learning to the farmer . This last - mentioned stakeholder is the component that gives a   different value to our project , since in the market there are similar ideas , but do not go   beyond , we as a team want to transform and support the agricultural sector in more ways ,   innovating and providing them as we mentioned accompaniment . 

 To synthesize the above mentioned , it seeks to connect the rural sector with the urban   sector , in order to economic development and more flexible for consumers and farmers , in   turn using new tools and models , such as teaching to grant the accompaniment to the   farmer , on the other hand , for the consumer to establish direct relationships with the   producer to access information of interest .       Selection 

 As a team and listening to the target audience of our project , we established and realized   that the most conducive tool and that best suited the need , was the use of mind mapping ,   this because it allows us to deploy central and important ideas to consider for the   development of the project . Mind maps can be defined as creative solutions and it was just   that what made us choose this tool , because we wanted to find solutions that had an impact ,   that adapted to the need , but above all to the profiles of stakeholders and especially looking   from different perceptions of how the world was working with respect to the agricultural   sector . 

 On the other hand and taking as reference the video conference called <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ,   from minute 8:00 in week 3 , they mention something very important , this is the exposure of   new perceptions and observation , as a team we took this into account , because the   agricultural sector in our country faces great challenges and what better to learn from them   and know them through the people who face them daily , all that made in turn that as a team   our attention was focused on the mind mapping tool , because we wanted to see from a   diverse and new perception as is the structure and role of stakeholders in the field .       Application 

 The first thing was to establish the sector , which is the agricultural sector , then to establish   the stakeholders and the role they had in the sector , and then to break down the effects and   the history of agriculture in our country . In order to get key ideas we tried to engage as   much as possible with the stakeholders , we listened to their experiences , the problems they   faced , what they were looking for and what they wanted , all with the intention of providing   solutions that would impact and give opportunities to the stakeholders . 

 As the agricultural sector covers too many points , in order to synthesize all the ideas in a   more accurate way , we observed those that are more concise , all this thinking at the time of   implementing possible solutions , which of these ideas can lead us to provide real solutions   and above all that represent and reflect stakeholders . By synthesizing the ideas we obtained   a great result and are more specific data that helped us to finish establishing links with the   object that drives the project . 

 Finally , thanks to the use of mind maps , to provide us with ideas in a timelier manner , we   could emerge to other techniques to raise ideas for solutions , such as methods such as   SCAMPER , PNI , Use Cases , among the most prominent . The mentioned techniques went   hand in hand with the mental maps because they were derived from the use of these and   these techniques in turn allowed us to define the model by which we wanted to solve the   problem , this model is the use of technologies and through a web page to provide solutions   for the field .       Insight 

 The insight I gained led me to reflect on more factors that influence a real solution to the   problem and to understand that agriculture is a huge sector , with diverse problems . The   mind map detailed elementary ideas , but also brought up some questions , such as how will   the distribution of the product work , what are the possible means of payment for the   purchase and sale of the product , such dilemmas are essential for a positive and beneficial   outcome for the stakeholders . On the other hand , regarding how the vision affected the   design thinking , it was really necessary , because during the process we were only thinking   and as it was not mentioned in week 1 , the design thinking goes beyond thinking , it is about   innovating and realizing this through the tool was essential for a good development of the 

 idea , because precisely as a team we wanted to differentiate ourselves by offering   something new and for the benefit of stakeholders .       Approach 

 In the future the tool could be used individually for each topic and problem of the   agricultural sector , this in order to get a concise idea and then relate it to other ideas , that is ,   look at each idea and study it from the eyes of stakeholders , and then break down key   elements that this idea can share with others and thus finally have a result that fits more   easily and more accurately to the need . The use of mind maps is a very viable option ,   because it reflects interaction between various parties , but if the maps do not know how to   handle and if you do not make a good breakdown of ideas can not give a solution to the   problem posed . In conclusion the aspect to improve is more about the organization   when breaking down ideas , for a simple reason and that is that if the breakdown is not   punctual , the solution to the problem will not be real and according to the need .

"DESIGN THINKING IN PATIENT - CENTRICITY IN HOSPITALS 

 Challenge : Describe your challenge , including all relevant information . 

 The situation that required me to experiment some of the concepts of Design   Thinking was a workshop on Patent - Centricity that I was conducting for para - clinical   and technical support staff for a large hospital based out of southern <ADDRESS> . There   were close to 25 participants and we were looking at the problem of Abuse in Health   Care ( AHC ) . 

 Selection : In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( e.g. , what   it is and why you selected it for your challenge . 

 I experimented with a combination of visualization and story - telling by blending both   of these concepts together to construct a coherent narrative through which   participants could discuss and understand how abuse in health care can be   addressed and contained . 

 Application : Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge   ( e.g. , what you did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively ) . 

 Participants were given chart papers and were asked to define their identity as   patient care workers by using pictures that they could either draw or cut out of   magazines which were supplied to them . As a next step , the participants were   grouped together into groups of 5 members and were asked to stitch together visuals   from each other and explore commonalities and differentiators , both of which helped   them blend and synergise and also identify elements which were discordant and   which may be incongruent to their identities as health care workers . The discussions   were meant to encourage discourse between the participants as the search for a   wholesome identity was explored by members from these cross functional units that   we had put together as teams . Team members were also encouraged to explore   their own experiences as patient parties and share some of their experiences that   could resonate within the group and enable a deeper understanding of excellence in   patient care . Each team had to share at least one narrative as a patient party and   then explore roles and role reversals . 

 The story - telling component utilised a narrative from the <ADDRESS> , which is an   Indian epic and which explored the concept of empathy and solution finding by   exploring character identities and what - if scenarios by choosing characters with   whom the teams empathised and played out the narrative . The other team members   which acted as spectators were encouraged to query and point out character flaws   and strengths in understanding growth and decline of the characters in the narrative   that was shared . 

 Insight : Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your   challenge ( e.g. , how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about   design thinking more broadly ) . 

 The outcome gave a few insights as a training facilitator on the efficacy of using   design principles in exploring solution finding for a complex problem such as patient- centricity in hospitals . <NAME> , was the enthusiasm amongst the participants in   exploring solutions through the use of creative tools such as visualisation and story- telling since we are all naturally gifted story tellers – some using language and also   non - language based narrative development . The workshop encouraged me to keep   experimenting with the use of design principles and we were later encouraged , as   groups , to deploy one tangible solution to enable patient - centricity at the hospital   which we monitored and developed over the next 6 months . Solutions that grew out   of this workshop enabled technological development of patient management ,   improvements in dietary areas as well as greater synergy amongst key para and   technical units to work in greater harmony by placing the patient at the centre of    care giving . 

 Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool   you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why . 

 What I want to explore is how another group in another hospital would respond to a   similar set of tools that are deployed in patient care . Would there be consistency in   solution finding ? Would another group from another geography and hospital behave   differently and if so , what would the differences be ?

 DESIGN THINKING FOR INNOVATION 

 FINAL ASSIGNMENT 

 Reflection – Storytelling 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The tool I used was the tool of <NAME> . I work in a social organization which provides   social development to vulnerable sector in their area of influence . The social theme that   I work with was the following : Access to drinking water consumption in rural communities   in the 4 communities surrounding the Argos plant in <ADDRESS> , <ADDRESS> . 

 Argos 's “ Piedras Azules ” cement plant is located in the department of <NAME> ,   <ADDRESS> . From the beginning of its operations in the country , a fundamental pillar for   the organization is sustainability , it is important in the search for a relationship with the   communities surrounding the plant ; in order to be good neighbors and allies in their   development . 

 In 2010 , an initial diagnosis was made documenting different socioeconomic aspects to   determine and prioritize the social impact that would serve as a roadmap for the   execution of a community development plan , continuously supporting innovative social   initiatives with great impact for the entire community . Thus , one of the basic needs   prioritized by the 4 communities of incidence in <NAME> is access to drinking water .   At present , the communities have a supply water source which supplies a large part of   the homes in these communities ; however , it is not potable , but only pipe water without   any type of treatment . It should be noted that a significant percentage of the population   is in a high level of poverty due to the high unemployment rate in the area , resulting in a   deficit in the family economy . The largest source of household income is through a salary   from the private sector with 25 % ( from the jobs generated by the cement plant , as well   as other jobs generated in the urban area of the municipality ) , followed by farming on   account their own , that is to say that 19 % of the families in the community dedicate   themselves to cultivating the land to sell their product . The rest of the population obtains   income from remittances sent by relatives or informal enterprises within and outside the   community . According to data from the study , most families survive on an income of $   200 a month . 

 This lack of income is the fundamental result by which in the homes of the families in   these rural communities they do not consume drinking water , mainly due to the high   costs that a bottle of water represents in their economy . It is estimated that an average   family consumes three bottles per week , the prices of each bottle are approximately $   1.80 per unit , spending a minimum of $ 21.6 per month on average . Added to this   problem are the health difficulties derived from the consumption of non - potable water for   humans , such as : diarrhea and parasitism , especially in children . 

 I use this information to develop different strategies to try and find a way to help with an   innovating solution that may help the population to access to safe water 

 Application 

 This tool will be useful in the main documentation in order to tell a story of a resident who   has been affected for years by the consumption of non - potable water and how this has   had a multiplying effect on the rest of his family nucleus . Likewise , it will provide 

 usefulness to document the initial problem and how the approach to the solution can   have a significant impact on the residents . Likewise , it will allow to show a real and   essential panorama of the problem to possible / future social partners for the   management of resources for the implementation of the innovative solution in the   community . 

 When I make the application of the storytelling I document the story of the resident I   could tell they were lacking of good health and a system that assures them to provide   access to water and also safe water for their consume . I made him to demonstrate me   the type of water that came up of their faucet .   It turned out that with a simple method I    take samples of the water to determine the level of contamination in the same to be able   to evaluate the current situation of the water and thus start with the innovative social   solution . 

 Insight & Approach 

 A sample of the water analyzed in the laboratory , revealed that the water is not suitable   for human consumption , this because the water has an electrical conductivity higher than   those allowed by national and international standards , in addition the water contains a   silica index higher than that allows the national standard . They do not have a water   treatment system . Some houses have basins for collecting water in precarious   conditions , in other cases they use corroded plastic or metal tanks . 

 So I told this story to the social organization I work with , and I think it had a big impact   on the Board of Directors . We started to document all the population water access   problems to start with social projects that would made them to solve this problem . Also ,   we started to look at cooperation agencies that have external funds at their disposal to   finance water projects with a social focus in communities . 

 This course allowed me to apply this useful tool that will allow us to better evaluate the   project .

"Design Thinking Challenge - Learning Launch 

 By <NAME> <NAME> , 4/2/19 

 Challenge 

 I am a project manager in field operations and recently inherited a project to change behavior of our   field technicians .   The “ ask ” is for our field technician ’s to start leaving descriptive notes as to what they   did to resolve a customer ’s issue .   The importance and value of this effort is tremendous .   The intention   is to leverage the data we collect from the notes and other relevant data ( such as call reason and   technician resolution ) to influence how our call center team is trained and to improve their tools to   eliminate sending technicians for issues that can be fixed by us remotely or by guiding the customer   through the fix .   It is extremely important for the technicians to embrace and adopt this new procedure   by not only entering these notes , but entering the right information to support data analysis to uncover   the root cause . 

 Selection 

 While myself and many other identified subject matter experts could have easily pulled together several   solid solutions and approaches to this project , I opted to leverage the Learning Launch to ensure we   identified and deployed the best solution to not only be successful but to ensure we sustain our success .    Due to the fact that I am very much aware that changing behavior is no easy feat and by already having   a keen sense of who my customers are and what is important to them , I did anticipate they would feel   uneasy about the request as it will add time to their job and they may even be fearful to enter honest   and accurate information in the note the learning launch felt like the right tool to ensure we were   creating a simple and intuitive solution to help create their buy in and adoption .    The learning launch   process allowed me to focus more time on generating out of the box ideas and surfacing even more   assumptions than we have today .   But most importantly , the process of conducting a small test with   those that actually have to use it , adopt to it and embrace it is where the most value came from . 

 Application 

 I gathered subject matter experts , those that had previously been field technicians and others that did   not , as well as , included a few with technical solutions expertise .   We reviewed past training and   messaging published to get a sense of what the current ask was .    We reviewed data around how many   technicians leave notes , on what type of jobs , what type of information does the note include , are there   some technicians that do this every time , some that never do it and what is the difference between   those technicians ?   We evaluated how the system presented the note field today , where it was in the   workflow , what was the verbiage and graphics around it , etc .   We then generated ideas to get   technicians to be committed to leave a note every time that included the specifics of what was done to   solve the problem they were sent there to solve .   However , we did limit ourselves to ensuring we   focused on making this simple and not adding time to the technicians job . 

 We came up with several good ideas and then picked the one we knew we could n’t do without .   We   tested our solution with a small group of technicians and found our assumptions were correct . Our   technicians embraced the new flow and tools and it was very apparent that giving them options of how   they will enter the note was very important ( ie , voice to text , text entry , picking from a defined list or a   combination of all options ) .   However , we discovered we did n’t spend enough time ensuring our testers   understood why the change was so important .   This was a huge discovery that we should have prepared   for as we readied the team for the test and is now something we are incorporating into the launch   package , but will be testing that through a Learning Launch first to confirm we have it just right . 

 Insight 

 The benefits to being able to perform a quick hands on experiment or test is a win for all involved .   Not   only were we able to confirm our assumption of what was needed , we also found that our oversight   around explaining the Why was a big miss .   In addition , the test allowed us to get our technicians   involved early and they quickly felt a sense of ownership and pride in helping to make this the best   solution it could be .   The learning lesson concept is truly a quick way to confirm if ideas make sense in   application not just on paper or in theory and if they will ultimately support the goal . 

 Approach 

 We are incorporating a bit of a different approach to our next learning launch for this same challenge by   incorporating <NAME> <NAME> into the launch .   We will focus more on benefits for the technician ( what ’s in   it for them ) and to tell that story in many different ways to support different learning types such as   visual , aural and verbal .   While we can easily modify our systems to support technicians entering notes   in many different ways and can make the note a mandatory field the bottom line is we still need the   technician to feel compelled to leave a note that accurately describes what was done to fix an issue .   In   order to drive this behavior we will tell a story to reach people emotionally in a way that ensures   genuine commitment to the cause , engaging their hearts as well as their minds in our call to action ,   making them feel as if they are part of a game changing program . 

"
"Reflection – Visualization 

 I am working in the technical team . I will be working on gathered old information for finding the data   relationship and creation of searching <NAME> APIs . This application is useful for internal purpose . 

 Challenge & Selection 

 The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization , or Visual Thinking , to achieve a shared understanding   of a problem space among a diverse group of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define   possible solutions to the problem . Based on visualization we are finding the defects to fix our problems .   This visualization we are using to gather more number of users . I have used the technique of using a   straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for discussion to allow a   diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope , boundaries ,   key elements , and relationships between elements to consider when identifying pain points and   opportunities for improvements or solutions . 

 Application 

 I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain . To develop the straw man   graphic , I will draw from any existing material available to understand the environment . The existing   material may be operational or procedural documents , training materials , marketing materials , GAO or   other auditing reports . For the activity , I will take the suggestions and improvements from the team   members . Based on those will create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed   changes that they agreed to as a group . 

 Insight & Approach 

 We have learned that by practicing this training with our team members , we can analyze data from   various viewpoints , reduce missing information and enhance understanding / share opinions quickly   depending on how much we utilize visualization tools . In the next project , we will make quick use of the   visualization tools to quickly and easily share opinions in the organization through simple graphs and   charts , so that we can quickly resolve any issues that arise . 

"
"Reflection ( Storytelling -Module 2 )    <NAME> <NAME> 

 REFLECTION ON STORYTELLING TOOL 

 Challenge & Selection   Storytelling is a fundamental aspect of every great brand . Every great brand has a story to tell   and each story connects to the emotions and the values of the people that live that product   every day . Storytelling is the difference between solving a problem and creating a cause . Why   did I choose this tool ? For me , I work as a healthcare marketer overseeing products that   serves the adult population with medical conditions . My main role includes build the visibility   of our products among the healthcare professionals to drive recommendations and build   awareness of the role of supplementary nutrition to the adult population . In the healthcare   channels , competitor ’s brand presence is very strong , and we have minimal product   superiority , we are just a “ me - too ” product . To add on the challenge level , the loyalty level of   doctors toward competitors is strong . Competitors have been very aggressive and consistent   in their brand communications and visibility to healthcare professionals and population . 

 As for the population , it is rather a sensitive topic to communicate about “ being sick ” and one   needed some form of supplementation of nutritional support . The link between the benefits   and need is rather lacking . People usually wo nt proactively search for ways to prevent that ,   they will only take a proactive approach when they notice changes in their health or being   advised by a healthcare professional . Another aspect that makes my role challenging is that   there is always misalignment , for instance , the head of department will instruct us to focus   only on Product Y but at the business update session , the management will want us to focus   on everything . We have been changing our key messaging and value proposition . There is no   focus and we are under - staffed with limited resources . The management has been pressuring   us to de - average , be more innovative and deliver higher sales each year with constant   decreasing allocated marketing budget . This course and exercise might help me discover new   ways to improve our communications to build drive our business . 

 Application   This tool might be helpful in helping me build a better brand plan for second half of the year .   As mentioned in the lecture itself , there is a few things that I will need to take note to create a   good story . Firstly , I need to know my audience well , for this , I might need to initiate a   brainstorming session to gather the necessary information to map out what my audience   wants and needs . It can also help to determine the preferred mode of communication . 

 Secondly , I will need to have a clear sequence of events that help me move the story from the   beginning to an end . Based on the insights , I might be able to draft out the story for my   product , it could be raising the awareness of poor nutrition first followed by the outcome and   how they can prevent or manage it . It ’s like a sequence of events and thoughts . Lastly , I will   include some moments of reflections to evaluate if there are still questions unanswered that   could potentially build suspense and intrigue . It is pivotal for me to create a compelling story   that tells the benefits and needs of my product . I wo n’t be able to evaluate if it is effective now   but as we kickstart this , we will be able to measure the impact it has on the business . 

 Insight    As I have not implemented this tool into work . But I would anticipate that this will be a good   exercise . Currently , we do not gather insights of our audience and we just communicate the   way we feel it ’s right ; we been experimenting the best way . And , to be very honest , it is tiring   as the idea that works for now might not work the next round . We been tweaking things as we   go . It is like “ test - and - learn ” approach . I would anticipate that this will make us more focused ,   wise spending and the outcome will be desired . 

 Approach    After this exercise , I might want to do another version with visualization tool just to find out   which tool works better as there is no one size fits all . Visualization can make the idea more   concrete and visible , clear and understandable . I could even incorporate both storytelling and   visualization together in my communication materials to the population as the content must be   easy to understand , easy to follow through yet impactful .

"Reflection – Storytelling 

 Link between research and commercial 

 products / services 

 Challenge 

 The main problem that I face in the research institution I work for as a Business Development   Manager is the lack of understanding of potential outcomes of research projects which can be   used to develop new products . Many of my team members have an academic background ,   i.e. working as PhD or Post - docs with less industry experience . Therefore , their first priority is   to work on research projects and focus more on theoretical concepts rather than practical   concepts . However , in my case , I am responsible to derive potential products / services from   those research projects which is indeed a very difficult task and requires great imagination   power .      Selection   Based on the challenges described above , I chose the tool “ Storytelling ” since it will allow   me to create a story on particular outcome of research projects by putting them more into the   context of customer needs of industry clients ( referring to lecture 4 of week 2 , “ Storytelling   tool ” by <NAME> <NAME> ) . This would help to make my team members better understand the real   value behind the products / services which can help industry clients to reduce certain pain   points with less efforts . 

 Application   I applied the “ Storytelling ” tool in the following scenario :     Some of my colleagues work in the area of semantic data integration of big data . In the scope   of one specific research project the task was to create a semantic hybrid federated search   engine which would make it possible for the police to detect and trace potential criminals .      A short explanation on how the search engine works :   Following the input of a keyword , the search engine collects on demand data spread over   different data sources on the Web ( social networks , e - commerce platforms , Open Data ) . The   data is integrated into a coherent knowledge graph , results can be filtered , visualized and   display summaries . Currently , it is possible to search for people , organizations , and products .      This research project is still going on and lot of modification and adjustment are made to the   search engine . In order to create a commercial product out of this research project I spend   some time in analyzing the potential of this search engine and tried to find an appropriate way   to “ sell ” it as a unique product to the sales team by packaging it into a nice and user - friendly   story . I brainstormed on potential application areas of this product in order to move away from 

 the already known use case , i.e. the criminal analysis . In this way , I would open up new   opportunities / ideas for the development team .      New application area : Why not use this search engine in the HR department of companies .   HR officers spend much time gathering information about the skills and qualification of a   candidate for a job ( e.g. by searching on different platforms like LinkedIn ) . This problem can   be solved if those platforms are integrated to the search engine , allowing to search on just   ONE platform by browsing through many others .      I organized a workshop in which I invited the sales and development team and presented this   new application area by taking the role of a struggling HR manager searching for the right   people for his company and finally , getting to know about the semantic hybrid search engine   which allowed me to search on one platform and saved me a lot of time . I started with the   challenge or problem faced by HR managers , followed by a concrete use case , i.e. HR   manager is struggling and investing lot of time in searching for a suitable candidate for the   post of a Chief Innovation Officer . In the next step , the HR Manager discovers the great   semantic hybrid search engine enabling him to search on one platform and finding a good   match for the position . I concluded by highlighting the benefits of this product not only in the   crime domain but also in other domains like Human Resource Management . 

 Insight   I gained tremendous insights from applying the tool I selected for the challenge . Using this   approach , almost everyone in the workshop had a better understanding of the ideas and   participated with more interest on this particular use case . The development team   brainstormed on further enhancements with other platforms , i.e. <ADDRESS> . And , the sales team   took the role of the struggling HR Manager by elaborating on his / her pain in more depth . In   this way , the development team could easily respond to each of those pains by brainstorming   on technical adjustments / enhancement of the search engine . In conclusion , the development   team could focus on the technical modifications to create real value for potential customers   whereas the sales team successfully worked on a pitch for different customer groups . 

 Approach 

 Using the “ storytelling ” tool has been a great start . However , the next time I would organize a   follow - up workshop using the tool “ mind mapping ” . I would create one group consisting of   developers and the other one with the sales team . Both teams can use the stories and enrich   them with further insights by creating mind maps . They might explore more application areas   and opportunities for this product to reach a certain level of maturity . These maps can be   shared among the two different groups and also with others in our department to analyse the   different point of views and the further alignment to the departmental vision and goals .

"Heart Failure Care - Less than Ideal circumstances ! 

 Challenge 

 The challenge in this situation was the medical Care of Heart Failure patients . We work with this largely   elderly , vulnerable and mostly economically challenged type of patients among other cardiac patients .   This type of illness has a high mortality rate and severely compromises the patient ’s quality of life .   Nevertheless , so much could be done given the appropriate follow up and medications . 

 Due to the capacity of the staff , given that we have other patients to attend to , and the limited resources   we lost a considerable portion of those patients mainly because of loss to follow up . 

 Selection 

 We have applied a learning launch of a dedicated Heart Failure Team where there is a specific referral   room purely assigned to heart failure patients . The concept was to overcome the limitations that we have   by dedicating two days / week where we only focus our efforts to this particular type of patients . The team   should consist of all the required professionals starting with trained nurse , a clinical pharmacist , cardiac   rehabilitation specialist , a psychologist and doctor . 

 The reason we selected to launch this trial ; is the fact that we knew from our patients they wanted more   than merely a quick review of medication and clinical status . They have felt the previous method looked at   them as files and prescriptions more than patients that deserve better life quality . We knew we had to   develop a more tailored system that fits their needs . 

 Application 

 Following that we have organized ourselves and approached the management with the project .   Unfortunately , there was no convenient room available . Therefore , we have agreed to use a room utilized   by colleagues from another department after their scheduled hours and only once a week , the week   following this approval we started telling a portion of our patients about the dedicated clinic and the   available hours and three weeks later we started . 

 Insight 

 The basics to this is that instead of the patient meeting only one type of health care practitioner this   patient would be able to meet all the relevant ones as to guide and help . In the first month , more than   85 % of the patients came back for the scheduled follow up visits as compared to about 35 - 40 % using the   conventional way . The patients ’ feedback was they had a considerable improvement in their lives and   they were now able to do activities they never thought they were ever able to do again . Even though it   was a success from the patients perspective , it was a struggle for us as staff . The fact that we had to   move other activities and patients from this day made the rest of the weekdays even more loaded , they   were also days that the room was not available on time because our colleagues patients either ran late or   had un - foreseen issues that required more time to deal with . 

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 We are currently in trial to develop a more convenient approach to this problem without jeopardizing the   patient satisfaction we had so far . Given the limited resources we have and the number of staff members ,   it is highly questioned that we would be able to create a dedicated team and premises to this . Therefore ,   it is up for us to create a convenient schedule that would best fit all , the team and the patients .

"Visualization 

 Challenge & Selection 

 I started with the tool of Visualization to focus the problem and find the right solution to solve it . I   apply thi technique with collegues to identify the right procedure for sodding the needs of my   administration with regard to the provision of goods and services . I implement this process by   identifying a range of goods and services and indicating for each of these the positives and negatives   that may exist if the procurement process is completed .   I have created a set of questions that I   bring to the attention of the employees of the department concerned by the purchase to match   their needs with the characteristics of the asset . The purchase process is initiated when the positive   aspects of the asset meet the needs of the department that needs the asset and , in general , the   needs of the entire administration . 

 Application 

 The process begins with the drafting of a document that contains the characteristics of the good or   service , the technical data , the possible applications , the costs , the fields of use . Subsequently I   insert in the document a series of test questions on the utility of that good and I insert a comparison   between different models of the same good . Once narrowed down the range of choice I conduct   direct interviews with managers of the department interested in the purchase . In last contact the   marketing managers , sales and the suppliers of the chosen products in order to obtain information   on the conditions of sale and on the availability to eventually apply of the discounts in case of   purchase . 

 The most important questions I ask department staff are : 1 ) What is the use of the asset in question ;   2 ) What characteristics do you prefer the asset to have ? 

 Subsequently , I apply a skim of the goods object of the selection and I ask the attache 's to indicate   to me which would be their choice and the reason of this choice , indicating also the information   that I have collected from the producers of the good . 

 Insight and approach 

 By applying this method , I immediately realize the needs of each department and am able to guide   the purchase we are about to make as an administration . The process allows departmental staff to   focus on their true needs , thoroughly analyzing whether the characteristics of the asset can "" meet ""   those needs . 

 The information contained in the document makes it possible to arrive at a rapid identification of   the best goods and to quickly make contact with the producers to define the aspects inherent in the   purchase which , in the end , will constitute fundamental information for the final choice of the good   to be purchased . 

 It is important to review the entire process after the purchase , in order to collect feedback on the   quality of the purchased goods from the departmental staff and to verify whether the goods actually   meet the needs highlighted in the process .

"Challenge & Selection      <NAME> <NAME> , who has muscular discomfort , is one of the biggest fans of Trabzonspor . His   biggest dream was to score a goal for Trabzonspor one day . I wanted to realize <NAME> 's dreams   to show how 5 G technology will remove the limits . In order to introduce such technology , I   wanted to make a little kid 's dreams come true . Then I planned all our work and infrastructure   accordingly .     Application     For this , I used storytelling tool which I believe is the most appropriate one for this case . I   used VR glasses and microphones so that <NAME> can direct the football player instantly . <NAME>   instantly saw the camera attached to the football player and directed him and scored his dream   goal . Thus , I realized <NAME> 's dream of scoring beautiful goals like Trabzonspor players , one of   his biggest dreams .    Before the 3 December Disabled Day , all work was done in the Trabzonspor training field ,   preparations were completed . Thanks to 5 G technology , <NAME> saw the field with VR glasses   at a delay rate of only 1 - 10 milliseconds through <NAME> 's eyes , and he scored <NAME> <NAME>   with the commands he gave !     Insight & Approach     Beginning from the moment it was released , my ad film got supported by every football club   and their fans alongside Trabzonspor . On TV and digital we reached 10,3 million people in   total , with 689 thousand impressions and 2,5 million views . Our # PeopleHaveNoBoundaries   hashtag became TT on <NAME> and shared for 3.6 thousand times .   <ADDRESS> ’s most prominent   TV channels , 19 newspapers and 144 news sites announced <NAME> ’s goal on their news   broadcasts . What I might do differently next time is that I would plan my mind mapping in a   more specific way . But I am sure I ’d use storytelling tool again .

"Example Reflection – Learning Launch 

 Challenge 

 I work in a biomedical biotechnology company in the Projects Management Department and our   team members are dedicated to plan , evaluate , manage and monitor R&D projects ( external and   internal projects from the company ) , catch new investors and improve constantly and efficiently   our clinical services and celular manufacturing processes with the highest quality standards and   technologies nationwide . 

 Currently , we started as a challenge a new laboratory implementation project to establish a bigger   space and brand - new equipments to improve by triplicate our internal processes ( such as clinical   services , and celular manufacturing production ) . The scope of the project is divided into two   phases : The first phase of Construction / Execution , is considered to be made in 60 business days   ( including demolition , labour force , physical remodeling and functional basic service systems such   as water , gas , electricity , and two unique isolated air conditioners ; One exclusive for a Cryogenic   Area , and the other for the rest of the laboratory . ) The second phase of <ADDRESS> , Testing and   Closing , is considered to be made in another 20 days to evaluate the full operational flow of the   laboratory ( including the staff workflow timing , quality / quantity of the finished product , and   celular / molecular external services from the clinic such as DNA amplification ) . 

 Selection 

 Our team already used design thinking tools during brainstorming and the elaboration of the   creative process to articulate the layout of the new laboratory such as <NAME> ( to develop a   plan focused on our key clients needs and welfare , such as medics from external / internal   hospitals , clinics and patients ) and MindMapping to explore , find and expand possible patterns   that could improve our design criteria and the vision of our challenge with more sustainable   services and products to our stakeholders , including their personal needs with different tests   ( surveys , collages , drawings , scale schemes , qualitative / quantitative records , etc ) . Therefore , after   we made a wide repertoire of information , we selected the Learning Launch Design Tool to test   our assumptions and scale the first phase of the project into the real world . 

 Application 

 Since we still in the first phase , this was focused on the Construction / Execution challenges . We   already structured the tasks , subtasks , technical and operational team , equipment requirements   for each area , costs , risks , acquisitions , delivery terms , quality control assignments , and flow   communications within the areas with a matrix process in order to have an agile global vision of   the whole project . All our information and assumptions , made us realize that our operational team   was not highly prepared for the use of the new - brand equipments for the operational area and   they submitted to a three - day external induction service in order to learn what they are going to   use in they workday . After they finished their course , they went to see the new laboratory area in   order to seek and evaluate ( by a formal survey ) what are their minimally functional needs to work 

 comfortably and efficiently , proposed equipments , personal feelings , etc . They had noticed that   the operational area does not had the best ventilation and temperature for coworkers and the   product itself . This let us got a high performance particle / temperature isolation system to certify   the quality / safety of the product and the tranquility of our coworkers to be able and insure   efficiently . 

 Insight 

 When we applied the learning launch tool , our team identified all our assumptions in order to ask   ourselves what we know , what we do n’t know , what we need to know and how we learn what we   need to know . All our information repertoire and actual results , served us as a guide to understand   our personal stakeholders ( coworkers ) needs . 

 Since they are the core of the company , this insight led us to prioritize our team in this stage . Their   work wellness , will let us provide the best solutions and services for the second phase of the   project and incorporate them into future launch designs , as well as other key stakeholders   involved directly with a high impact . 

 Approach 

 As a team , we could apply this tool into the next phase of the project in order to evaluate the full   operational flow of the laboratory with the new changes of our team needs . In addition , this   insight could be applied in future launch designs focused on marketing the product to customers   according our business model ( doctors or patients ) , investors or other stakeholders in scientific   seminars , global biotechnology events or trade shows with consistent solutions .

"Boiling- Visualization 

 Challenge 

 To develop mathematical model for simulation of boiling process with my four PG students was the   challenge I made . This is one year project for students with aim to improve heat transfer in distillation   process . First thing is to use visualisation tool . 

 Selection 

 Heat transfer enhancement in boing is an objective to meet . Here simulation process can help which   parameters are important factors in deciding their contribution . Before going for mathematical model .   Understanding of process is more important . For this visualisation tool is used . Unless we visualise the   process of boiling we will not be able to interpret the results of simulation .   So boiling a water in a pan   is visualised first . Then parameters involved in the process are listed . 

 Application 

 Application of this innovation is in distillation process where once we understand the parameter and   its percentage involvement in boiling process , we can meter the process with less energy input and   that will help the distillation industry a lot in energy saving . 

 Insight 

 There are physical properties involved in the process including density , specific heat , conductivity etc .   They are to be visualised first to understand their contribution in boiling process . Then a mathematical   model is required to be built to accommodate all such parameters . The gap analysis is essential in all   this process . 

 Approach 

 After visualisation each member in the group is asked to narrate what he has seen in visualisation   about different parameters and then asked to prepare mathematical model as per his / her thought .   This model is synthesised for best possible result . 

 Organization 

 This way of gap analysis and creative visualisation gave result with new additive in distillation process .   The concept visualisation , gap analysis , partial model building and synthesis can come up with creative   thinking process .

"The Rise of an opportunity 

 Challenge and Selection . 

 The tool I used in my experiment is <NAME> <NAME> . As described in the <NAME> , “ it is looking for patterns   and insights in large quantity of data one has collected during the exploration of ‘ What Is ’ . ” In my line of   work on Supply Chain Logistics ,   for several years our ways of doing have remained traditional . A big chunk   of our operations model remained the same . But the company reviewed the essential concerns in our   decision processes that may have direct impact to either cost or customer satisfaction . I have gathered   enough data and see the interlaying concerns both the company and the customer may have and identified   this as the project ’s common goal . With <NAME> <NAME> tool , the team I worked with , hope to establish a   criteria as we proceed with the ‘ What If ’ idea generation phase as we continue to explore the possibility of   tweaking the way we do things in <ADDRESS> . 

 Application . 

 We begin by identifying the ‘ What is ’ phase . Really laying out all the information we have currently . The   team had to understand the present indicators we have , that affect our department ’s performance   including Lead Time , Cost , and Delivery Compliance . During this part , as the module may call as “ Journey   Mapping ” , every detail available in all the information fields must be understood thoroughly to help pin   point the factors the causes the problem and the effect of each to the entire scope . 

 Soon as we have obtained commonalities , we have to continue being creative and step out of our usual   planning state of mind . This brought us to realizing a new business platform driving growth and attraction   for the new set of customers – E - Commerce . This platform suggests the availability of goods anywhere and   anytime which only means in a Supply Chain – Logistics stand point , operations must be agile and quick to   respond . And this is not impossible , as new transport models are available i.e. Motorcycles , Motorbikes , or   even customized delivery boxes attached to smaller vehicles are made , increasing their agility to deliver .   Clearly , this new Operations Model in the rise may be catering to a B2C or <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> ,   but the creative process of <NAME> <NAME> may suggest that such , may also be worth considering to the   way we cater now to our customers which is a B2B , <NAME> to Customer business model . 

 Insight and Approach . 

 The practice of <NAME> <NAME> allowed me to gain a new perspective to innovate the way I have always   looked at data and perhaps challenge current infrastructures . 

 The experiment conducted here , have been tested to prove its theoretical assumptions and ultimately   prove its concept to an ever changing business land - scape . This was done with several test and learn   approaches while backed up with data to identify where to begin the testing . Furthermore , the experiment   continues to seek new findings to present at a ‘ Brainstorming ’ session where collective insights from the   team and experiential learning were carefully considered

"Topic : Mind mapping through ideation 

 1 . Challenge : 

 To discover a new innovative way to use solar energy . Solar energy can replace non - renewable   energy , but there are some barriers that it has to cross . The acceptance by the people , and the   logistics of delivery of solar power has confused marketers . Hence a product that can overcome   these barriers and create a need for solar energy , and achieve acceptance in the society . 

 2 . Selection : 

 I have chosen the tool of mind mapping for my analysis . As it can help to build a storyboard with key   words , and their association can lead to ideas . 

 3 . Application : 

 We can map out the various terms around solar energy first , which gives us the 

    benefits of solar energy , 

    the delivery logistics , 

    cost of installing solar energy , 

    consumer , and 

    other barriers . 

 We can now further divide each of these subtopics into key words , so consumer can get divided into , 

    consumer expectations , 

    consumer knowledge , 

    consumer acceptance , and 

    the demographic information . 

 Each of these keywords can further be divided , for example consumer acceptance can be further   divided into : 

    Welcomes the change and 

    Rejects the change . 

 4 . Insight : 

 This gives us insight on the fact that all places might not be open to accepting solar energy , hence   based on the demographic research we should target only those cities which have high level of   educational qualification , welcomes the change and technology of solar power , and can afford to   make an investment in the planet . 

 5 Approach : 

 I would make a diagram or an actual creative art sheet to present my mind map , for better ideas and   higher clarity .

"Reflection – Mind mapping and Personalization or Human   centric information delivery     Challenge    I worked in the Energy sector for nearly 15 years , particularly in the field of   Information Technology and Digital Transformation .   A fundamental aspect of   digital transformation is the concept of the implementation and use disruptive   technology . This is driven by business change .   My industry is notoriously   slow to react to new technological advances . As the default believe is – why   should they create uncertainty or risk in a industry - which makes so many   billions every year . I am <NAME> <NAME> ( agile ) and many more elements ,   which are considered as anti to the existing practices in our Industry sector . I   say that with complete sincerity – and even our internal processes for   securing resources or development do not allow us to adapt and inspect in an   agile way . The whole of having to drill a well which can cost upwards of one   million dollars loss per day , means that only the waterfall method of project   delivery is considered safe .   Against this cultural backdrop I try and bring new   and proven successfully frameworks to the business and explain them in a   visual way .       Selection   So , to approach the business client and bring about culture change in way   which the typical business using can understand , I use a concept from   Knowledge Management called knowledge café ’s – and collaborative   brainstorming . This is all visualized by a large mind map on the digital screen   based around what we are trying to improve upon .   Even the concept of Mind   Mapping is new to some fields .   You have to imagine that not every business   is familiar with such concepts .   But I do find that after the workshops people   ask me about mindmapping and I actually give the links to free tools and   youtube videos .     Application   The plan was to get the key stakeholders and business users into split varied   groups .   In this course I will use the example of   “ Personalization or Human   centric information delivery ” . This is basically about the fact that any large   enterprise has key critical documents , processes and guidelines – which   every employee is supposed to keep up to date with .   Let ’s call this – the   Corporate management System .   However , 1 process alone on Health And 

 Safety – could involve 1000 pages split across multiple documents and   document types .   The Challenge is to push the information to the right people   in the right roles and activities .   For instance .   If there is a new legal ruling that   hoisting must involving at least 3 people present – all wearing safety gear .   Then the people in the field need to know this to save lives . If this information   – even if updated is stuck inside a mountain of paperwork – then it has no   value .   We actually measured the rate of usage to key documents and it was   incredibly low .         Insight   We have had a few workshops and created the typical plans and concepts    and mapped out the key building blocks to how we can push this information   to the users . However , we started to bring in more people from different area   to get their feedback – and this included contractors .   Now , in this company of   59000 people . Only 8000 are direct hires , the rest are contractors , who do not   have access to our internal systems .   One contract joined the workshop and   was very intense on every aspect of the Mind Map which we were   collaboratively working on .   He amazingly pointed out the biggest gap or lets   say failure of our Linear understandings . 

  The absolutely need for external anonymous access to the key 

 approved information and its ability for the key points to be understood   in multiple languages . 

  Most contractors out in the field do not have access to internal system    Most contractors are activity not role based , So for instance , a 

 <ADDRESS> might be doing one activity one day and another completely   the other day . 

  The need to have cheat sheets which can be printed out – time stamped 

 with the latest procedures . 

 Approach   In hindsight , we approached this from business key stakeholders – i.e.   managers and directors , and only got to the actual workers mid process .    What I would say is next time I would source some key champions from the   actual workforce and bring them into the mapping sessions .   We have also   implemented a continuous improvement and realization element to each   project – whereby users can collaborate on versions of the mind map with   comments and these are reviewed at the end of each sprint .

"ASSIGNMENT RUBRIC – LEARNING LAUNCH 

 CHALLENGE 

 I decided to use the Design Thinking method for a personal project . I´ve explained one chapter of 

 my career thesis . Through this knowledge I could demonstrate how I´ve made all the design 

 process to get the final project step by step . This project took at least one year to get to this point 

 of development . This study was a Fashion design one and the topic was “ Genderless tendence ” . 

 <ADDRESS> 

 Although I applied all the several tools , processes and activities for this project , I am going to 

 develop how I implemented the learning launch because this shows as an experiment meant to 

 quickly test an idea and the creation of a prototype . 

 APPLICATION 

 In this instance it was proposed the generation of possible options to the creation of the solution 

 to a specific problem . In this case , the problem posed was the stereotypical fashion on gender 

 issues . 

 The first stage was formalizing the idea proposing the projection of the project . Then , the critical 

 valoration in where it was put in on trial the good and the bad aspects , to make decisions . What 

 happened next was to determine a user profile to know what were the characteristics to work . In 

 that way , it was evaluated and selected the style of working and it was possible to check with the 

 user to accept or decline the proposal .   At the same time it was made the search for alternative 

 technologies to otorgue the development of the product with the right technology . 

 The next stage was the prototype , and for this instance it was proposed the construction of a 

 previous production model to help the interpretation in a practical context of the first idea or 

 concept . The first thing it has made was some sketch - draws that will give shape to the idea on 

 paper . What happened next was the experimentation of proportions , volumes and details of the 

 sharp ( 2D , 3D ) . In this case , a model was made to verify and exemplify the real size and materia 

 INSIGHT 

 By applying the learning launch tool , I became a more organized persona and not only in practical 

 aspects for this project . It produced a more clean visualization at the time of putting all the ideas 

 on the table . With this kind of test the risk of unexpected results was reduced . With prototypes and 

 tests everything that could be an experience with objectives other than those expected became a 

 successful possible final model . With this Design thinking tool it was possible to innovate the way 

 thinking and acting , thus continually generating questions about the truths and model needs that 

 instill them , seeking innovation rather than repetition . 

 APPROACH 

 For this project I have already gone through exceptional design thinking tools , the learning launch 

 was one of them and it was a relevant option for this project . With these tools it was possible to 

 identificate failures to resolve , significant improvements or possible deficiencies on   premature 

 time to the correct development of the final production .

"Learning Launch Tool 

 1 . Challenge : 

 Working as a leader in R&D organization of machining software company , I am never short of   ideas in our group . Hundreds are generated when we get team together to brainstorm on any   topic . Challenge is always selecting right few to proceed with and doing that selection without   technology , execution or individual biases . 

 In this specific case , we had gathered ideas on simplifying steps in providing tolerance values on   the part , so that machining allowance / errors wo nt exceed the limits even after considering worst   possible scenario . Let me take help of below figure to explain the process . Each plate has   tolerance as mentioned below . If you take worst case , i.e. each tolerance limit staying on positive   max , then overall tolerance for X will be summation of all positive worst - case tolerances . In   assembly , typically you have overall tolerance and then need to reverse calculate permissible   tolerance for each part to stay within limits . 

 Now imagine complex assembly with multiple parts which have holes , fillets , or shapes which are   not rectangular . Tolerance calculation keeps becoming complex and it becomes very   cumbersome process for user of our software to input it meaningfully . In machining , you have to   compute and adjust for these tolerances to meet overall fitment of the part within assembly for   given functionality . 

 2 . Selection : 

 Team came out with multiple approaches that can possibly simplify this interaction and we   shortlisted three of them as most promising based on our internal criteria . These approaches   varied on controls it provided to user to finetune their inputs for various scenario ( maximum   functionality ) versus asking minimum intervention from user and product making assumptions on   their behalf ( minimum UI ) . 

 Then we decided to select <NAME> <NAME> tool to experiment with these three approaches to   come out with best possible one for final implementation . 

 3 . Application : 

 We build quick and dirty simulated prototype of these approaches in less than 2 weeks of efforts   and exposed them to ~18 customers / users who had volunteered to work with us to improve our   productline . 

 We developed ‘ customer satisfaction index ’ ( CSI ) survey for evaluation with criteria like if   proposed solutions meets their need , is it easier to use , what they most liked about this particular   approach . We exposed our quick and dirty simulated prototypes to them through cloud VM and   also observed their usage through video calls . We asked them to fill these CSI survey after   roughly allowing 20 mins play time for them . Each user had to spend roughly 30 min of its total   time for the same including documenting their feedback for ~10min . 

 4 . Insight : 

 This exercise resulted in surprise findings for us . None of the three was clear winner in terms of   distinct leader in CSI index . Users like simplicity of the approach where we did n’t ask them too   many inputs , but wanted deeper control over functionality for their real world parts and their   variations . Due to insight gained from our learning launch experiment , we developed new   approach altogether where we provided simplicity of making assumptions on behalf of users to   generate default output for most cases , but then allowing to go back and launch detailed controls   for few cases . This detailed UI was required to be invoked only in rare cases to provide different   values than what software has calculated . 

 This approach was like combining best of all worlds – no UI and default output for 80 % of   scenarios , but ability to go back provide details for 20 % cases where unique inputs are required ,   and more functionality needs to be exposed . Our users loved this approach when it was launched   finally after few more confirmation trials . 

 5 . Approach : 

 Clearly keeping open mind in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> phase and allowing customers / users provide all   possible feedback is important . We quickly learned none of our shortlisted ideas were great , but   could develop new one based on feedback from these experiment that allowed us to provide   innovative solution that could help our customer .

"VISUALIZATION 

 Challenge 

 I ’m a management student and I have to suggest an idea to grow a clothing 

 company , “ U.S. Department of Defense ” , the challenge consist in expand the market , basically the 

 company consists of selling clothes only online . This has made it one of the most 

 popular online clothing stores . My idea is to open physical stores to solve some 

 of the problems that consumers have when using the application . This project is 

 carried out individually and I have to present excellent results . 

 Selection 

 I select the visualization tool because I consider that visualization role to play 

 throughout the design process or the development process . It ’s an incredible tool , 

 in that sense , in that we ’re using those , those tools , that part of your brain , at 

 each phase in the design process . Designers use the visualization all the time . 

 Finally it ’s a key component in our way of communicating . 

 Application 

 For the application of the visualization tool , I first began to investigate which 

 problems the customer have when buying online and then based on the results I 

 began imagining options that will help solve consumer problems . First I visualized 

 opening physical stores so that consumers could measure their clothes 

 immediately , this by solving the first problem in turn we would be solving the 

 second problem which was avoiding long waits to receive the product since this 

 company is characterized by the fact that orders take time in be delivered . Then 

 I thought that these stores would have to have marketing of all kinds and be 

 located in strategic points , the brand is already recognized but expanding the 

 scope would be more . I finally thought of including discounts for consuming 

 physically to grow the stores obviously not leaving the part of online purchases in 

 oblivion since the only thing that is sought is to solve the problems of the 

 consumer by obtaining advantages in sale . 

 Information 

 I found the application of the visualization tool extremely useful as it broadened 

 my panorama by selecting the problems that consumers had in order to develop 

 a plan that would solve the case . Before starting this challenge , I thought that this 

 tool was the most suitable for me and during the process I was able to confirm it , 

 it really was very easy to conclude , I liked that my mind was working all the time 

 and this allowed me to be more inspired .   In my challenge I talked about 

 innovating , and this is a very good tool to put a positive spin on the company . 

 Focus 

 It would possibly change that at times I thought a lot about what I wanted to write 

 or reflect that because I had many ideas he forgot it . Possibly writing my ideas 

 would have worked for me not to forget details . In general , I considered that 

 despite the aforementioned changes , it is a good tool to apply

 <NAME> <NAME> 

 CHALLENGE   Describe your challenge , including all relevant information .   I advise people in their work transitions as they navigate from one job to the other .   In some   cases , people want to take advantage of the transition to think about doing something else ,   something different , from what they´ve been doing in the past .   This is often not easy to pin   down , especially when people have many interests or there is fear or doubt .   My challenge was   to facilitate their thinking about career possibilities by using Design Thinking techniques .   In line   with what was taught in class , I tried reframing the challenge beyond career possibilities to   expand it and include what is that they really want in life .      SELECTION In your own words , briefly describe the tool you selected ( what it is and why you   selected it , including video references ) .     I selected the Visualization Tool , which is the representation of thoughts through images such   as photos , drawings , collages , etc .   I chose it because of its ability to “ unlock different parts of   the brain and access parts we normally don´t use during conversation , ” and enrich the   exploration phase , as discussed by Ana Meyer ( designer ) , in the lecture video .      A second benefit I saw in utilizing the Visualization Tool is that it would allow me to take out the   guess work in the process , by helping me actually “ see ” what the subjects were envisioning .     And , because it would help keep me focused on exploring as well ( vs. directing ) as we worked   through the images and questions .        APPLICATION      I used a number of visualization tools which turned out to be effective .   I started out with the   Wheel of Life exercise , which is essentially a circle divided into categories important to one´s   life , such as family , work , etc . , where the person has to rate their current level of satisfaction   ( see image below ) .   I then asked them to do the same exercise in another wheel , but projecting   their ideal satisfaction levels in the same categories .   Once completed , we reviewed the results ,   and left the tool aside for later reflection . 

 Wheel of Life 

 Source :   coactive.com 

 As homework , I asked them to do a mood board or collage , consisting of images , texts , etc . ,   much in line with what we saw in class lectures , focused on today and 3 - 5 years from now .   This   exercise was a freer exercise , with a wider scope , as they could include interests , dreams ,   success factors , inspiration , or any images that resonated with them as they thought where   they are now and where they wanted to be in the future .        We spent a lot of time understanding and discussing the ideas and inspirations .   We then put   the collage up , and looked at it from afar and try to see connections , mood , colors , and things   that resonated most .   We then tried to unify the canvass learnings or insights with the life   wheel ecercise .   For example , we tried to how some of the items in the collage would add   satisfaction to levels to the original Life Wheel by sticking Post - its with the activity or dream in   the respective category .   We then chose the categories where the “ collage ” post - its raised the   satisfaction levels to that sought in sought in the second , “ Ideal ” , life wheel .     INSIGHT     I found visualization very effective and powerful because it allowed us to play around , question   assumptions , and spark conversations that allowed us to actually feel the energy levels behind   certain activities or situations in the collage .   It was also easier to detect common themes and   powerful insights easier .   For example , we saw a lot of outdoor activities that generated   conversations around certain criteria in a new career that <ADDRESS> been considered before .       Since it was the first time I was doing this , and playing with post - its , I was a little bit out of my   comfort zone , but it was interesting to see that the participants were not .   They were actually   enjoying the discovery exercise .   I also wasn´t sure if we had broadened the challenge correctly ,   but I kept on thinking , “ if it doesn´t work , you tweak ” , and we ended up working our way   through .     APPROACH Describe what you might do differently next time , applying the same tool you   sleected or a different one , and the reasons why .      Next time , I would certainly use visualization .   What I would do differently is play around to try   different variants and see what works and flows better .   This will help me identify which specific   tools I should use for specific types of situations .   Secondly , I need to work more on   “ broadening the problem ” as I think is critical , but have a hard time knowing whether we are   reframing it correctly .   Keeping focus on the task is important as I found that I would go off on   tangents a lot , and needed to reel us in to keep focused and get the ideas flowing to finish the   task .

 DESIGN THINKING FOR 

 INNOVATION - PEER - GRADED   ASSIGNMENT : REFLECTION 

 Challenge : 

 I work as a senior analyst at Abu Dhabi Quality and Conformity Council ( QCC ) . My role is to 

 gather and interpret data of different clients in order to suggest reasonable actions . However , I face 

 a few challenges that come in my way to produce the best strategies . One major challenge is the 

 relationship of some performance indicators with the strategic objectives of external parties , as 

 well as the absence of a timely response from the relevant parties . Sometimes the quality 

 performance indicators differ from the strategic objectives of external parties which results in 

 certain discrepancies . Similarly , another challenge is the delay in the delivery of scorecards in 

 some sectors due to their working association with other third party service providers . This 

 challenge results in a delayed outcome from our organization as well because of the overall delay . 

 Such delays can also ultimately impact the quality performance of those sectors , when they fail to 

 deliver on time . 

 Selection : 

 As per the challenges mentioned above , I used the storytelling tool in order to understand the 

 objectives of their parties and at the same time compel them to switch to better alternatives by 

 emphasizing on the stories and their positive outcomes . 

 Application : 

 In order to deal with the challenges , I used the storytelling tool . I started by telling the relevant 

 parties a story in which a company failed to reach its optimum production capacity and outcomes 

 because of its poor performance indicators that did not match with the strategic objectives of that 

 company . I was able to empathize with them and know their challenges in detail , so that I could 

 provide them possible solutions for their quality performance . It is extremely important for the 

 performance indicators to be designed and measured across the strategic objectives of the 

 company ; otherwise , there is no point of focusing on them . I explained to them that strategy is a 

 main part of any business and in order to achieve the strategies , a business has to be on the right 

 path in terms of measuring its performance as well . The performance indicators need to be relevant 

 or else they can lead to incompletion of strategic objectives . The story part also included a scenario 

 in which a company ’s quality was highly compromised due to its delay of delivering the timely 

 information . It was meant to target the sectors that delay the delivery of scorecards due to delays 

 by their third party service providers . Such sectors also receive a negative customer feedback . 

 However , the story helped them in realizing the importance of timely deliveries by pushing their 

 service providers as well to deliver information on time . 

 Insight : 

 The idea of implementing storytelling tool overall proved to be beneficial , as the external parties 

 shifted to a more responsible approach of devising performance indicators that matched with their 

 strategic objectives , and ultimately helped them in gaining better results . However , it could not 

 really prove the best for those sectors that faced delays from their service providers because 

 ultimately they are dependent on them and can only rely on them to deliver on time , even after 

 emphasizing the need of urgency . 

 Approach : 

 The overall approach opted for the challenges at QCC proved to be fruitful for certain businesses 

 and not all businesses . This is because all businesses have their own different modes of operations 

 and performance indicators that comply with their overall strategic objectives , and so a storytelling 

 could not prove beneficial for all , as it could not deal with the situation of every business . In future , 

 I wish to focus more on a tool or approach that could cater all kinds of businesses and their quality 

 needs .

"Reflection - Visualisation 

 Challenge and selection 

 On a recent project , I was asked to work with a community who lived in a significantly biodiverse area   in <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> . It was assumed that the community would be happy to take on the mantle of custodian   of the environment , and take measures to protect and conserve it . However , it soon became apparent   that this was not the approach being taken by the community , and the area was under severe   environmental threat . The local municipality sought to engage with community members , in such a   way that members would see the benefit of becoming agents of natural resource management , and   conservation . 

 Although an anthropologist by profession , it is my background as a graphic designer that has enabled   me to help communities visualise their way into a new way of living . Using various visualisation   techniques has helped me on many occasions to breach the language barrier that is so prevalent in   <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , which has 11 official languages . By using visualisation techniques , such as Photovoice ,   we are able to better understand the current context of participants , their thoughts and opinions , as   well as their hopes for the future , in a way that pure dialogue would never enable .   Due to the   education system in rural <ADDRESS> <ADDRESS> , many people are not encouraged to think critically , and are   certainly not encouraged to be creative . Visualisation helps them to access creativity , and use parts of   the brain that have grown dormant . 

 Application 

 Two visualisation tools were chosen for this project . The first was Photovoice . Volunteers were   selected from the community , and attended an orientation , which described the purpose and   intention of the project . Volunteers then attended a basic photography workshop , and were given   disposable cameras to take home with them . They were asked to take photos that specifically   demonstrated how their environment was under threat , and could include issues such as soil erosion ,   waste disposal , water wastage , etc . After two weeks , cameras were collected , photos printed and a   workshop held with volunteers . It was during this phase that challenges arose . Firstly , some cameras   were not returned ; being the first and only device of its kind in the household , meant that it grew legs   and went off with the wrong person ( never to return ) . Secondly , some volunteers were threatened as   they were perceived to be “ spying on ” or invading the privacy of others . Due to <NAME> <NAME>   <NAME> in the area , people had become understandably sensitive . 

 During the workshop process , each volunteer took their photos and wrote a short narrative about why   they thought each photo demonstrated environmental degradation . The volunteers presented their   photos to the group and stuck the photos on a large whiteboard . Once all the photos were up , the   participants were asked to group the photos into themes , and then rank the groupings from mild to   severe . This synthesis of information helped to weed out the least problematic issues , and focus on   the main challenges . 

 The second visualisation tool was the creation of a vision board . The group was given a stack of   magazines and asked to create a vision board of the type of community they aspired to live in , using   pictures from the magazines . Two posters were then created , one of the current situation ( what is ) ,   and one of their aspiration community ( what if ) , and this was shared in a community workshop to   develop a community action plan , that the majority agreed upon . 

 Insight 

 As always , the findings of the project were a surprise to both the implementers and the participants .   On the one hand , community members shared that a lack of service delivery by the municipality in the   area , encouraged the degradation of the environment . Rubbish was not collected regularly , and   clearance of septic tanks were often left too long . On the other hand , overgrazing of cattle had led to   soil erosion , and vandalism of school properties ( such as science labs ) had adversely affected school   children . Community members , through the visual process , were able to identify their own actions   that led to degradation , but had also found a way to demonstrate to the municipality that lack of   municipal planning and delivery , had also contributed to the problem . Thus , an opportunity for   dialogue between the two was opened up , in their now mutual aspirations to improve the area . 

 Approach 

 In hindsight , more time would have been spent considering the socio - economic factors that might   have arisen and impacted negatively on the project . Issues such as distrust within the community , and   “ borrowing ” of goods perceived as now belonging to the family , certainly meant less data being   gathered . Other issues , such as the patriarchal hierarchy within the community , meant less women   spoke out in front of men , and perhaps next time , these two groups would be separated , to obtain a   more representative viewpoint .

"Design Thinking Assignment 

 Teaching Young Children To Read 

 Challenge 

 Children tend to begin to read , in earnest , when they begin school around the age of 5 .   Different   children develop their reading skills at different rates .   Many will develop a love a reading , whereas   others will struggle and hate it .   Several reading methods and tools have been developed over the   years with various success .   New digital technologies may offer new tools and methods to help find   new ways to engage young readers ; particularly those children who traditionally struggle with   learning to read . 

 I have chosen as my challenge identifying some new tools and/or methods for teaching young   children to read .   The focus for this assignment is the end of the “ What Is ” and “ What If ” stages of   Design Thinking . 

 Selection 

 I have selected the Mind Mapping Tool for this assignment .   The <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> would be used   to make sense of all the data gathered in the research phase .   It helps key stakeholders look for   patterns and insights into that data , which would help give me an idea of where some of the   problems and successes are with tools for teaching kids to read . This can then feed into the “ What   If ” stage . 

 Application 

 Firstly , I would conduct desk based background research to gather as many examples as possible to   identify all the current and past methods and aids for teaching beginner readers how to read .   I   would also conduct research on new methods and aids being proposed , and conduct some teacher   interviews to help put some of the research into context .   I would compile all this information   visually .   That is , construct flow diagrams , where appropriate , gather actual examples of teaching   and learning aids , get photos of some in use , etc . 

 Once all this data is compiled , I would conduct a Mind Mapping exercise .   All this data and learning   will then be collated and the mind mapping exercise can begin .   I would have all the visual aids   representing the data from the research exercise displayed around the room and invite a group of   stakeholders to come and “ view ” the information , collated in like - information sections .   The   stakeholders in this case would be teachers , parents and children who have been reading for several   years already . 

 I would ask the participants to make some notes on sticky notes about the “ good stuff ” – the   information they think might inform new ideas for learning to read .   I would take all the sticky notes   and collate them in themed clusters on a common wall for sorting , etc . 

 Insight 

 Note that this work is yet to be carried out .   However , this is a problem I have worked on ( indirectly )   in the past .   Previously , new teaching aids were proposed without a proper understanding of the 

 pros and cons of what already existed .   My insight gained from doing this course is that using the   <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> during the What Is stage should help gather far richer information than mere   researching alone .   This is because it can help cut through a lot of the noise of a high volume data set   to get to the heart of where opportunity lies for improvement . 

 Approach 

 An alternative approach would be to rely more on interviews with key stakeholders , making use of   the Visualization Tool .   This might cut down on the number of people required for the Mind Mapping   exercise ( improving logistics ) and also gain more indepth insight from key stakeholders .
